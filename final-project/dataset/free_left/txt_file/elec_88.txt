sen rand paul r ky announced wednesday that he is suspending his presidential campaign bringing an end to a bid that began with aspirations of expanding the libertarian base that his father ron paul built into a powerful national coalition it s been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the white house paul said in a statement today i will end where i began ready and willing to fight for the cause of liberty the low key senator as apt to quote a philosopher as to quote pink floyd struggled in a year dominated by hard line outsiders such as sen ted cruz tex and businessman donald trump in a call with reporters his campaign strategists bemoaned that the mogul had sucked the oxygen out of the race and admitted hat his non interventionist views on foreign policy were not embraced by republicans as terrorism and unrest raged abroad paul a first time candidate for national office also found it difficult to persuade the supporters of his father a former congressman from texas who sought the republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012 to back him with enthusiasm although popular among libertarians purists in that wing of the conservative movement questioned whether paul was too mainstream his decision to move to the middle and support a number of moderate republicans in the 2014 elections that sent us a real signal about the application of his ideology said drew ivers ron paul s 2012 iowa chairman who did not endorse rand paul he muddled on his message tried to get the left and i told him it would backfire i just saw someone trying to do too much and be too many things to too many people his name is paul i told him you can t defy gravity rand paul s ideological heritage is his greatest asset and his biggest challenge paul a 53 year old ophthalmologist was elected to the senate in 2010 as part of the gop s tea party wave he will return to his work in the chamber and to his senate reelection campaign where he remains a top target of democrats as they try to retake the majority this year according to paul s campaign aides the candidate decided to drop out after a disappointing finish in monday s iowa caucuses where his father had placed a strong third in 2012 thanks again to the people of iowa it was great getting to meet you i am especially grateful for the enthusiasm of students fight on over the past day paul began to inform his key aides and donors that he would leave the race then returned to washington d c to resume his work in the senate in his statement paul expressed confidence that his campaign while unsuccessful offered republicans an alternative by focusing on issues he thinks are crucial to attracting minorities and young people to the party across the country thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to our message of limited government privacy criminal justice reform and a reasonable foreign policy he said brushfires of liberty were ignited and those will carry on as will i although today i will suspend my campaign for president the fight is far from over i will continue to carry the torch for liberty in the united states senate and i look forward to earning the privilege to represent the people of kentucky for another term longtime associates of ron paul framed rand paul s departure from the race as a stumble rather than a crippling defeat in the younger paul s career and for their movement paul ally trygve olson said that libertarians and other conservatives probably would consider paul in a future presidential cycle that was less crowded and driven by a celebrity front runner rand paul remains the best advocate those conservative have in the united states senate olson said even if he didn t have the kind of success he wanted he s an important voice on a whole set of issues assuming he s reelected he will continue to be that voice and be the person putting them at the center of the radar olson said ron paul s star turn in the 2008 race was driven as much by the national political environment as it was by the candidate s performance when ron ran then he was able to tap into the angst that was out there about the war and foreign policy he said paul s method of campaigning echoed his father s he favoredsmall gatherings where he could make lengthy speeches and preferredorations that cited montesquieu while he was accessible to the media he did not relish banter with reporters or the glad handing demands of the campaign some candidates used every spare minute to meet potential voters reporters who ran into paul at an airport usually caught him reading a book but his ambitions were grand two years ago he became the first republican to assemble a network in all 50 states as a precursor to a presidential run a sign that he was looking to build a coalition that wasn t as ad hoc as his father s magazine covers proclaimed paul to be one of the party s brightest and most interesting voices a hemp wearing curly haired maverick who could in his words spread the republican message to voters with tattoos and without tattoos he began courting wall street titans and silicon valley entrepreneurs who had donated to the presidential campaigns of george w bush and mitt romney attending elite conclaves in utah and elsewhere his pitch combined his antagonism toward the national security agency s surveillance programs with what he called crunchy conservatism a prioritization of drug sentencing reform the environment and civil liberties in 2013 as the republican party was casting about for new leadership paul filibustered the nomination of the new fbi director and only quit the floor ten and a half hours later after the white house put out a letter clarifying whether american citizens could be targeted by drone attacks he got mixed reviews for a speech to black students at howard university but then hunkering down he reached out to black political leaders in kentucky and began talking more about criminal justice reform republican party chapters tapped paul to open offices in poverty stricken parts of louisville chicago and detroit i ve been to ferguson and i ve been to the south side of chicago he told a largely white audience of republicans in baltimore after the death of freddie gray in police custody sparked two days of rioting until we ve walked in someone else s shoes we shouldn t say we can t understand the anger of people few republicans talked like that in early 2014 paul was consistently leading or close to leading national polls a cnn orc international survey in march of that year found that 16percent of republicans and independents who lean republican were likely to support the senator putting him at the front of the republican field and giving him unusually strong support from black voters at home in kentucky paul loaned strategist turned nephew in law jesse benton to the re election campaign of now senate majority leader mitch mcconnell signaling that he had bridged a gap between the liberty movement and the republican elite some pundits like the atlantic s peter beinart suggested that paul was really the frontrunner to win a changing party s nomination and challenge presumed democratic nominee hillary clinton on traditionally liberal turf right now i m the only one that beats hillary clinton in certain purple states paul told fox news host megyn kelly shortly before his launch i m the only one that also scores above all the other republicans in whether or not i can beat her paul s may 2015 announcement tour started in lousiville and swept into the first four primary states finding sizable crowds his campaign led by republican strategist chip englander had a plan to finish at least second or third in all of the early states then take advantage of the long stirring paul organizations in the midwest and mountain west to collect delegates that never happened donald trump who entered the primary one month after paul charged ahead in polls and captured the outsider energy paul had claimed for years weak poll numbers scared off possible megadonors who had donated to ron paul like the venture capitalist peter thiel in august right before the first republican presidential debate benton was indicted over a 2012 scheme to flip an iowa state senator s endorsement to ron paul benton was later acquitted another more strategic challenge came from a man paul had endorsed in his bid for a senate seat in texas ted cruz talking openly about winning the liberty lane of the republican primary cruz lobbied supporters of ron paul to switch over and back a better funded campaign ashe struggled paul barely concealed his resentment for cruz s wrangling paul secured a standalone vote on defunding planned parenthood cruz vacuumed up the attention by calling to cut funds in the must pass spending bill paul won a new hampshire straw poll of libertarian leaning republicans cruz claimed victory with his own vote count paul told audiences that cruz had been nowhere to be found on a vote to audit the federal reserve voters did not seem to care this past sunday when the elder paul joined his son for a revolution themed rally on the university of iowa campus most of the press seats were empty only c span bothered to film a teleprompter delivered closing message paul s early exit calmed republicans who worried that his race for the white house was risking control of his senate seat which is on the 2016 ballot paul had worked hard to protect his day job paying 250 000 from his campaign account to fund a march presidential caucus which he now will not contest at the revolution rally early paul endorser rep thomas massie r ky said he was likely to pay for a poll of the state expecting it to show that paul could campaign through the next primaries without any risk to his senate seat in a wednesday radio interview cruz praised paul and reminded listeners that he hadalways been an ally of theliberty movement speaking to reporters in new hampshire sen marco rubio r fla a staunch critic of paul s foreign policy positions commended his senate colleague for running a good race and wished him luck in his reelection bid rand is someone i disagree with on a lot of issues but as i said the other night at the debate he believes strongly in what he stands for and i respect that said rubio he s a true believer on issues of limited government and the liberty issues and i respect it for him for it asked if he planned to ask paul for his endorsement rubio replied sure i mean i d love to have rand s support in a conference call with reporters wednesday morning paul strategist doug stafford reiterated that the senator would make no endorsements not even of cruz it did not matter especially that paul had endorsed the texan in his upstart 2012 senate primary rand endorsed many people for senate he said sean sullivan contributed to this post which has been updated more reading rand paul gets an opponent
