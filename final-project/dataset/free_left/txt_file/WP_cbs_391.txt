ad spending the highest in almost 20 years as part of an effort to reverse a decline in diamond sales according to a recentreportfrom bain and company and the antwerp world diamond centre polished

western style weddings are growing in popularity with a swelling middle class marketers have launched a hand in love campaign to associate diamonds with love and commitment according to bain in india a recent campaign called the most precious gift associates the birth of a child with a gift of diamonds but in america marriage rates are falling leading to a downturn in so called commitment jewelry accordingto a report from de beers which says the number of u s marriages declined by more than 3 from 2000 to 2017 so in campaigns like for me from me marketers have a new message women should buy diamonds for themselves as a sign of self empowerment and independence rather than waiting for a proposal and promises of eternal love prior to the 2000s the diamond industry was focused on sparking demand for diamonds rather than promoting a single brand according to bain that stemmed from the great depression when diamond sales were at all time low and americans primarily viewed diamond engagement rings as purchases for the very rich in 1947 de beers came up with its massively popular slogan a diamond is forever to imbue diamonds with emotional sentiments like romantic love and commitment as well as to convince consumers not to resell their jewelry by 1951 eight out of 10 brides in the u s received a diamond engagement ring in 1999 advertising age considered it the most successful slogan of the previous century but since then the diamond industry has dealt with a new set of problems for one american consumers don t have the same attachments to diamonds as their

that it s special i love it i see it in a mirror i see it in a dress and it makes me feel good barnett s experience echoes the trend of women buying jewelry for themselves analysts said women are living on their own more they may be taking care of others so they re more comfortable with taking their money and putting it back into themselves alexis desalva senior research analyst at mintel told cbs news i think this campaign is a really good example of how a brand is giving them permission to do that other women are choosing to pop the question to their significant others including the retired competitive ski racer and olympic medalist lindsey vonn after her fianc the nhl ice hockey player p k subban proposed in august vonn returned the favor on wednesday with his own engagement ring merry christmas and happy holidays everyone on our 2 year anniversary i returned the favor and asked pk to marry me and he said yes we talk about equality but actions speak louder than words men
