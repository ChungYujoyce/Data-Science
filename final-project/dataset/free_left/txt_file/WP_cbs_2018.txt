watch cbsn live by christopher robertson alison bateman house holly fernandez lynch keith joiner april 8 2020 1 18 pm the conversation hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been at the center of debate in recent weeks over which drugs should be used to treat covid 19 neither product has strong evidence to support use for this purpose and small studies reported to date have either had significant flaws or failed to demonstrate effect nonetheless the president can t seem to stop pushing them arguing that patients have nothing to lose as physicians bioethicists and drug law experts we have a responsibility to inject caution here as public officials and scientists rush to innovate no one should overlook the critical role of strong regulatory protections in supporting our ability to actually figure out which drugs work against covid 19 weakening commitment to science and evidence during this crisis truly would be a cure worse than the disease there are no food and drug administration approved drugs to treat covid 19 and no product has strong data to support its use against this disease nonetheless on march 28 the fda issued an emergency use authorization eua for certain hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the strategic national stockpile by various pharmaceutical companies the eua was granted exclusively to the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda allowing it to distribute these stockpiled drugs to local public health authorities for the unapproved use of treating hospitalized covid 19 patients unable to participate in clinical trials an eua is not the same as the fda s traditional marketing approval to be approved under normal rules drugs must be shown safe and effective for their intended use an eua in contrast is a temporary authorization granted in the face of a public health emergency based only on a determination that a product may be effective and that its likely benefits outweigh its likely risks this eua was supported only by limited in vitro and anecdotal clinical data in case series with no acknowledgment of contrary data or significant safety concerns overall it s sown even further confusion about the promise and uncertainties of these drugs an eua is not the only way that covid 19 patients may access hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine a physician is generally free to prescribe approved drugs for unapproved uses as part of their authority to practice medicine this is referred to as off label use because several hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine products have been fda approved for malaria lupus and rheumatoid arthritis they re eligible for off label use against covid 19 following president trump s comments that these drugs could be a potential game changer attention and prescriptions sky rocketed despite caution from experts some physicians stockpiled the drugs for personal use and several hospitals have adopted hydroxychloroquine as covid 19 standard of care although there have been efforts to help protect supply for those patients needing the drug for their proven indications some of these patients have been told they may have to go without it is too soon to say whether chloroquine products work for covid 19 since the few clinical studies are small and lack randomization or carefully matched control groups severe side effects have caused some hospitals to stop using them altogether there is a great need for rigorously conducted clinical trials on these products and their possible effectiveness in fighting covid 19 but if physicians continue prescribing them off label without regard for appropriate testing we ll be left with anecdotes not evidence there are other drugs with some potential to combat covid 19 but that have not yet been approved for any use and therefore may not be prescribed off label these drugs are currently under investigation in clinical trials around the u s and the globe for seriously ill patients the fda has a pathway known as expanded access sometimes called compassionate use by which patients may be dosed with unapproved drugs for treatment use if they are unable to enroll in a clinical trial this eligibility restriction is critical because it ensures that patients cannot secure access by opting out of the trials designed to produce the evidence needed to confidently assess a product s safety and efficacy drug maker gilead has emphasized this approach with its investigational antiviral drug remdesivir even as it opens its expanded access program through a wider pathway the company has explained that participation in clinical trials will be the primary mode of patient access pragmatism is needed to collect data in real time as patients are also in desperate need of treatment that s precisely the approach taken by the world health organization in its mega trial of four potential treatments for covid 19 including remdesivir and chloroquine products with over 70 countries participating the trial is aptly named solidarity and it is designed to minimize the burden on physicians and patients while allowing random assignment and collection of systematic anonymous data we simply have to stop guessing about what s going to work for patients battling covid 19 patients today and tomorrow need a commitment from politicians policymakers companies and physicians to prioritize science and rigorous study off label use and expanded access may be reasonable options for patients when there is no clinical trial available but if there is we have to prioritize enrollment the fda has demonstrated its willingness to help speed trials and facilitate the collection of data but its regulatory standards must not be short circuited and its flexibility must be used judiciously federal policy in this area should be driven by scientific expertise not false hope hunches or short sighted political demands about the authors christopher robertsonis professor of law at
