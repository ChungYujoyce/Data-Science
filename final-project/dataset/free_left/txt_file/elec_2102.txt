 2016 hillary s intimate policy seminar could not have been more different than donald s bombastic barbecue by hadas gold 07 26 2015 12 17 am edt winterset iowa more than 1 000 people crowded the grounds of oskaloosa high school on a hot and muggy saturday afternoon enjoying the decadent spread of free pulled pork sandwiches and lining up to sign on to a mailing list in exchange for t shirts and swag donald trump was in town advertisement the billionaire mogul gave a rowdy rally in his signature meandering yet riveting style he went after a new target scott walker calling his state a disaster and ripping the wisconsin governor s fiscal policies he regaled the crowd with tales of thursday s circus like trip to laredo texas where he toured the border and showcased his provocative attacks on illegal immigrants he spent the rest of his time lamenting the state of the country while touting what an amazing businessman he is who can do better than trump trump said i fix things hours away from oskaloosa former secretary of state hillary clinton held about as different a campaign event as one can get under a big sycamore tree on the grounds of the madison county historical complex a stone s throw from the birthplace of john wayne clinton met with an intimate group of less than 100 third district iowa democrats it s very nostalgic clinton skipping her trademark pantsuit for a more casual striped shirt and slacks said of the intimate gathering i spent all those years with bill in arkansas and we used to campaign under trees from one part of state to the other we were outdoors all the time we were in cattle barns rodeos wherever two or more gathered we had so much fun it was harder to do that in a national campaign but it s easier in iowa than in anywhere else that s why being here with you is so meaningful to me trump s rally by contrast was engineered to bring in a big crowd with a free catered barbecue spread attracting many families giving the event a celebratory affair attendees were even encouraged to take the extra food home what looked like a campaign bus emblazoned with trump stood in front of the entrance though trump arrived and left in a separate suv hillary s favored to win not against me she s not favored to win trump said he betrayed a little insecurity in going after walker who he said was finally fair game because one of the governor s donors had called him a dumb dumb she despite new questions about her email use as secretary of state was calm and at ease at times seeming within an inch of suggesting she already is the democratic nominee once we get into this contest we ll be able to show our ideas are superior clinton said but don t be mistaken this will be a tough election she averred before touting her history of tussling with republicans i ve got scar tissue to show what it takes to stand up to the other side and i will do just that trump with many of his now signature asides about his wife golf and his business acumen meandered through his remarks hitting on immigration veterans competition with china and japan and his problems with the rest of the republican party and washington we use caroline kennedy in japan she couldn t even believe she got the job they said would you like the job she said really but my daughter ivanka likes her so she has to be a good person trump said as he ridiculed the current administration s negotiating skills clinton dutifully went through her policy heavy stump speech ticking through her opposition to big money in politics and her support for early childhood education the affordable care act gay rights and elder care she didn t mention her democratic primary opponents even though former maryland governor martin o malley had just serenaded the crowd with three songs including a stirring rendition of this land is your land trump though had lots to say about walker wisconsin s doing terribly it s in turmoil the roads are a disaster because they don t have any money to rebuild them they re borrowing money like crazy they projected a 1 billion surplus and it turns out to be a deficit of 2 2 billion the schools are a disaster the hospitals and education was a disaster and he was totally in favor of common core he said to big cheers adding later i wrote all this stuff down though i don t need to though because i ve got a really good memory trump was also sure to sell the crowd on his resume i m very good with contracts don t you want that i went to wharton school of finance i was a really good student he obliquely responded to criticism of his slam of mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals and his attack on arizona sen john mccain as a fraudulent war hero if it wasn t for me you would ve never heard of a sanctuary city he said trump also touted his relationship with veterans asking a staff member to bring to the stage a foot high stack of papers what he said were hundreds of letters veterans had written to him in just the past day veterans are being treated like third class citizens in this country and they re our best trump said as many in the crowd waved veterans for trump signs no one fights for the veterans like me but all the bluster has yet to put him in the lead in iowa where he trails walker in recent polls will you please put me in first place so i feel better he asked the crowd missing out on the latest
