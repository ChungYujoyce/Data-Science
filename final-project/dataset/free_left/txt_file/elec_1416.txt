with about two months left in the campaign the national race between hillary clinton and donald trump has gotten closer but clinton still appears to be solidly ahead in more than enough swing states to deliver her the presidency yes the race seems to have tightened since clinton s peak in the early august post convention period at that time hillary clinton s lead over trump in national polls rose to around 8 to 9 points on average and now appears to be something more like 3 to 5 points trump has even led the occasional poll lately and in key swing states there have been fewer polls showing clinton up by eye popping double digit margins in contrast to early august but current polling averages for both realclearpolitics and huffpost pollster do still show clinton leading donald trump in almost every traditional swing state furthermore clinton remains not only ahead but pretty comfortably ahead in states that would be enough to provide her with a majority of electoral college votes in the below map i ve projected states to clinton or trump if either is leading both polling averages by 5 or more points and kept the closer states as undecided as you can see clinton currently has enough solid looking leads to top 270 electoral vote that would give her a win now there have been more national polls recently than state polls so it s possible that the swing state data is a bit outdated and doesn t fully reflect the national tightening and there could of course be more movement in the coming weeks particularly once the debates get started still it would take a pretty dramatic shift or polling failure overall to tip the election to trump and historical precedent is on clinton s side as the candidate ahead by this point in the election cycle has almost always gone on to win in recent decades clinton starts off with a bloc of 201 votes or so that have always seemed to solidly be in her column give or take one electoral vote from maine s second congressional district from there her easiest path to to victory appears to be clinton came out of the conventions with bigger than usual bounces in all six of these states indeed she s led every single poll conducted in each of them since mid july and many by very large double digit margins furthermore clinton s campaign has omitted four of these states wisconsin michigan colorado and virginia from its latest round of targeted swing state ad buys this suggests that clinton s team views her lead in each of these four as quite safe for now at least if trump doesn t manage to pry at least one of the above states out of clinton s hands his loss is assured but he needs to do more than that he needs to win all or nearly all of the remaining swing states too most of which clinton is currently favored in these include the traditional big prizes of florida and ohio as well as the rapidly diversifying north carolina since the conventions clinton has posted leads in the low to mid single digits in all three and then nevada and iowa which both appear to be quite close round out the traditional swing state lineup finally there s a few traditionally red states that have ended up looking surprisingly close this year most notably arizona and georgia where trump has very small leads in poll averages it s also worth keeping in mind that the clinton campaign seems to have two key advantages in battleground states that might not show up in national polling first clinton has heavily outspent trump in advertising in swing states until late august in fact trump s campaign had spent nothing on general election ads while clinton has spent tens of millions second by all accounts the clinton team has set up a more organized and disciplined campaign operation in swing states for instance as of late august clinton had 34 campaign offices in florida but trump had just one so if clinton s team is better able to identify and turn out its voters during early voting and on election day her margin in polls could be padded even further overall the current polling points to a strong electoral vote win for clinton resembling barack obama s margin of victory over john mccain in 2008 but democrats have dreamed of doing even better hoping that trump s unpopularity could carry clinton to a nationwide landslide there are a few data points that have given democrats reason to hope this is happening occasional polls have shown clinton close or ahead in deep red bastions like south carolina and texas and since these states are even less frequently polled than swing states it s difficult to get a sense of what s been going on there still if current polls are accurate a clinton landslide doesn t appear likely for that clinton would need to expand her national lead which instead has been shrinking of late she d also need voters across many red states to outright reject trump when most of those voters instead appear to be falling behind him get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
