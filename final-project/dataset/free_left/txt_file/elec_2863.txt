 2016 at this stage in the republican primary fight no one has the edge by eli stokols 04 21 2015 05 56 am edt updated 04 22 2015 03 24 pm edt with one well received january speech in iowa scott walker shot to the top of the polls after a successful campaign launch marco rubio is slowly gaining ground with donors and with conservatives who see a candidate with an inspiring biography and exceptional skills as a communicator yet it s jeb bush who s frequently described as the front runner in a crowded field of more than a dozen republican candidates the reality is that he s not at this stage in the nominating contest no one is advertisement the republican nomination is wide open said ana navarro a miami based strategist who is close to bush we ll try many flavors of the month before we settle on one bush the former florida governor who hasn t run for office in 13 years seemed impressive right out of the gate with his sudden aggressive moves last november he sent strong enough signals to box out mitt romney the 2012 nominee who d been toying with a third run for the white house and began securing commitments from gop operatives to work on his eventual campaign and from the donors needed to fund it also on politico lauren french based on the early show of strength bush was anointed the clear republican front runner last december referencing a poll showing him leading the field with 23 percent of the overall republican vote nationwide now as the field is beginning to take shape and voters are hearing more about other candidates it s clear that bush is sitting right there on the starting line with everyone else walker rubio rand paul ted cruz chris christie and more than a dozen second tier candidates less likely to affect the battle for the nomination from his position on common core to immigration reform to his family name it s become abundantly clear bush has a lot to overcome for all the substance and thoughtfulness he s brought to the enterprise to date many republicans simply hunger for a younger fresher face and more ardently conservative stances from the party s next standard bearer no voter has ever raced to put a bumper sticker on their car because a candidate has the most money and best organization said kevin madden a gop strategist who advised romney in 2012 they want someone with a bold vision who can provide a new direction and offer a stark contrast to hillary clinton bush s challenges were evident this past weekend in new hampshire a state he may have to win where he performed flawlessly over three days last week yet seemed to generate less excitement from audiences than several of his rivals also on politico adam b lerner he responded smartly to a woman who stood up during a politics and eggs event at st anselm college and told him she didn t want a coronation saying he doubted one was coming his way but even the right answer and pitch perfect tone couldn t dispel the dynastic aura surrounding a man whose father and brother have both been elected president especially with large framed photographs of them hanging high on the walls around the meeting room it s going to be tough for bush to be the shiny new thing in the way that a rubio or a walker could be said dante scala a political science professor at the university of new hampshire after holding forth for nearly an hour and demonstrating fluency on a range of policy areas bush met the press in a small room down the hall the questions there focused on nagging political issues the bush brand and whether rubio who bush mentored as a young florida lawmaker stabbed his friend in the back by entering the presidential race can you compare your foreign policy approach to your brother s asked one reporter no bush replied also on politico katie glueck it s not a question bush will be able to avoid but campaign advisers believe the 10 months from now until the start of primary season will be enough time to address the differences between jeb and his brother to clarify his own ideas and beliefs so that in the end people see a candidate who is his own man and willing to work for the nomination if bush can no longer claim the mantle of front runner it s due at least in part to the rise of some of his rivals and the early traction they ve gained walker the wisconsin governor has a recent record of conservative reform and shows potential to win support from the more moderate gop establishment and the party s tea party base rubio the florida senator looks to have the backing of enough well heeled donors to build a serious organization he appeals to a wide swath of conservatives who like his hawkishness on foreign policy and recognize that his unique charisma and inspiring biography could make him a formidable general election candidate few doubt that bush who s expected to raise more money than any other candidate in the field is built for the long haul his ability to build a broader more diverse coalition and his resources will enable him to run a campaign in much larger and more expensive states like florida where a week of tv ads airing statewide will run at least 3 million also on politico daniel lippman but first he must run the early state gantlet where the conservative grass roots in states like iowa and south carolina aren t yet enamored of him that makes new hampshire where bush is better situated a critical test at the moment bush trails walker in the polls in all three of those states the early states don t come easy said stuart stevens chief strategist media adviser for romney s 2012 campaign if you want to win the nomination you ve got to win one of the first four unlike romney in 2012 bush may not be able to count on his rivals collapsing and voters coming home to him a less exciting but safe choice for lack of viable options i m impressed by the quality of the field scala said it s not mitt romney and a bunch of b list c list candidates it s a quality field i can imagine that activists are just kind of enjoying the buffet at this point james hohmann and cate martel contributed to this report missing out on the latest scoops sign up for
