 2016 there have been drips of information leaking out from an upcoming book recently it turned into a gush by nick gass 04 23 2015 08 45 am edt updated 04 23 2015 08 38 pm edt hillary clinton s camp is swinging back at what has become a deluge of reports detailing perceived conflicts of interest and a lack of transparency about her family foundation s acceptance of foreign cash but top aides are so far stopping short of full on panic mode over the past week drips of information have leaked out from an upcoming book by conservative author peter schweizer clinton cash the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses help make bill and hillary rich it turned into a gush in the past 24 hours with reports from the new york times politico the washington post reuters bloomberg and the wall street journal that were spawned from the book or touched on similar territory advertisement there is an underlying theme in these reports that has dogged the clintons for decades and has freshly come to the fore early in hillary clinton s second run for the white house the couple s secretive tendencies and their connections to big sums of cash in a sign of heightening concerns the most pointed query from donors on thursday at a new york city fundraising kick off was how do we respond to questions about these allegations also on politico nick gass clinton campaign chairman john podesta played it cool if we try to chase every media story we chase our own tail we re not going to do that a donor in attendance recalled podesta saying he told them that spokesman brian fallon had issued a very detailed response to the allegations in the book and that negative stories and attacks were simply par for the course for the clintons fallon distributed an updated memo to the campaign s surrogates and allies on thursday going a few steps further than his tuesday night memo questioning schweizer s credibility fallon s new memo labels the book a forthcoming smear project he writes that the primary conclusion to draw is that schweizer s book fails to produce a shred of evidence supporting the theory that hillary clinton ever took action as secretary of state for the purposes of supporting the interests of donors to the clinton foundation the clinton campaign s strategy to date has failed to stem the flood of negative media coverage also on politico david hume kennerly according to a report by the new york times on thursday contributions flowed into the clinton foundation between 2009 and 2013 as a russian atomic energy agency rosatom took over canadian based uranium one which had far reaching uranium holdings that sale according to the times gave the russian company control of one fifth of all uranium production capacity in the united states clinton s state department was one of the numerous u s government agencies that approved the deal which was required since uranium production represents a national security asset the chairman of uranium one made four donations to the clinton foundation through his family foundation totaling 2 35 million those contributions were not publicly disclosed according to the times report despite an agreement clinton made with president barack obama s administration to publicly disclose all donors and donations fallon told the times that no one has ever produced a shred of evidence supporting the theory that hillary clinton ever took action as secretary of state to support the interests of donors to the clinton foundation the suggestion that the state department exerted undue influence on the review of the sale is utterly baseless he said also on politico jack shafer in another example of the clintons money and transparency problem reuters reported thursday that the clinton family s charities are refiling at least five annual tax returns because of errors in reporting donations from foreign governments the errors are on forms called 990 which the irs requires charity organizations to file every year to keep their tax exempt status starting in 2010 and continuing for three years the clinton foundation s report said that it did not receive any funds from foreign and u s governments a stark contrast from reported donations in the previous years we are prioritizing an external review to ensure the accuracy of the 990s from 2010 2011 and 2012 and expect to refile when the review is completed a foundation spokesman told reuters the foundation s clinton health access initiative or chai is also refiling its form 990s for at least 2012 and 2013 a spokeswoman said according to the report the program which provides more affordable pharmaceuticals to hiv patients around the world said its initial filings overreported government grants by more than 100 million the washington post s clinton headline focused on the companies and organizations that are major donors to the clinton foundation and have also paid former president bill clinton at least 26 million in speaking fees since he left office it s yet another indication of the close relationship between the clintons charity work and growing personal wealth also on politico gabriel debenedetti the post s analysis found that four speeches by bill clinton were nowhere to be found on the former secretary of state s disclosure forms one of them was to the carlyle group a private equity firm with political pull politico reported on wednesday that schweizer s book alleges that among other things donor cash influenced clinton s position on a trade deal with colombia while she was at the state department the clinton foundation is not the only albatross for the clinton campaign which was formally launched less than two weeks ago hillary clinton is facing a simmering controversy over her use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state which was not standard protocol and fuels further allegations of secrecy news emerged late wednesday that the presidential candidate s lawyer rejected a private interview with the house select committee investigating the 2012 benghazi attacks when she was secretary of state there is no reason to delay her appearance or to have her testify in a private interview david kendall wrote in a letter to chairman trey gowdy r s c clinton s campaign chairman offered further explanation and criticized republicans request for a private meeting hillary clinton has already spent five hours testifying at two congressional committee hearings but as she s been saying since last year she s happy to do it again john podesta said unfortunately republicans insist her testimony is done behind closed doors where the american public is unable to see their true politically motivated intentions republican presidential contenders have seized upon the controversy swirling around the clintons kentucky sen rand paul has said schweizer briefed him on the book and that americans are going to be blown away by its contents he is asking supporters to provide more information about the clinton foundation s acceptance of contributions from foreign governments i m readyforhillary to return all the money she raised from foreign nations texas sen ted cruz tweeted with a link to his campaign website the lasting damage of the headlines is unclear especially if the clinton campaign can successfully reduce the reports to partisan attacks that turn off that american public also clinton is not seen as the only ripe target bloomberg reported on thursday that schweizer is working on a book about republican presidential contender jeb bush what we re doing is a drill down investigation of jeb s finances similar to what we did with the clintons in terms of looking at financial dealings cronyism who he s been involved with schweizer told bloomberg
