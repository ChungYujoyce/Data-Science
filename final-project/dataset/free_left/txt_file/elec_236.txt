conducted jan 20 23 by jonathan martin and sydney ember des moines senator bernie sanders has opened up a lead in iowa just over a week before the democratic caucuses consolidating support from liberals and benefiting from divisions among more moderate presidential candidates who are clustered behind him according to a new york times siena college poll of likely caucusgoers mr sanders has gained six points since the last times siena survey in late october and is now capturing 25 percent of the vote in iowa pete buttigieg the former mayor of south bend ind and former vice president joseph r biden jr have remained stagnant since the fall with mr buttigieg capturing 18 percent and mr biden 17 percent the rise of mr sanders has come at the expense of his fellow progressive senator elizabeth warren she dropped from 22 percent in the october poll enough to lead the field to 15 percent in this survey senator amy klobuchar who is garnering 8 percent is the only other candidate approaching double digits the changing fortunes of the leading candidates underscores the volatile nature of the primary after more than a year of campaigning as voters wrestle with which candidate can defeat president trump despite the ascent of mr sanders a self described democratic socialist the poll also highlighted the combined appeal of the centrists 55 percent of those surveyed said they preferred a standard bearer who is more moderate than most democrats just 38 percent said they wanted one who is more liberal than most democrats as the strength of the other leading candidates has ebbed and flowed mr sanders making his second run for the white house appears to be peaking at the right time this month was the first time he has finished atop a poll in iowa after also leading a des

would represent a remarkable comeback for a 78 year old candidate whose heart attack in october threatened to upend his candidacy it would also create a moment of high anxiety for establishment aligned democrats who are deeply alarmed about a potential sanders nomination should he prevail in iowa and face a similarly fractured field of mainstream rivals in new hampshire where he also currently leads in the polls mr sanders could be difficult to slow several voters who backed mr sanders cited the consistency of his positions over the course of his career and their ideological alignment with his views bernie s authentic said austin sturch 25 of evansdale adding pretty much everything he s saying i can t put it better than he can still much here remains uncertain iowa voters are famous for settling on a candidate late and this year is no different mr sanders along with the other senators in the race is pinned down in washington during mr trump s impeachment trial and unable to campaign here on weekdays and the final results could turn on two factors that will not be known until caucus night the size and composition of the electorate and the preferences of voters whose first choices are eliminated because of the arcane caucus rules if the other leading candidates finish bunched together on caucus night on feb 3 it is unlikely any of them will drop out of the race after iowa each of the three top hopefuls trailing mr sanders has the money to compete in new hampshire which is just a week later transcript this was iowa caucus night back in the mid 1970s and these are members of the national media covering the voting it was so unusual to see national media in iowa back then that people actually paid to watch them the democratic party charged 15 a head for people to watch the media watch the people see in previous years iowa s caucuses just hadn t attracted national attention there are 3 000 frozen media members in downtown des moines just over a decade later iowa is the place to be it s iowa caucus night let s party shouting the caucuses are now a key part of the presidential election cycle bush 57 they re the first chance to see what kind of support candidates have among voters so how did we get here from caucuses that only iowans seem to care about to the national spectacle we see today turns out a lot of it was accidental for most of iowa s history its caucuses were dominated by political insiders there was little room for input from rank and file members an historian writing in the 1940s put it like this the larger number of party voters were deprived of a voice but the old ways start coming to an end in 1968 the country s in turmoil and so is the democratic party mostly over the vietnam war and civil rights basically the party establishment wants to handle things one way and many rank and file members have other ideas all this comes to a head as the democrats hold their national convention protesters gather outside so do police inside the mood is also tense all this division leads the democratic party to rethink the nomination rules to include the voices of all party members in the process this is how we come to the moment when iowa becomes key to electing a president basically by accident first up how iowa became first to hold a presidential contest it starts with new rules to give everyday members more of a say so by 1972 winning iowa now involves four stages iowans choose their top candidates first at the precinct level these are the caucuses at the heart of this story but technically there s further voting at the county congressional district and state levels the new rules make things a lot more inclusive but this creates new delays committees need to be formed and everyone needs to have up to date party materials the problem is the state party only has an old mimeograph machine to make copies of all this it s really slow so because of an old machine and a bunch of new logistics the party decides it needs at least a month between each step to do it all the national convention is set for early july so you d think that the state level convention would happen about a month before in june except the party can t find a venue that s available to hold everyone that little detail helps push everything earlier in a chain reaction see what s going on here the precinct caucuses now have to happen early in the year the party chooses a date that makes iowa s the first presidential contest the new hampshire primary has been the first kickoff contest since the 1950s but iowa democrats aren t necessarily looking for national attention they just think it ll be fun to be first still attention is what they get the story begins with george mcgovern people didn t know much about the iowa caucuses as a matter of fact there wasn t a great deal of interest in them he s the long shot candidate he s been at the bottom of national polls he often walked the campaign trail alone little known by the voters most people think this guy edmund muskie is going to be the big winner in iowa that challenge is great but we can meet it then comes caucus night as the people vote state party officials gather at their headquarters richard bender is one of them and we had about 10 or 12 press people show up these press people included one guy johnny apple johnny apple a 37 year old political correspondent for the new york times iowa s democrats aren t ready to publicize the results right away they hadn t expected much demand according to bender only johnny apple asked for them that night i happen to be fascinated with such things so i made it my business beforehand to understand it bender sets up a phone tree to gather results from across the state he adds them up himself with a calculator and the next day apple s article helps swing the national spotlight onto the caucuses he s got quite the story to tell muskie s won but just barely not the runaway win people were expecting and mcgovern comes in a strong second no one expected that either the reformed caucus rules helped a long shot candidate rise to the top and because this is happening so early in the election now and because apple s article gives the results national coverage something else happens that got picked up by some of the national news shows the democratic front runner has been damaged in iowa and wow all of a sudden we were being paid attention to mcgovern eventually wins the democratic nomination i accept your nomination with a full and grateful heart he loses the presidential election but some haven t forgotten what those early caucuses did for mcgovern including georgia s former governor jimmy carter three years later there was a major headline on the editorial page of the atlanta constitution that said jimmy carter s running for what laughter and the what was about this big applause i m running for president carter heads to iowa before any other democratic candidate he s got no national profile he didn t have hordes of press following him around it was a very lonely campaign washington pundits call his candidacy laughable i remember when we couldn t find a microphone jimmy who becomes a catchphrase carter s own campaign film plays it up jimmy who i don t know who he is but as long as iowans come to know him and like him carter bets that the media will start paying attention just like with mcgovern four years earlier carter campaigns as locally as possible one day he learns that he s been invited on a local tv show and i said that is great i can t believe it i said what are we going to do he said do you have any favorite recipes and i said what do you mean recipes he said well this is a cooking show well they put a white apron on me and a chef s hat that was my only access to tv when i first began to campaign in iowa his opponents are in iowa too but they spend far less time there carter wins surprisingly top of the class after his win in a somewhat obscure race in iowa against the others you can t tell until we go to the other 49 states but it s encouraging for us a year later i jimmy carter do solemnly swear he becomes the 39th president now we need to head to 1980 because we haven t talked about the republicans yet here s the state s republican chairman that year he s asked why iowa s caucuses have become so important i think because jimmy carter got his start in iowa in 1976 the republicans in iowa are keen to copy the democrat s success and one candidate in particular gets inspired by carter s underdog win george h w bush he s running against ronald reagan bob dole and others and he s near the bottom of the pack your name isn t really a household word but ronald reagan can but bush goes big in iowa he gets a surprise win it s a far cry from just months before i was an asterisk in those days and my feelings got hurt and now i m no longer an asterisk bush is now the third underdog to get a boost from the caucuses the next morning on cbs he distills the essence of this new iowa effect we will have forward big mo on our side as they say in athletics big mo yeah mo momentum bush loses to reagan but becomes vice president and the desire to capture the big mo from iowa has only grown thanks in large part to iowa s embrace of being first and the media storm that descends every four years that s despite the fact that most candidates who win this is a job interview don t become president plus many point out that the state s overwhelmingly white population doesn t reflect the country s diversity i actually think that we can find places that represent that balance of urban and rural better but the race to get the big mo out of iowa persists because it s the first chance to upend expectations and put political fates in the voters hands and should no clear moderate alternative to mr sanders emerge from the early nominating states the self financing michael r bloomberg who has already spent more than 260 million on advertising and hired more than 1 000 staff members is awaiting the field on super tuesday in early march but first is iowa where the race remains up for grabs to an unusual degree so late in the race in the times poll nearly 40 percent of voters said they could still be persuaded to caucus for a different candidate mr sanders however has some of the most committed supporters in the race and significantly his advantage with iowa democrats does not ebb when the field is narrowed to only the top four candidates the vermont senator still leads by seven points in that scenario according to the survey capturing 30 percent of the vote while mr biden and mr buttigieg both win 23 percent and ms warren garners 19 percent these results are important because of how the caucuses work in iowa candidates must receive 15 percent support in a precinct to reach what is called viability meaning they are eligible to win delegates if a candidate falls short of that number his or her supporters can either leave the caucus or support better performing contenders for the second and final vote of the evening so voters second choices can prove crucial the iowa caucuses are around the corner as you get ready for primary season take a look at our cheat sheet on the race ms warren according to the poll is the top second choice preference of caucusgoers which could lift her candidacy after the initial vote but that is in part because she is the preferred alternative for those who support mr sanders who will most likely meet the viability threshold in nearly all of the caucuses ms warren received a boost saturday night however when she won the endorsement of iowa s largest and most influential newspaper the des moines register ms klobuchar s supporters could play the most crucial role though should she fail to achieve 15 percent in most precincts when voters were asked whom they would support if they were left with only four choices mr sanders mr buttigieg mr biden and ms warren mr biden was the overwhelming favorite of ms klobuchar s backers he received 55 percent of them in this scenario while ms warren received 18 percent one troubling sign for mr sanders came in an ideological matchup with mr trump in the times siena poll 56 percent of caucusgoers said they thought a democratic socialist would have a harder rather than an easier time defeating the president a higher number than those who said the same about a woman a gay candidate or one over 75 in fact among general election voters in iowa a state he carried by nearly 10 points four years ago mr trump defeated all of the top five candidates as well as mr bloomberg in head to head matchups he bested mr sanders 48 percent to 42 percent if the 2020 u s presidential election were held today who would you vote for trump 45 buttigieg 44 trump 46 biden 44 trump 46 klobuchar 41 trump 47 warren 42 trump 48 sanders 42 trump 47 bloomberg 39 if the 2020 u s presidential election were held today who would you vote for trump 45 buttigieg 44 trump 46 biden 44 trump 46 klobuchar 41 trump 47 warren 42 trump 48 sanders 42 trump 47 bloomberg 39 source new york times siena college poll conducted jan 20 23 more broadly the survey of iowa democrats showcases the same generational and ideological divisions that the party is grappling with nationally and helps illuminate why voters are so deeply divided over whom to support mr sanders leads with iowa voters under 30 taking 40 percent of that bloc which is more than double his nearest competitor in the demographic but he is winning only 9 percent among voters 65 and older at the same time mr biden is capturing 32 percent of the vote among those over 65 but receiving just 10 among the youngest iowa caucusgoers mr sanders s advantage owes largely to voters who align with his progressive agenda 43 percent of caucusgoers who call themselves very liberal are supporting his bid well above the next closest candidate at the same time those voters who are closer to the political center are split among moderate or conservative caucusgoers 25 percent are backing mr biden 21 percent are for mr buttigieg and 12 percent are with ms klobuchar among those who say they are somewhat conservative ms klobuchar garners 28 percent mr buttigieg 17 percent and mr biden 15 percent of course voters here do not always fall neatly along ideological lines shawn reynolds a 68 year old retired art teacher from des moines said she supported ms warren but mr biden was her second choice i m really on the fence i guess between the two of them said ms reynolds adding that she planned to caucus for ms warren and had even volunteered to help set up the warren corner at her precinct on caucus night despite her ambivalence if you support one of the following candidates as your first choice who among these four do you think has the best chance of defeating president trump support biden best chance warren 1 biden sanders 82 7 buttigieg 1 support

buttigieg 48 34 warren 2 source new york times siena college poll conducted jan 20 23 there were several signs in the poll illustrating why ms warren has fallen in iowa since her peak last fall many voters in iowa are fixated on elevating a candidate who can beat mr trump but 38 percent of likely caucusgoers said they thought a female candidate would have a harder time beating mr trump and only 51 percent of those who indicated ms warren was their first choice said she would be the best at beating mr trump and while ms warren s support fell across nearly all groups in the poll her decline was particularly pronounced among young voters just 16 percent of 18 to 29 year olds supported her in the poll down from 38 percent in october ms warren has also been trying to quell concerns about her sweeping agenda particularly medicare for all and its impact on the general election those efforts appear to have hurt her with some voters here the poll showed that only 18 percent of likely caucusgoers think she would be best at improving health care compared to 32 percent for mr sanders those findings bode well for mr sanders if ms warren does not regain her footing he can continue to solidify the backing of progressive voters who say they want fundamental change another advantage for mr sanders is that he has retained many of his supporters from 2016 when his near victory against mrs clinton turned him into a credible threat for the democratic nomination 48 percent of likely caucusgoers who said mr sanders was their first choice said they had caucused for him last time too among those voters was deborah marlin a 54 year old small business owner from clarinda who said her top issues were medicare for all and student debt he gives people a voice who have not had a voice before she said he sees the unseen such as people with disabilities low income workers people with medical conditions he sees the younger people in financial distress asked whether she had a second choice candidate she said she did not i m a bernie or bust she said nate cohn and nick corasaniti contributed reporting the new york times siena college research institute survey of 1 689 registered voters in iowa including 584 democratic caucusgoers was conducted from jan 20 to jan 23 the margin of error due to sampling is plus or minus 4 8 percentage points for the democratic caucus electorate
