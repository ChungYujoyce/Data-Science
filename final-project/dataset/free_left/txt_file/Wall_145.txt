this week in an interview in taipei we have to fight for our participation taiwan with a population of 23 million has reported 426 cases of coronavirus and six deaths as of wednesday far fewer than many countries the island stands out for having avoided painful and costly lockdowns by moving quickly to impose travel restrictions screen visitors and deploy protective gear that it had stockpiled for years taiwan has even been able to continue with its baseball season albeit without the crowds holding its opening game this month analysis what will our post virus normal feel like hints are beginning to emerge taiwan s diplomatic and public relations campaign is drawing fire from beijing which has dismissed the effort as an attempt to seek independence under the pretext of the pandemic taiwan s push for greater global recognition has in large part been an effort to raise questions about the cost of china s campaign to isolate the island diplomatically china has worked to shut taiwan out of groups like the world health organization a u n agency denying it access to scientific briefings and emergency meetings mr chen the vice president said that taiwan had been left as an orphan because of china no country can fight covid 19 alone said mr chen an epidemiologist by training he said the island wanted a chance to share our knowledge and experience and our technologies with other countries while taiwan s push for a greater voice in the health agency has drawn supportive comments from officials in the united states japan canada and elsewhere experts say it is unlikely to result

trainings and research conferences related to the virus the debate over taiwan s exclusion has at times been heated the director general of the w h o dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus facing criticism

claims and her government has said that the online attacks were coordinated by beijing the island wants to push a simple message taiwan can help but underlying it is a multifaceted effort to challenge beijing in the realm of coronavirus aid diplomacy beijing hopes that deliveries of masks ventilators and other aid to countries hit hard by the pandemic will help reshape the narrative and deflect from questions about how its initial efforts to conceal it made the pandemic worse taiwan a major manufacturer of masks and other hospital equipment is offering an alternative source of aid and winning accolades for its response on tuesday for instance the foreign minister of lithuania praised taiwan s donations as a genuine act of solidarity taiwan has even sought to use the pandemic to promote its manufacturing prowess pledging to export mask making machines by early august more broadly taiwan has tapped into rising concerns around the world about the costs of the chinese communist party s penchant for secrecy in contrast taiwan has presented its government as one that exudes confidence as it welcomes civic participation and the scrutiny of the press when china last month expelled reporters from three american news organizations including the new york times taiwan s foreign minister joseph wu sought to use the opportunity to burnish taiwan s credentials as a bastion of free speech on twitter he welcomed the reporters to move to taiwan a country that is a beacon of freedom democracy even ms tsai the president has adopted a more public diplomatic strategy casting aside her usual approach of working behind the scenes in reaching out to foreign leaders she has in recent days traded messages of encouragement on twitter with japan s prime minister shinzo abe such conversations which have been widely shared on social media sites represent the kind of public leader to leader exchanges that china has long sought to prevent in december 2016 for example china denounced ms tsai s congratulatory phone call to donald j trump then the president elect there are risks in taiwan s campaign chinese officials were already angered when in the early days of the epidemic taiwan shut its borders to visitors from the mainland hong kong and macau and imposed a ban on the export of masks the island could further antagonize china at a time when the ruling communist party is pushing through hard line actions including mass surveillance efforts in the mainland and a crackdown on pro democracy activists in hong kong beijing has shown no signs of easing its aggression toward taiwan despite the pandemic sending warships into the waters off its coast some commentators in china have threatened economic punishment if the island continues making diplomatic overtures chinese officials have accused taiwan of working to make reckless political maneuvers and hype up its participation in global organizations their scheme will never succeed zhao lijian a spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry said this month at a news conference in beijing now some in taiwan worry that beijing might more severely restrict trade with the island politically we want to keep a distance but economically it s very difficult said alex chiang a retired professor of diplomacy at national chengchi university in taipei after the covid crisis is over we still have to go to china and cooperate with chinese businesspeople in order to get economic recovery started mainland analysts argue that taiwan s moves to assert itself will worsen tensions between china and the united states china is already upset that president trump last month signed legislation aimed at discouraging taiwan s few remaining diplomatic allies from cutting ties with the island under pressure from beijing this will increase conflicts or even confrontations between china and u s said zhang wensheng associate dean at the taiwan research institute at xiamen university in eastern china taiwan s citizens say they are trying to ignore the mainland s threats many have in recent days joined the effort to raise the island s profile helping spread hashtags like taiwancanhelp and
