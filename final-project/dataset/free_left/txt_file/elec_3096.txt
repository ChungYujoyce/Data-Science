advertisement july 27 2016 arguments provocations and observations from times opinion writers related article times columnists editorial writers and contributors bring their insights to bear on hillary clinton and the democrats in philadelphia here are their notes and observations from day 2 and from day 1 philadelphia a country off the rails or one that makes steady if imperfect progress a land of disenchantment or of stubborn spectacular promise the intensifying battle between donald trump and hillary clinton is turning into a contest of those visions that became clearer than ever on the third night of the democratic national convention here as president obama answered trump s message of fear with a proclamation of hope as rousing and robust as any i ve heard america is already great obama said thundered really america is already strong and i promise you our strength our greatness does not depend on donald trump in fact it doesn t depend on any one person there s been a lot of talk in this campaign about what america has lost he added then flashed back to his kansas grandparents whom he d mentioned in the 2004 convention speech that introduced him to most americans and to the virtues of kindness courtesy humility responsibility that they preached america has changed over the years but these values that my grandparents taught they haven t gone anywhere he said they re as strong as ever still cherished by people of every party every race every faith they live on in each of us and with trump very much in mind he made clear we don t fear the future we shape it we embrace it it s hard frankly to stop quoting from his remarks because they amounted to one of the most moving inspiring valentines to this country that i ve ever heard brimming with regard for it and gratitude to it we re going to miss this man america whatever his flaws he s been more than our president time and again he s been our national poet he made trump look teeny tiny he may well make clinton look small too though that clearly wasn t and isn t his intent a high bar has been set for her speech on thursday night his speech reflected a fascinating role reversal this election cycle with the republicans or at least the republican presidential nominee speaking in stormy terms about america s failures while the democrats stress how much sunshine there really is at least since ronald reagan s declaration of morning again in america the g o p has tended toward optimism and uplift but trump has little interest in cheerleading so democrats have grabbed the pom poms obama even went so far as to claim reagan s perspective as the current democratic one and to use it to shame trump ronald reagan called america a shining city on a hill the president said donald trump calls it a divided crime scene that only he can fix earlier in the night vice president joe biden concluded his rawly infectiously emotional speech by shouting we are america second to none and we own the finish line don t forget it come on we re america obama biden and other democratic leaders are hardly ignoring america s heartaches on wednesday night as on tuesday speakers described and decried the human toll of senseless gun violence which was also mentioned in a video that preceded obama s appearance onstage but they paid tribute to the might of the united states military which trump has repeatedly questioned in a rah rah manner typically associated with republicans and obama and biden both answered trump s lament about america s supposedly lost greatness with assertions of its continued potency we have the finest fighting force in the world biden said not only do we have the largest economy in the world we have the strongest economy in the world we have the most productive workers in the world obama focused on our armed forces too saying donald trump calls our military a disaster apparently he doesn t know the men and women who make up the strongest fighting force the world has ever known that was striking and so were some of the characterizations of trump we live in bitterly partisan times with acridly partisan talk but the speakers on wednesday night weren t hurling the usual epithets at trump or saying simply that he was the much inferior candidate with the wrong estimation of america and the wrong plans for it they portrayed him as danger incarnate not just unprincipled and uninformed but possibly unhinged over the past decades i ve never heard a major political party s nominee discussed so cataclysmically risky reckless and radical is what michael bloomberg the former mayor of new york labeled him let s elect a sane competent person bloomberg said implying that trump was insane for obama defeating trump is personal a trump victory would not only unravel some of his proudest accomplishments but also contradict the story that he s been telling about america one of widening hearts and expanding social justice trump has repeatedly attacked obama in particular famously questioning whether he was really born in america and at a news conference on wednesday morning calling obama the most ignorant president in our history and one of the worst presidents in the history of our country one of the longstanding complaints about obama is that he has not summoned the energy and selflessness to improve the fortunes of the democratic party beyond him since his 2008 election the party has lost ground in the house in the senate and in statehouses across the country the democratic advantage in presidential elections is not matched by democratic dominance beyond the white house there d be a heaping measure of forgiveness for that if democrats won the presidency for a third straight term and it wouldn t be just any third term the nation s first black president would be handing over the reins to the nation s first woman president a sequence of milestones in perfect keeping with the democratic party s celebration of a more diverse inclusive america all of that clearly fueled obama on wednesday any past rivalry between him and clinton was history he made an even stronger case for her than the first lady or bill clinton had but the case he was really making was for america recalling that first convention speech of his in 2004 he said i was filled with faith faith in america the generous big hearted hopeful country that made my story that made all of our stories possible he added that despite war recession and other challenges that the country subsequently confronted i stand before you again tonight after almost two terms as your president to tell you that i am more optimistic about the future of america than ever before the america i know he said is full of courage and optimism and ingenuity the america i know is decent and generous that tack is in some ways inevitable and necessary it complements the democrats argument that obama has moved the country forward improving americans lives and that keeping the white house under democratic control with his handpicked successor is crucial but the way he delivered it it didn t seem to be a cold eyed strategy or a self serving bid for validation it came across as a cry from the heart and an earnest gorgeous one at that frank bruni is an op ed columnist for the times the editorial board in president obama and the long march philadelphia michael bloomberg clearly believes that donald trump is giving new york billionaires a bad name trump says he wants to run the nation like he s running his business god help us he snarled at the democratic convention bloomberg is not normally a particularly good public speaker but he was definitely on a roll wednesday night he laced into trump s well documented record of bankruptcies and thousands of lawsuits and angry stockholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel they ve been ripped off nothing crueler than a self made mogul lacing into an heir i built a business said the man who ranks no 8 on the forbes list of the richest people on the planet and i didn t start it with a million dollar check from my father ouch bloomberg began by cautioning democrats that he was not a part of their group and that he was there only to explain why i believe it is imperative that we elect hillary clinton as the next president of the united states which was really not much of a pill for the party to swallow what no shout out for the platform new york city s former mayor tends to follow his own star which is sort of an inherent right when you re worth around 48 billion in his speech he divided his time between savaging trump and pointing out that he was a registered independent because i don t believe that either party has a monopoly on good ideas or strong leadership all that was music to the ears of independent voter hungry democrats although if you live in new york city where almost all elections are effectively decided in democrats only primaries it is also a demand for disenfranchisement when it comes to convention speeches this was not bloomberg s first ballgame in 2004 he lured the republicans to new york putting up millions of his own money in the effort bloomberg was slated to give the welcoming address but george w bush s team objected to his prepared remarks which briefly criticized the way congress was divvying up post sept 11 aid his name was deleted from the speaker s list although at the last minute the warring parties came up with an agreement involving one deleted line there was no such problem this time the convention scrutinizers were presumably able to live with bloomberg s suggestion that democrats might be too tough on the private sector in return for having one of the wealthiest guys in the world announce that the richest thing about donald trump is his hypocrisy gail collins is an op ed columnist for the times how did president obama do in his speech i am on the floor of the democratic convention to get instant reaction given donald trump s thoroughly bizarre news conferences over the last few days during which he has invited russia to find hillary clinton s emails and reiterated his insinuation that ted cruz s father was friends with lee harvey oswald you might have expected his reddit ask me anything segment to be truly shocking you d be wrong mr trump was on strikingly good behavior during his a m a offering only token references to crooked hillary clinton lest redditors doubt it was really him to a libertarian debating whether to vote for a third party candidate or mr trump the republican nominee reddit username the realdonaldtrump replied americans in every party are tired of our rigged system and corrupt politicians and want to reform our government so it no longer benefits the powerful at the expense of everyone else they know i will fix it so it works for them and their families to a user who asked what role nasa should have in helping to make america great again mr trump said honestly i think nasa is wonderful america has always led the world in space exploration this is about as contentious as he got in response to a question about why mrs clinton doesn t do more news conferences crooked hillary clinton will not do press conferences because she cannot explain her illegally deleted 33 000 emails or her disaster in libya or her role pushing tpp which she would 100 percent approve if she got the chance or her support for a 550 percent increase in syrian refugees etc reddit is well known as a place where people speak without a filter the subreddit r the donald which hosted the a m a has become infamous since its creation last year jason koebler at motherboard described it as full of memes and in jokes far right talking points coded racism misogyny homophobia and islamophobia of course mr trump speaks without a filter on national television so maybe he felt no need to let loose on reddit maybe his staff did the whole a m a for him or maybe after a long day of telling the russians to hack american servers the realdonaldtrump was just a little tired anna north is a member of the editorial board is donald trump trying to convince everyone that he really is vladimir putin s puppet trump has often talked about russia in his wacky way saying he would be able to tame the russian bear because he s an expert at the art of the deal leon aron a russia expert with the american enterprise institute has a more realistic assessment putin will run circles around trump he said today but the trump putin story has become truly bizarre since wikileaks published thousands of emails belonging to the democratic national committee they certainly appear to have been hacked by russian code jockeys working for putin the hacking sparked conspiracy theories about whether trump is putin s chosen candidate or worse doing putin s political work for him the wikileaks founder julian assange has said he wants to hurt hillary clinton s campaign and would dole out hurtful documents on his own mysterious schedule at a news conference today at one of trump s golf courses in florida why does the self avowed friend of the ordinary american keep having events at exclusive golf clubs the republican nominee dug the russia hole deeper trump told reporters that he didn t know who hacked the d n c emails but referring to messages that were deleted from clinton s private email server he said russia if you re listening i hope you re able to find the 30 000 emails that are missing as incredible as it was to hear a presidential candidate seemingly urging an unfriendly foreign power to break into the emails of a former secretary of state trump didn t stop there i never met putin i don t know who putin is he said he said one nice thing about me he said i m a genius i said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it i never met putin the washington post helpfully pointed out in this annotated transcript of the trump news conference that putin never called trump a genius and trump has actually bragged about meeting putin when they both appeared on 60 minutes trump also told reporters today that he had zero financial connections to russia i have nothing to do with russia that s not true either in 2013 trump brought his miss universe pageant to russia and asked for a meeting with putin that was scheduled but later canceled trump did get a lacquered box from the russian strongman and made millions off the venture aras agalarov one of the oligarchs who made billions with the help of putin s corrupt and autocratic government said he had signed a deal to build a trump tower in russia so much for trump s lack of connection to russia and that doesn t even account for the longstanding and lucrative business connections of his campaign manager paul manafort with russian oligarchs and the ukrainian autocrat viktor yanukovych a kremlin puppet before he was deposed tucker carlson and harris faulkner two of trump s fox friends tried to defend his comments on the program outnumbered i thought he was saying we want the emails back carlson said julie roginsky a co host of the program tried to inject reality into the conversation that is not how anybody outside this table understands it she said david gregory a cnn political analyst called trump a child playing with matches that was well put gregory also said he had run out of words to express my shock and how completely beyond the pale that donald trump is as a potential leader of the free world maybe gregory has but trump had many more words to offer today to show how shockingly unfit he is to be president at one point in the news conference he said that if elected he would consider recognizing as legitimate russia s invasion of crimea the last time i checked crimea was part of a sovereign nation ukraine before putin seized it and american presidents don t encourage russian expansionism how far we ve come from ronald reagan going to berlin and demanding the kremlin tear down this wall andrew rosenthal is an op ed columnist for the times the comedian talked to the new york times s jim rutenberg from inside the mini oval office philadelphia we were in a hallway of the broad street ministry where a women s group was holding a forum for female activists when one of the event s organizers excitedly informed the crowd that danny glover would be making an appearance though he was stuck in traffic twenty minutes later mr glover appeared in the stairwell outside the meeting room flanked by two assistants he was wearing a baseball cap pulled low over his eyes and he looked tired but as promised he was here along with the thousands of delegates protesters journalists and onlookers that have descended on philadelphia this week a gaggle of celebrities have made appearances both inside and outside the convention hall compared with the democrats convention the star power at the republican national convention in cleveland last week registered at a much lower wattage celebrities in town for the festivities included stephen baldwin while his brother billy baldwin attended the democratic convention along with caitlyn jenner duck dynasty star willie robertson scott baio the soap opera actress kimberlin brown and the boxing promoter don king in the best jacket i saw all week the democrats on the other hand have already featured a slew of actresses including america ferrera meryl streep in an american flag patterned dress elizabeth banks eva longoria and lena dunham one small hiccup in the celebrity parade having the actor tony goldwyn who plays a president who cheats on his wife in the oval office speak in the run up to bill clinton s speech on tuesday night the democratic national convention maybe now just showing off how many hollywood connections it has released a star studded a cappella version of fight song the clinton campaign s unofficial theme song after hearing this song roughly 10 000 times on the campaign trail over the past year i find the song now gives me the political reporter s equivalent of an acid flashback but here it was once again this time with a video that included rachel platten who wrote the song mandy moore ester dean kristin chenoweth idina menzel elizabeth banks ren e fleming and bubbly young stars on monday night sarah silverman who supported mr sanders during the primary spoke on the convention stage with senator al franken after getting booed by some of mr sanders s most die hard supporters she looked exasperated to the bernie or bust people you re being ridiculous she said other celebrities who supported mr sanders didn t seem to have had a similar change of heart susan sarandon could be seen sitting sullenly watching the convention proceedings on monday she retweeted a message saying it looked as though she was having literally the worst time and added accurate elsewhere around town david schwimmer posed with delegates the nashville star connie britton did a photo op at a bounce house made to look like the white house kesha and the drive by truckers performed at a tuesday night party sponsored by the pro gun control group americans for responsible solutions on wednesday night the producer diplo is slated to be the d j at an after party hosted by the amalgam of pro clinton groups led by david brock across town rock the vote will be hosting its own event with the black eyed peas and the rapper ty dolla sign then on thursday the rapper snoop dogg is scheduled to perform at a unity concert sponsored by the pro clinton super pac priorities usa because nothing says party unity like gin and juice susan sarandon may have been having literally the worst time but everyone else is trying not to emma roller emmaroller a former reporter for national journal is a contributing opinion writer charles m blow writes in incandescent with rage philadelphia the republican convention last week included a number of gestures toward diversity the lineup featured some speakers and performers of color including pastor mark burns and the 6 year old singer heavenly joy jerkins in his invocation on the last night of the convention the rev steve bailey called for an end to racial discrimination we know that it s not right that racism continues to wound and destroy the lives of many in this land he said but now that the democratic convention is in full swing some stark contrasts have emerged while 1 182 of the 4 766 delegates in philadelphia this week are black according to collier meyerson at fusion only 18 of the 2 472 delegates in cleveland were in fact there were as many black speakers on monday night in philadelphia as there were black delegates on the floor at the republican convention and while tuesday night s roll call was marked by tension between hillary clinton and bernie sanders supporters hoisting dueling signs it was also a reminder of the diversity of the party representative ruben gallego of arizona introduced his state as the home state of cesar chavez home state of many native tribes home state of electing some of the first women leaders in this country jim obergefell one of the plaintiffs in the supreme court case that led to marriage equality for same sex couples spoke on behalf of ohio this ohio boy helped love win last summer and this ohio boy and my fellow ohioans know this love trumps hate and a south dakota state representative shawn bordeaux addressed the crowd in lakota before ann tornberg the state democratic party chairwoman announced that 15 of south dakota s votes would go to mrs clinton enough for her to clinch the nomination the democratic party has work to do when it comes to serving female minority and l g b t voters mrs clinton mr sanders and martin o malley all struggled at times to respond to the concerns of black lives matter protesters mrs clinton s campaign has been criticized for hispandering offering latino voters a list of ways mrs clinton is like their abuela rather than substantive policy discussions still the democratic convention so far has shown a commitment to real representation for female minority and l g b t americans something the republicans with their talk of building a wall banning muslims and rolling back marriage equality couldn t match anna north is a member of the editorial board when tim kaine accepts his party s nomination for vice president tonight i expect him to talk about his catholic faith his jesuit education the role that religion has played in inspiring him to a life of public service i don t expect him to acknowledge how the demands of party loyalty have erased any catholic distinctiveness in his politics any evidence that faith should trump partisanship when the two actively conflict the erosion of catholic distinctiveness is a long running story in american politics the church s social doctrine stresses both economic solidarity and social conservatism calling catholic politicians to either a pro life pro family liberalism or to a one nation conservatism neither racist nor ayn randian but as our politics have polarized with a similar polarization in post vatican ii catholicism of course these combinations have become intensely difficult to maintain its last moment in the sun was arguably the george w bush era when compassionate conservatism tried to draw on catholic ideas about fighting poverty and democrats responded to their 2004 defeat by increasing religious outreach and recruiting more socially conservative candidates tim kaine was one of those candidates running for governor of virginia in 2005 he offered a version of mario cuomo s personally opposed but maneuver on abortion but he also played up his support for a partial birth abortion ban parental notification laws and informed consent provisions designed to persuade women to carry pregnancies to term this earned him the enduring suspicion of abortion rights activists but after ascending to the senate in 2012 he never did anything to justify that suspicion while describing himself as personally pro life he compiled a lock step 100 percent naral rated voting record meanwhile his party moved in a more pro abortion direction dropping its bill clinton era rhetoric about making the procedure rare and amending its platform to call for the repeal of the hyde amendment which bars public funding for abortion and now kaine has moved with them less than a month ago he described himself as traditionally a supporter of the hyde amendment but since joining hillary clinton s ticket he s reportedly reversed that position sweeping away the last trace of actual pro life policy from his repertoire of views what remains isn t a distinctively catholic liberalism or a pope francis catholicism as some credulous observers have suggested it s just a liberalism that likes its usual agenda read in the light that comes in through stained glass of course kaine s surrender to party orthodoxy isn t the only catholic surrender happening this year on the republican side prominent catholic politicians like paul ryan and marco rubio spent several years trying to walk their party s rhetoric back from its un catholic makers vs takers 47 percent turn and making limited but promising attempts to bring economic solidarity back into the g o p policy agenda and then came donald trump inviting republicans to embrace a more authoritarian form of solidarity unmoored from any real social conservatism and united by white identity politics rather than a vision of the common good which to their credit both ryan and rubio resisted but only up to a point because in the end partisanship trumped catholic principle mormon principle it s worth noting seems to be made of sterner stuff so this is the catholic politics we have in the america of 2016 catholic liberals who endorse unlimited abortion and catholic conservatives who endorse an authoritarian buffoon jesus wept ross douthat is an op ed columnist for the times an earlier version of this post misstated the dates that tim kaine ran for governor of virginia and was elected to the senate he ran for governor in 2005 not 2006 and was elected to the senate in 2012 not 2010 ever since americans elected their first african american president the not so hidden racism on the right has steadily slithered its way into the open enabled most recently by donald trump s undisguised bigotry but bill o reilly brought this trend to a new low on tuesday with his deranged comments about michelle obama s convention speech in which she talked about living in a house the white house that was built by slaves o reilly who presents himself as a historian pretended to be praising and expanding on the first lady s observation the history behind her remarks is fascinating he said on his fox news program slaves that worked there were well fed and had decent lodgings provided by the government which stopped hiring slave labor in 1802 he said however the feds did not forbid subcontractors from using slave labor and so o reilly continued michelle obama is essentially correct in citing slaves as builders of the white house but there were others working as well she was not essentially right she was completely right i m sure the fact that non slaves also worked on the white house would come as a great relief to the descendants of those unfortunate humans whose tormenters forced them to help build the official residence of the president of the united states let s be clear the federal government never hired slaves it paid their enslaver for their work and the fact that it did not forbid contractors from using slaves was a direct endorsement of slavery worst of all o reilly was mouthing classic racist propaganda when he waxed rhapsodic about the slaves having three hots and a cot it took me about five seconds on google to find more examples of this argument than i can list here in 2012 in fact salon published a non exhaustive list of 10 racists who made the same claim including representative jon hubbard of arkansas hubbard wrote in a 2009 book that the slavery that the black race has long believed to be an abomination upon its people may actually have been a blessing in disguise pat buchanan another bigot who once ran for president wrote and the list goes on in his film 2016 obama s america the right winger dinesh d souza actually argues that while frederick douglass exposed the indescribable evil of slavery he did after all stay in america that s a particularly twisted version of the america love it or leave it argument of times past it is especially sickening to see this kind of filth on an american news network even one as slanted as fox news whose on air ideologues claim to champion individual liberties on the eve of president obama s speech at the philadelphia convention the network which recently ousted its creater roger ailes because of sexual harassment allegations owes the country an apology slavery was a hideous crime committed against our fellow americans black americans were hunted tortured beaten and murdered by white americans with impunity well into the second half of the 20th century there is no excusing or explaining away slavery just as there is no excusing o reilly s remarks at the very least he personally owes us all an apology andrew rosenthal is an op ed columnist for the times philadelphia stephen starr owned and operated a bunch of this city s most popular restaurants when the republicans had their convention here in 2000 he owns and operates an even bigger bunch of those restaurants now and over the years plenty of prominent republicans and democrats have visited his upscale dining rooms giving him a window into partisan grazing habits and a belief that they differ slightly but only slightly and in a way that s not exactly going to shock you republicans don t eat much sushi he told me definitely democrats consume more sushi it was dinnertime on tuesday and the convention was nearing its midpoint starr seemed disappointed although he s both a democrat and an admirer of hillary clinton s he wasn t sensing as much excitement in the city as he did back in 2000 when the republicans were nominating george w bush but the difference he said wasn t about the candidates or even really the political parties it was about the national mood before the terrorist attacks of sept 11 and then the economic downturn of 2008 he said there was a much bigger appetite for splashy events in stylish restaurants like his asian fusion fun house buddakan and his japanese fantasia morimoto now the events are more restrained we re still waiting for splashy to come back starr told me among his 19 restaurants here the one that s proving to be the most desirable this week during the democratic convention isn t buddakan or morimoto or barclay prime the sumptuous steakhouse in which he and i talked a mouthwatering and quickly disappearing new york strip steak between us it s talula s garden his less showy farm to table restaurant in other words the eat your peas political party is having dinner parties with vegetable heavy menus there s a missing spark starr said at a party for the funny or die humor website and production company in his restaurant buddakan on monday night there were two prominent schumers on the guest list he said chuck the senator and amy the tv and movie star to the best of his knowledge only chuck made an appearance starr told me with something of a sigh he perked up just minutes later though when he received word that at his restaurant parc a french brasserie next door to barclay prime elizabeth warren and a few companions had just sat down their shared order included a green salad clams on the half shell escargots and halibut i learned later the same night bernie sanders dined in a party of 10 at butcher and singer another of starr s restaurants he ate roast chicken starr informed me and the side dishes on the table included creamed spinach french fries and asparagus reflecting on the conventions that have come through philadelphia starr said that the dining differences between political parties and between professional groups are relatively subtle though he has noticed a lawyers doctors divide lawyers drink more and order more expensive items for sure he said jeff benjamin the chief operating officer of the vetri family restaurant group here told me that democrats were being more adventurous than republicans had been in 2000 but republicans had fewer restaurants to sample and americans in general didn t obsess as much over where to eat back then he said a person or group would dine at the same place multiple times he recalled that the former senator don nickles an oklahoma republican ate dinner at the restaurant vetri on three nights in four days no one s doing that this time around benjamin said he said that to get ready for this week he reached out to cleveland restaurateurs who reported that many republican delegates were leaving the convention hall during dinner hours to slip into restaurants for meals democratic delegates haven t been doing likewise he said they re staying put keeping the arena s seats full i also checked in with the philadelphia restaurateur mike solomonov whom i ve written about before and whose nationally acclaimed restaurant zahav is one of the hottest dining tickets in town this week he didn t have any major sightings to report but said he s been privately hoping to get sudden notice that president obama was dropping by he remains prepared although he has a limited daily supply of one of his signature entrees lamb shoulder roasted with pomegranate juice he has been keeping a half shoulder for four in reserve every night just in case we have an obama lamb he told me barack obama or jesus christ we have lamb for those two frank bruni is an op ed columnist for the times share your thoughts as we draw a map of your opinions across america today as she did on monday and tuesday laura carleton will pick her kids up from day camp in south philadelphia and they will pull their wagon to the democratic national convention to sell lemonade the children nicco 12 andreas 9 and simone 6 are raising money to buy school supplies for children in a homeless shelter where ms carleton used to work and to honor the memory of their friend nafice hill ms carleton is an english teacher two decades ago she worked as a tutor at the drueding center a shelter for homeless families in north philadelphia that s where she met the hill family nafice was about 7 years old then living in the shelter with two siblings and his grandmother lorraine in time ms hill found a home earned a degree and now works as an addiction counselor about a decade ago a young man stopped ms carleton on the street saying ms laura it was nafice grown and working as a math tutor for kids not far from where ms carleton had once taught him they remained in sporadic touch until january 12 when lorraine hill called with the terrible news that nafice was dead he was robbed and shot to death in that same north philly neighborhood where he had tutored children it felt like losing one of my own children ms carleton said he was one where i thought he s going to do so well so on day 1 of the d n c the carletons made a poster with a photo of kids from the shelter and the go fund me page for their school supplies drive for nafice they covered the poster in plastic so it wouldn t get wet from the lemonade and loaded up their wagon but as the carleton kids pulled their jug of lemonade down broad street displaying their poster and trying to tell their story impatient delegates and shouting demonstrators kept passing them by the police posted on the street corners listened most of the 25 the carletons earned monday and tuesday came from them even though the family told them they didn t have to pay as the convention roll call vote on tuesday confirmed hillary clinton as the nation s first female democratic presidential nominee the carletons texted me this photo of them at the corner of broad and shunk streets they included a message for whoever becomes our next president don t forget the nafices everyone talks about the middle class few discuss the poor the people struggling day to day elizabeth williamson is a member of the editorial board an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of three children raising money for a homeless shelter it is carleton as the article notes not carlteton bryce covert in hillary clinton s radical promise barack obama made his debut on the national scene at the democratic convention 12 years ago and he almost certainly wouldn t be president now without the speech he gave that night tonight obama returns to the convention to give the first of what no doubt will be several valedictories about his presidency he will obviously focus on the future and in particular on why a hillary clinton presidency would be good for the country but he has no choice but to talk about the past as well clinton has cast herself as obama s heir and obama will need to make a case that his presidency has been a success it s a tricky task but i think two common poll questions point to obama s area of opportunity on the one hand americans remain deeply unhappy with the state of the country almost 70 percent say it is on the wrong track while only about 25 percent say it s on the right track it has hovered in that grim range for obama s entire presidency historically americans blame or credit the incumbent president for the state of the country but something seems to have changed in recent years with much of the republican party deeply and publicly committed to obama s failure many voters have come to understand that he isn t omnipotent since the start of the year more americans have approved of his performance than disapproved of it a significant chunk of americans in other words think the country is struggling but that it would be doing even worse without the democrats policies on some level many americans understand that obama inherited a mess and believe he has cleaned up at least parts of it that s a big reason that clinton has made the strategic decision to link herself to obama his biggest task tonight to my mind is telling a clear story that makes sense of this complicated picture and connects it to the election it is a story about the progress the country has made on his watch wages that at long last are increasing an unemployment rate below 5 percent rising numbers of high school and college graduates health care available to more people climate policies that are starting to make a difference but it also needs to be a story that acknowledges the country s enduring problems perhaps above all it should be a story about why clinton can plausibly claim she will succeed where he did not the most effective speech that obama could give would not simply try to transfer his popularity to her the most effective version would try to distinguish clinton from obama and lift her above him in some ways no one has a better chance to do so than he does david axelrod obama s longtime campaign guru likes to say that voters don t want to elect a president too similar to the previous president rarely do voters look for a replica axelrod wrote to obama 10 years ago as he was pondering a run instead they generally choose a course correction selecting a candidate who will address the deficiencies of the outgoing president the combination of obama s speech tonight and clinton s tomorrow s should begin to grapple with that reality david leonhardt who will begin an op ed column later this year is writing a daily opinion post during the conventions bill clinton in an interview with maureen dowd in 1992 climate change the greatest environmental crisis facing our planet as bernie sanders said monday has been a recurring theme so far at the democratic national convention it was all but missing at the republican convention despite the atmosphere of doom and gloom except that is in the party s platform which dismissed the dangers we face as our planet warms because of greenhouse gas pollution the party platform rejects the paris climate accord agreed to last year by 195 nations to fight climate change the democratic platform by contrast asserts we believe the united states must lead in forging a robust global solution to the climate crisis it s not just that republicans don t want to act on climate change republican leaders say they don t even believe in it mr trump has called climate change a hoax mike pence the party s nominee for vice president has said i don t know that that is a resolved issue in science today a claim that has been rejected by virtually every major scientific society in america clearly mr trump and mr pence have access to this information so why do they reject it the answer is what sociologists call implicatory denial if one takes climate change seriously it almost inevitably leads to considering the role of government in addressing it climate change from greenhouse gas pollution is a form of market failure what economists call an external cost that s why many conservatives support the idea of putting a price on carbon markets don t always work the way we want them to and governments sometimes have to act to remedy market failure this is something that academic economists consider uncontroversial the hard edge right however has taken the position that government is the problem this leaves those republicans unable to accept that government actually is the solution to climate change or at least part of the solution but this denial of settled science doesn t just concern the climate consider vaccines remember the measles outbreak last year at disneyland this outbreak and others were completely preventable because measles vaccines are safe inexpensive and effective now imagine that a new president encourages americans not to get vaccinated because he thinks the science is unsettled and maybe vaccines actually do cause autism millions of americans decide not to get their children vaccinated or at least delay doing so the result would be a public health crisis this is no dystopian fantasy mr trump has suggested that vaccines cause autism and that parents might want to delay getting their children vaccinated mr pence has said that smoking doesn t kill the rejection of science starts with ideology it ends with people dying naomi oreskes is a professor of the history of science at harvard and the author with erik m
