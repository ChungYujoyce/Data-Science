scott pelley reports the new developments in the impeachment inquiry into president trump and speaks with voters and two members of congress from both sides of the aisle who say the inquiry is necessary today lawyers representing the whistleblower who ignited the impeachment inquiry say there is a second whistleblower now who is familiar with the phone call between president trump and volodymyr zelensky the president of ukraine that phone call came to light two weeks ago after a u s intelligence officer filed an official complaint alleging mr trump solicited a foreign government to help his 2020 campaign late friday the white house received its first congressional subpoena for records also last week members of congress went home to hear from their constituents we travelled with two members who are now facing some of the most consequential decisions of their careers their congressional districts are 1 700 miles and worlds apart new jersey s 11th congressional district is white suburban and wealthy texas 23rd congressional district is wide open and 70 latino the texas district is represented by a republican will hurd will hurd now these are allegations that the whistleblower brought up and we should be trying to understand what is true and what isn t the representative for new jersey s 11th district is a democrat mikie sherrill scott pelley many americans are saying we just went through two years of this with the mueller report and now we re gonna do this again mikie sherrill i think what i m asking for from the american people is faith faith in our democratic values faith that we can do this relatively quickly and get to the bottom of this and protect our democracy there was no bottom last week to the cascading events thursday the president s former point man on ukraine ambassador kurt volker provided text messages to congress among them was a text volker sent to his counterpart on president zelensky s staff in preparation for the phone call heard from white house volker wrote assuming president z convinces trump he will investigate get to the bottom of what happened in 2016 we will nail down date for a visit to washington this suggested zelensky would be invited to the oval office if he agreed to investigate a rumor that ukrainians helped democrats in 2016 and were hiding a democratic email server there is no known evidence of this last wednesday mr trump doubled down on what he said in the call president donald trump believe it or not i watch my words very carefully there are those that think i m a very stable genius okay i watch my words very very closely the call with zelensky came in july days after mr trump suspended military sales to ukraine which is fighting rebels backed by russia in the official record president zelensky asked for javelin anti tank missiles president trump replied i would like you to do us a favor though that s when he asked zelensky to investigate the rumor about 2016 scott pelley what do you make of that will hurd i wouldn t have handled the conversation that way republican will hurd is on the committee leading the investigation will hurd it is behavior that i wouldn t have done scott pelley is it improper will hurd is it an impeachable offense i don t think so but that in concert with some of the allegations made by the whistleblower is why i think we should understand what actually happened and the lead up to that phone call in my opinion is more is more important to understand motivations and intentions by all the actors involved new jersey democrat mikie sherrill is a former navy pilot federal prosecutor and military advisor on russia she opposed previous calls for an impeachment inquiry until the phone call scott pelley president zelensky says we are almost ready to buy more javelins from the united states for defense purposes and president trump s immediate response is i d like you to do us a favor though mikie sherrill this is what s so critical those javelins are pretty much what stands between western europe and russian tank forces to put that security aid at risk because he wants to not fulfill the duties of the president of the united states of america but to instead serve his own personal self interest that again was the bright line representative sherrill s new jersey district lies across the hudson from manhattan last november she became the first democrat to win the seat in 34 years over coffee we heard from her constituents republican karen arakelian democrat brett wellman and kathy abbott who was a republican member of a town council kathy abbott well i do think that a line was crossed now he s meddling in foreign policy without understanding policy and understanding that you cannot involve foreign governments in your reelection campaign scott pelley you ve been a republican how long kathy abbott about 25 years karen arakelian i disagree i think this is something that has been being asked for since the day the man was elected and they re just waiting and trying to find something making many big things out of nothing and this is another one and i think the truth will come out and i m kinda glad that they re doing it because what we heard of the conversation is basically a conversation between two leaders of countries and they want to get to the bottom of what happened brett wellman private conversations and leveraging the office of the presidency of the united states and federal funds are two very different things karen arakelian is that what you think happened brett wellman yes karen arakelian i don t think that s what happened at all scott pelley what would you say to someone who says look we re 13 months away from the election let the voters decide mikie sherrill when we are seeing the president already taking steps to undermine the 2020 elections i m not sure we have that luxury will hurd s district stretches from san antonio to el paso hurd is the only black republican in the house a former cia officer in afghanistan and pakistan scott pelley anybody talking to you about impeachment will hurd no when you look at the calls or the emails that we get into the office from constituents it s no different gun violence is still an issue in my district and still we have a crisis going on along our border in san antonio we brought up impeachment with democrats jennifer falcon and trish mendoza and republicans andres holliday and stephen pennington jennifer falcon i think we should have done it a long time ago trump has incited violence and is a misogynist and has really fueled the fire of racism in america scott pelley andres what do you see in the phone call andres holliday i see something that most likely happens on a day to day basis with leaders of nations i mean all the time there s going to be conversations of how can we work together on things trish mendoza i read the transcripts like probably all of us have like a lot of people have and what i read was sounded like our president pressuring the head of a foreign government to do him a favor a political favor stephen pennington we ll have to see what comes out because i don t see anything that would rise to high crimes and misdemeanors an impeachable offense i just don t see it president donald trump and biden is not the brightest person all week mr trump worked to shift attention to his reelection rival former vice president joe biden president donald trump if biden is corrupt if his son is corrupt when his son takes out billions of dollars billions when they do that that s no good biden is the focus of a conspiracy theory for which no evidence has been publicly produced in the obama white house biden worked with the european union to force out a ukrainian prosecutor who was considered weak on corruption at the time biden s son was on the board of a ukrainian gas company that had been investigated but not charged there is the appearance of a conflict of interest but ukraine says neither biden was suspected of anything illegal still mr trump s lawyer rudy giuliani pushed a theory that biden must have forced the prosecutor out to protect his son from something on the call with zelensky mr trump says the other thing there s a lot of talk about biden s son that biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great mr trump was offering u s attorney general william barr to help in a foreign government investigating one of his reelection opponents barr denies being involved president donald trump china should start an investigation into the bidens because what happened in china is just about as bad as what happened with uh with ukraine mr trump s surprising request to china last week for no stated reason was an example of the president of the united states hurling indictments without facts in a news conference with finland s president reuters reporter jeff mason asked mr trump what he wanted zelensky to do in regard to the bidens president donald trump look biden and his son are stone cold crooked and you know it his son walks out with millions of dollars the kid knows nothing you know it and so do we go ahead ask a question now jeff mason the question sir was what did you want president zelensky to do about vice president biden and his son hunter president donald trump are you talking to me jeff mason it was a just a follow up of what i just asked you sir president donald trump listen listen are you ready we have the president of finland ask him a question jeff mason i have one for him i just wanted to follow up on the one that i asked you which was president donald trump did you hear me jeff mason what did you want him to president donald trump did you hear me jeff mason yes sir president donald trump ask him a question jeff mason i will but president donald trump i ve given you a long answer ask this gentleman a question don t be rude jeff mason no sir i don t want to be rude i just wanted you to have a chance to answer the question that i asked you president donald trump i ve answered everything it s a whole hoax and you know who s playing into the hoax people like you and the fake news media that we have in this country and i say in many cases the corrupt media because you re corrupt among those text messages given to congress one seemed to clear the president s motives the senior u s diplomat in ukraine complained i think it s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign the u s ambassador to the european union replied the president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo s of any kind but that message was written days after the ukraine story had broken in public a cbs news poll shows 55 of voters support the investigation our restaurant poll found 100 agreement on how the political parties should proceed scott pelley you all believe that this should be top priority in washington today and that the other things should wait brett wellman absolutely kathy abbott unfortunately yes karen arakelian let s get it done now at this point it s happening let s do it as quickly as possible cause there s a lot of really important issues that have to be addressed scott pelley these last two weeks have been pretty tough and i wonder if any of you think that the rhetoric is already way too overheated trish mendoza i think it s been overheated for a while the temperature needs to be cooled down significantly so that people who are just regular citizens voters like ourselves can come together and actually have conversations about the way forward andres holliday i could i could not agree with that that more i think that trish mendoza well there you go there are not likely to be handshakes across the aisle of the house as the question of impeachment dominates the foreseeable future mikie sherrill now that we ve done it i think we need to really make sure we re conveying to the american people how seriously we take this how sober this is this is not a happy time for us will hurd there are many people that look at the whistleblower complaint as an example of why there should be impeachment and the other side wants to look at this as exoneration of what the administration is doing what i want to do is understand the truth produced by nicole
