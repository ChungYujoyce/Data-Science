states and d c filed a briefingwith the u s supreme court to defend the affordable care act cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall wicesays this comes after the high court agreed to review an appeals court decision that found the health care law s individual mandate unconstitutional and called into the question whether the law could stand as a whole the case originated with a texas led effort backed by the trump administration now as both parties move forward with filings in the supreme court democrats are sounding the alarm on what has been one of their main talking points during the 2018 midterms and continues to be in the 2020 election protecting the affordable care act by siding with the republican attorneys general who are seeking to invalidate the aca in the u s supreme court trump has made clear where his priorities lie not with protecting the millions of people who depend on the exchanges for their health coverage not with ensuring that more than 100 million people with pre existing conditions won t be denied coverage or charged more by their insurers not with the thousands of americans who may develop new pre existing conditions due to their battle with covid 19 not with the young people who can now stay on their parents insurance until 26 not with women who will no longer be protected against being charged more for their insurance presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden said in a statement no trump has decided he d rather destroy president obama s legacy than protect the health care of millions upon millions of americans biden said his statement was one of many released by democratic party officials lawmakers and state leaders as the case moves forward meanwhile president trump reiterated support for the republican led effort today we re not doing anything we re staying in other words we re staying with the group with texas and the group he said in the oval office obamacare is a disaster but we ve run it very well and we ve made it barely acceptable he added in 2017 republican efforts to repeal obamacare failed in congress president trump has said on several occasions since that republicans would unveil their own health care plan but it has not yet materialized now as the coronavirus strains health care systems across the country some question whether the entire system needs to be examined including progressives who ve long pushed for medicare for all from the candidates joe biden on thursday biden is taking his presidential campaign to florida reportscbs news political correspondent ed o keefe well kind of he s making virtual stops in jacksonville and tampa where he plans to hold discussions with local leaders and a rally respectively the two events are a first for the biden campaign as they begin targeting specific swing states ahead of november s election recent polls give biden a single digit edge over president trump in florida and the stops or whatever we re calling them are designed to shore up support in two corners of the state where a democratic presidential candidate can do well jacksonville which has a large african american population and tampa which sits at the western edge of the famed i 4 corridor that white house campaigns always target in pursuit of swing voters so what will make these stops distinctly florida even though biden will be beaming in from delaware expect a slate of local leaders or political figures to appear before biden speaks and there may be some florida specific items in biden s graphics or backdrop said the aides who weren t authorized to speak publicly about the matter the events are also the first glimpse at biden s florida operations which have yet to be tested in a big way staffers and volunteers are calling texting and emailing potential supporters urging them to tune into the two events and aides said the campaign is also spending some money to advertise the event and we should expect that biden will also be conducting local television interviews late last night biden commented on the killing of 25 year old ahmaud arbery whose death wascaptured on video cbs news campaign reporter bo ericksonreports ontwitter biden called for an investigation into arbery s death noting it was clear that he was killed in cold blood on wednesday biden was endorsed by the human rights campaign saying his dedication

struggle to pay for food and the technological gap for some students to e learn without the adequate resources dr biden said we are seeing that these biases these injustices they are deadly it should make us all angry president trump president trump announced today in the oval office that his administration will be keeping the coronavirus task force in place indefinitely following concerns raised over reports of the group s winding down mr trump told reporters i had no idea how popular the task force is until actually yesterday when i started talking about winding it down i d get calls from

ahead of the 2020 election including former vice president joe biden 16 current senators and challengers running for the senate and 84 house candidates the grassroots funded political action committee toldcbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall wiceits bottom line is to get democrats to the polls we want to win a majority and we want to take back the white house so we prioritized the white house we prioritized winning back the senate and retaining the majority in the house said executive director alex morgan morgan told cbs news the pac is focusing on battleground races where it can make the most difference but because access to the ballot is core to its mission the group is also concentrating on a slate of candidates who support legislation focused on voting access like the for the people act and the voting rights advancement act having someone at the top of the ticket being outspoken about those issues is really crucial morgan said of biden as part of its mission to get people to the polls ptp is investing more than 52 million to knock on more than 10 million doors and get out the vote in 17 presidential and senate battleground states and despite the coronavirus has people homebound for now that plan has not changed the organization already hired all of its district leadership positions in february including about 115 people who would be opening offices and training staff in 17 states it s opening offices buying supplies and setting up the technology needed by its teams at the same time all trainings are being conducted via zoom while there are still questions about when people will be heading out and knocking on doors ptp is talking about ordering face masks and hand sanitizer we re talking about pre packaging morgan said normally we would hand someone a clipboard we are not going to do that this cycle because we don t want to exchange things back and forth morgan emphasized the group is also keeping a close eye on stay at home orders and will not be going door to door until it gets the local go ahead in addition the group has launched an effort called turnout 2020 which is a virtual phone banking program through that program millions of supporters on their email list who were going to travel to engage with voters could still volunteer some staff have also shifted their attention to making calls to battleground states like pennsylvania wisconsin and arizona to remind voters that they can sign up to vote by mail online in november we ve been calling voters and walking them through that process said morgan you know while everybody is at home to say hey this is a really good action you can take right now to ensure you get a ballot and can cast your vote this november regardless of what happens issues that matter gun control while the pandemic has transformed and curbed the fundraising scene dramatically the brady pac a sister organization of the brady gun control advocacy group has actually seen an increase in fundraising and interest brian lemek executive director of brady pac toldcbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarrobrady pac has raised 1 million so far in the year and based off the activity in the past two months has doubled its election cycle fundraising goal to 5 million lemek said there are two factors mainly spurring grassroots support the images of some state capitol protesters bringing their assault style weapons and the type of panic purchasing of firearms in states where gun shops have been deemed essential to the brady pac the panic purchasing at gun shops highlights the issue of improper use and storage of weapons in the home they re introducing this element to their home and because they re new gun owners and because perhaps they aren t able to go to the range for practice or get more familiar with the weapon it s being mishandled and it could be used to harm those in their homes he said like many groups and campaigns lemek said at the onset of the pandemic the group was preparing to batten down the hatches in anticipation of a downturn in fundraising we never for a moment thought that that covid would tie back to guns but the collective movement is outraged it s brought this attention we never imagined that we would have with it being a virus to the issue and the grassroots network has been incredibly responsive he said with its funds the group is looking to help boost both incumbents and candidates on tuesday it endorsed one house democrat challenger 11 house democrat incumbent frontliners and two senate candidates barbara bollier in kansas and theresa greenfield in iowa state by state michigan republican legislative leaders in michiganannounceda lawsuit challenging democratic governor gretchen whitmer s emergency powers after she extended michigan s state of emergency through may 28th last week according tocbs news campaign reporters jack turmanandadam brewster the lawsuit which was filed in the michigan court of claims argues that whitmer has violated the separation of powers in her handling of the covid 19 pandemic she has chosen to regulate every aspect of nearly 10 million lives with no consent or input from the people s representatives whose assistance the governor publicly disdains the court filing says republicans are challenging whitmer s executive authority under an emergency powers law from 1945 and the emergency management act of 1976 the 1945 law does not mention that a governor needs legislative approval to issue reasonable orders but republicans are arguing that the law does not pertain to statewide pandemics but instead applies only to geographically limited civil disturbance like emergencies the emergency management act of 1976 does note an extension to a state of emergency requires legislative approval because the legislature did not extend the state of emergency at the end of april republican legislators argue that whitmer does not have emergency powers under the 1976 law whitmer has cited both laws for giving her the ability to enact a state of emergency and issue executive orders related to covid 19 tiffany brown a spokesperson for whitmer said that whitmer will not be distracted by this lawsuit and will continue to make decisions based on data and guidance from medical experts this lawsuit is just another partisan game that won t distract the governor brown said in a statement her number one priority is saving lives she s making decisions based on science and data not political or legal pressure new york a federal judge restored the new york democratic presidential primary ruling tuesday that its cancellation by the new york state board of elections last month was unconstitutional cbs news campaign reporter nicole sgangaandpolitical unit associate producer eleanor watsonreportthe order from u s district judge analisa torres returns all qualifying presidential candidates including vermont senator bernie sanders to the primary ballot and mandates that the election must take place june 23 as previously scheduled last month new york state the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic took the unprecedented step of canceling its presidential primary citing coronavirus concerns tuesday s opinion followed a legal challenge filed by former democratic presidential candidate andrew yang and a group of delegates aiming to reverse the cancellation lawyers for sanders and yang presented arguments in manhattan monday if all but one of the presidential candidates are removed from the ballot and the primary is not held delegate plaintiffs will be deprived of the opportunity to compete for delegate slots and shape the course of events at the convention and voters will lose the chance to express their support for delegates who share their views judge torres wrote in her ruling adding the loss of these first amendment rights is a heavy hardship the new york board of elections originally voted to remove candidates who have suspended their campaigns from the primary ballot under an obscure provision entered into the state budget signed by governor andrew cuomo in april that decision said joe biden the presumptive democratic nominee would receive all the 274 pledged delegates that is no longer the case the rules and bylaws committee of the democratic national committee is meeting on may 12 to discuss what to do with delegates of states who have moved their primaries past the designated window in the party s rules according to the rules states must hold primaries by june 9 and all delegates must be elected by june 20 while states may request a waiver it must be ultimately approved by the rules and bylaws committee ohio a little over a week after ohio s vote by mail primary concluded ohio secretary of state frank larose is proposing voting reforms ahead of future elections in a fact sheet from the secretary of state s office some of the reforms include allowing voters to request an absentee ballot online providing pre paid postage envelopes in order for voters to mail in their ballots and moving the absentee ballot request deadline to the tuesday before election day the current deadline to request a vote by mail ballot is three days before election day which creates a likelihood that voters will not receive their ballot on time according to the fact sheet aaron ockerman the executive director of the ohio association of election officials a bipartisan organization that represents the county boards of elections and their employees toldcbs news campaign reporter jack turmanthat the association is supportive of larose s proposals ockerman added that the reforms are common sense and he hopes the reforms will be seriously considered by ohio s legislature before the legislature recesses for the
