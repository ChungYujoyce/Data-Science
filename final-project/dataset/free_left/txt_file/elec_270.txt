advertisement supported by transcript na by sheryl gay stolberg columbus ohio gov john r kasich a voluble and blunt talking maverick who is hoping his upbeat vision for a united america can catapult him to the white house declared tuesday that he is running for president telling a crowd here that he has the experience and the testing the testing which shapes you and prepares you for the most important job in the world mr kasich joined by his wife and 15 year old twin daughters addressed several thousand cheering supporters inside the student union building at ohio state university here offering a centrist appeal designed to paint him as a common sense midwesterner who can fix a broken washington he avoided attacking president obama as his republican rivals have done the event was a return of sorts as an 18 year old ohio state freshman in 1970 mr kasich wrote president richard m nixon to plead successfully to visit the white house but mr kasich seemed determined to link himself to another republican president the conservative hero ronald reagan whose optimistic oratory he sought to evoke the sun is rising and the sun is going to rise to the zenith in america again mr kasich said at one point recounting his advice to citizens of an ohio community whose economy was devastated by job losses during the recession he wrapped up his speech with another reagan esque declaration the light of a city on a hill cannot be hidden america is that city and you are that light mr kasich 63 became the 16th prominent republican to enter the 2016 field as a two term governor in a critical swing state no candidate since john f kennedy in 1960 has won the white house without winning ohio he is a credible candidate though his late entry means he has catch up work to do he is also an unconventional one mr kasich s expansion of medicaid under the affordable care act and his aversion to the culture wars present considerable obstacles in winning over more ideological voters his 43 minute sometimes meandering speech delivered with notes but no script and no teleprompter was classic kasich it was gritty and at times defiant they said it couldn t be done we proved them wrong he said recounting naysayers he has met along the way and it was laden with his faith inspired if idiosyncratic pearls of life wisdom the dog ate my homework went out in the fifth grade mr kasich said at one point talking about personal responsibility describing a holocaust memorial on the grounds of the ohio statehouse he said there s this line etched in it that says if you ve saved one life you ve saved the world do you believe that later he described himself as a flawed man trying to honor god s blessings in my life mr kasich also spoke of two wonderful african american fellows he met at a wendy s restaurant who he said urged him to run mr kasich won a quarter of the black vote when he won re election in 2014 he told them that other candidates would have more money and they looked at me he said and said but you ve got statistics in ignoring mr obama the governor may have missed an opportunity to gin up enthusiasm on the republican right a constituency that is already suspicious of him because of some of his moderate policy positions including his expansion of medicaid under the affordable care act this is about the future and bringing people together john weaver mr kasich s chief strategist said after the speech when asked about the omission barack obama is not on the ballot the son of a postman from working class mckees rocks pa mr kasich won his first election to the ohio senate when he was 24 at 30 in 1982 he won a seat in congress becoming the only nonincumbent republican that year to defeat an incumbent democrat he went on to lead the house budget committee and led a successful effort to balance the federal budget when bill clinton was president an achievement he is seeking to spotlight in his campaign he is also highlighting his national security credentials he spent 18 years on the house armed services committee and what he calls his ohio story of jobs and economic recovery as governor boasting of the 2 billion surplus his state has amassed on his watch we are going to take the lessons of the heartland he said here tuesday and straighten out washington d c but first voters must figure out who mr kasich is the governor is not nearly as well known as other candidates polls show about 2 percent of republicans back him a critical early test for mr kasich analysts say will be whether he can raise those numbers enough to land a spot in the aug 6 republican debate in cleveland in his own backyard but it may be too late only the top 10 candidates in polling will make the cut the first debate to me is the first primary said matthew dowd the chief strategist for george w bush s 2004 re election campaign he views mr kasich along with gov scott walker of wisconsin jeb bush the former florida governor and senator marco rubio of florida as the candidates who have a real legitimate shot at winning the nomination the republican party has 16 major presidential candidates this cycle three times the number of democrats and more than any other field in recent history but mr dowd said he needs to get on that stage kasich aides say they are not nearly as concerned with the debate as they are with the actual first primary in february in new hampshire where independent minded republicans like the ohio governor and senator john mccain of arizona some of whose former advisers including mr weaver now work for mr kasich have traditionally fared well leading the kasich effort in new hampshire is john e sununu the former senator who warmed up the crowd on tuesday by reminding it of mr kasich s work in washington he helped us achieve things that we honestly did not think we had in us mr sununu said after his speech mr kasich headed to new hampshire for several days of town hall style meetings he will also make stops later in the week in south carolina iowa and michigan the political action committee supporting his election new day for america has already spent more than 2 million on television advertising in the boston market which reaches into new hampshire where a new ad began running on tuesday like mr mccain mr kasich is brusque and often combative even his own aides describe him euphemistically as impatient and questions about his temperament have dogged him throughout his career is john kasich too big a jerk to be president a cleveland newspaper columnist asked this month but here in columbus supporters see mr kasich s bluntness as an asset he s sort of ornery said john novotny a dentist waiting in line to hear the governor speak he says what he feels and i kind of like that it s like he s not kowtowing to everybody i hope he stays that way advertisement
