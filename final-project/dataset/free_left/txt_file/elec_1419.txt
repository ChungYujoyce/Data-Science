advertisement by the new york times how donald trump vs hillary clinton looked to times opinion writers before during and after their last meeting in las vegas by peter wehner donald trump can t help being himself it s why he lost yet another debate and why he will lose the election the post debate coverage has been dominated by mr trump s refusal to say he won t accept the election results and rightly so it would be a shocking statement except for the fact that he has spent much of this month attempting to undermine the foundations of our democratic system that he would do so in a debate despite how obviously self destructive it was underscores what has always been his main weakness his unstable and disordered personality mr trump obsesses over polls and knows that the overwhelming odds are that he will lose psychologically he cannot accept that for him being labeled a loser is the ultimate humiliation therefore he has to manufacture an excuse for his impending defeat and in this case the excuse comes in the form of him repeatedly claiming that the election is rigged but that very claim which is an extraordinary transgression of an unwritten and almost sacred democratic rule not only will help insure his defeat but will make the margin of that defeat even worse most americans are unsettled and unnerved by mr trump and the more exposed to him they are the more unsettled and unnerved they become he doesn t come across as an agent of change which would help him instead he comes across as a radical and destabilizing force which hurts him narcissism in this instance the inability to accept that he is likely to lose to a woman in the biggest contest in the world was at the core of mr trump s answer about not being prepared to say he would abide by the outcome of the election what americans saw almost instantaneously in that answer is that the republican nominee for president puts himself his vanity his self obsession his need to project dominance and therefore his need to win far above everything in life including the best interest of the nation all of us struggle with pride and none of us is selfless but no one we have ever seen in american political life is as egotistical and selfish as donald trump that character flaw has led him to several terrible moments during this election including the one in wednesday s debate that sealed his defeat earlier in this campaign he was unable to cite his favorite bible passage here s one that he could have learned from and that foreshadowed his fate pride goes before destruction a haughty spirit before a fall peter wehner served in the last three republican administrations and is a contributing opinion writer by mark schmitt now that the full cycle of debates has come to an end there is at least one clear winner the committee for a responsible federal budget two questions in the vice presidential debate along with two from chris wallace in last night s presidential showdown referred to the committee which is devoted to deficit reduction and treated its analyses and proposals as matters of settled fact near the end of the debate mr wallace declared the committee for a responsible federal budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that medicare s going to run out of money in the 2020s social security is going to run out of money in the 2030s mr wallace went on to suggest that only a grand bargain combining tax increases with medicare and social security benefit cuts could solve the problem the committee for a responsible federal budget is an eminently respectable organization led by distinguished former members of congress and its analyses of budget data are sound i often agree with the organization s viewpoint but it is a viewpoint and it is hardly the only one countless economists budget analysts and other experts would argue that long term shortfalls in those two programs can be addressed by controlling health care costs and raising the cap on the social security tax so that higher earners pay a little more others would point out that entitlements which are simply a budget category have no special status on the chopping block and cuts to military spending for example could achieve the same purpose and other economists argue that any aggressive move toward deficit reduction would be unwise while the economy is still fragile these are no less responsible views imagine a question such as this according to the nonpartisan sierra club unless we reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to 350 parts per million climate change will be catastrophic what kind of carbon tax or cap and trade plan would you propose to avoid this result this is a trick question of sorts because in five hours of debate not one question about climate change was asked but if it had been this perfectly reasonable inquiry would have been denounced as leading accepting the argument of an advocacy group and presuming the appropriate policy solution just as mr wallace s question did with the grand bargain for several years this dogma about entitlements has held the status of received fact among journalists and pundits it s hard to think of another interest group argument that has had such influence on conventional opinion and usually politicians have followed along notably president obama who spent much of the middle period of his presidency in search of the grand bargain suggested by the committee for a responsible federal budget remarkably though neither candidate last night played along donald trump blustered that his tax cuts would generate economic growth of 5 or 6 percent hillary clinton rejected social security benefit cuts arguing that no more than a modest increase in the cap on payroll taxes was needed and she promised to reduce medicare spending by going after the drivers of health care costs to increase value emphasize wellness the debate moderators have not caught up but american politics has finally turned away from the suffocating belief that cuts to the two largest programs in the entitlement category of the budget are the only way to ensure long term economic health only one presidential candidate has a realistic alternative but nonetheless it s a breakthrough mark schmitt is the director of the political reform program at new america why was there virtually no attention paid to climate change in the debates maybe because not enough people care enough about it andrew c revkin in climate silence goes way beyond debate moderators by seth grossman the week after the second presidential debate felt like shark week on the trump reality network with the great white himself thrashing around in his own blood as hillary clinton s poll numbers surged his shackles were off there were high expectations going into the threequel threequels present a unique challenge audiences expect the exact same cast to make them feel the exact same way the first two installments did but with an entirely new and original storyline in the reality television business we often work with the cast to come up with the storyline prior to shooting and while we may not know how it ends we know more or less what s at stake and what each character wants the first debate was exciting the candidates faced off for ninety minutes in a raw unedited exchange mrs clinton baited donald trump and he came unraveled the second debate taking place two days after mr trump s access hollywood tape came out had an even more irresistible narrative american women were threatened by a sexual predator loose in town hall and our potential first female president came to the rescue mr trump himself unable to fight the power of the woman in peril storyline tried to re cast it with bill clinton in the villain role it flopped and for about twelve days so did he for the third debate an election fatigued america was promised a dangerous donald a wounded underdog with nothing to lose and mr trump does seem genuinely baffled to be losing this election despite what even his detractors have to admit is far superior entertainment value what he s failed to realize is that his preferred storyline a crime drama about a nasty woman stealing the election from hardworking white americans doesn t work when it s full of comedy gold like his puppet comeback his anger over an emmy snub and his promise to keep us in suspense about whether or not he ll respect the results of the election that s because mr trump s problems as a candidate mirror his problems as a reality tv star he s not a good collaborator television like politics is a team sport editors on the apprentice have complained that because of his capricious boardroom decisions they often had to go back and reverse engineer the results of challenges so that his choices made sense mr trump doesn t care about details of foreign policy the constitution or audio recording in the debates mr trump has repeatedly interrupted clinton a no no in reality tv as it makes editing dialogue impossible and a no no in electoral politics as it turns off voters especially women even mr trump s promise to leave us in suspense as to whether or not he ll honor election results which seems like good tv ignores the fact that this is a threequel a final installment voters want this election to end and we re more interested in who wins than in what donald trump does after he loses seth grossman is a filmmaker and reality television producer by j d vance the headline from last night s debate nearly writes itself a major party presidential candidate refused to accept the legitimacy of the 2016 election this is unprecedented in recent political history and donald j trump will undoubtedly wallow in the scorn of the mainstream press over the next few days yet i found myself wondering as debate co watchers gasped over mr trump s statements whether any of the trump supporters i know back home in southern ohio will actually care the answer is probably no at the core of his appeal is a rejection of mainstream political norms and this is just another example of mr trump slaughtering a proverbial sacred cow the question now is not whether mr trump will lose the election he will but whether the segment of our country that gasps when he delegitimizes our democratic institutions can ever be reconciled to those who cheer the same j d vance is the author of hillbilly elegy and a contributing writer the presidential debate was another exercise in narcissism bombast and mendacity by mr trump one could only hope that this might be the last grand display of his gross unfitness to be president the editorial board in donald trump s contempt for democracy by kevin baker by the end hillary clinton was like a champion matador moving masterfully around the perpetually snorting spewing infuriated bull she had finally goaded into going off on the same senseless paranoid alt right tears donald trump stomped off on one bizarre history making rant after another while mrs clinton deftly stepped around his horns and stuck another banderilla between the shoulder blades never before has an american candidate for president seemed to openly revel in the successes of a foreign terrorist organization against american troops and their allies as mr trump seemed to when he crowed that resistance in mosul is much tougher than we thought never has one accused his opponent of stealing or losing six billion dollars from the state department never has one accused his opponent of paying demonstrators 1 500 to start riots at his rallies or described the nato alliance as a protection racket mr trump simultaneously credited himself with making the euro patsies pay off mr trump sunk to new lows of infantile nonsense unable to restrain himself from nonstop mugging and smirking and shooting off his usual schoolboy taunts and jibes you can t mr trump told us when mrs clinton said let me translate this other brilliant pieces of repartee included constant repetitions of wrong wrong wrong why don t you give back the money you know it and i know it and everybody knows it we ve heard this before hillary and the grand misogynistic finale such a nasty woman before it was all over fox s chris wallace who incidentally proved himself by far the best moderator of the debates but who like all the rest offered not a single question on climate change was practically remonstrating with mr trump to join his own daughter in pledging to accept the election results mr trump to the end would offer only another thoroughly childish rejoinder i will tell you at the time i will keep you in suspense it was an appropriately petulant response a schoolboy s holdout when caught in a petty crime or an outright lie it would be no more than another self inflicted wound on his candidacy save for the fact that he was trying to hold the constitution of the united states and our civic unity hostage he then went on to say that the whole election was already rigged simply because mrs clinton had been allowed to run as opposed to being presumably in jail or under indictment from schoolboy to caudillo in one leap it was like every other aspect of the election that mr trump has touched a degrading spectacle but on top of it was added once again further proof that this would be berlusconi doesn t seem to even realize how the american constitutional system operates repeatedly berating mrs clinton for not having fixed single handedly everything wrong in the world including his own accountants financial wizardry with his taxes he seemed to believe right to the end that mrs clinton had spent the last 30 years as dictator of america or perhaps the world instead of being a single member of the senate and then a cabinet official no doubt this reflects mr trump s own view of what the american presidency is it is a belief as preadolescent as everything else about his candidacy to reward this tired demagogue with a vote would be as absurd as electing dennis the menace to the highest office in the land kevin baker is an essayist and the author most recently of america the ingenious by maureen dowd when melania trump stood by her man child the other night on cnn over the lewd comments to billy bush on a hot mic she told anderson cooper that her husband was led on like egged on from the host to say dirty and bad stuff she was offering her best defense but it was actually the best damnation at the final debate tonight in las vegas donald trump once more showed how easily egged on he is continuing to deploy lethal darts from her team of shrinks hillary clinton baited trump into a series of damaging nails in the coffin statements and it was so easy the one time litigator prosecuted the case against trump sparking another temperamental spiral as effectively as chris christie once broke down marco rubio in trump s warped fun house mirror of a psyche every rejection is a small death that is why he harps on humiliation that america is being humiliated on the world stage that we are losing potency a theme that resonates with angry voters who feel humiliated by their dwindling economic fortunes and angry about illegal immigrants and refugees swarming in who might be competition she once more proved adept at getting her rival s goat she again contended that he s not a self made man but a spoiled rich kid who was underwritten by his father and she accused him of choking on bringing up the issue of who would pay for the wall when he met with the president of mexico trump tried to stay calm but he can never let go of a slight he defended himself on groping charges by saying nobody has more respect for women than i do but he ended up after clinton s hazing donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger blurting out as she talked about entitlements such a nasty woman no doubt it is hard for a man whose lovely sphinx like wife rarely talks at dinners with friends to make room for more talking by trump to listen to an opinionated woman speak dismissively to him over 90 minutes when clinton called trump a putin puppet he unraveled once more proving how malleable he is with anyone from vladimir putin to clinton who either praises him or pokes him no puppet no puppet you re the puppet he said going into what the former obama chief speechwriter jon favreau tweeted was a full baldwin talking about putin trump once more offered the simple reason he has flipped his party s wary stance toward the evil empire subjugating his party s ideology to his own ego he said nice things about me similarly he reduced a debate about the supreme court to the fact that ruth bader ginsburg had attacked him and had to apologize he was so unnerved he said one of the most shocking things ever heard in a debate putting his ego ahead of american democracy asked by the admirable debate moderator fox news chris wallace if he would accept the results of the election or reject it as rigged trump replied coyly and self destructively i will tell you at the time adding i will keep you in suspense the inanity continued naturally when trump spinners talked to the press after the debate as the washington post s robert costa tweeted sarah palin told reporters that trump will accept only a legitimate election and anything else would betray those who died for freedom and the post s phil rucker tweeted that giuliani just predicted dems will steal the election in pennsylvania by busing in people from out of state to pose as dead people to cast ballots trump tried to give what one of his biographers timothy o brien calls his clint eastwood high plains drifter glare and spaghetti western talk we have some bad hombres here and we re gonna get em out he said about illegal immigrants who commit crimes but he was all hat no cattle he gets so easily distracted by belittling statements even though he dishes them out so easily that he could not focus to make points in areas where hillary is vulnerable in order to stop losing he would have to stop losing it but he didn t he got egged on bigly by roxane gay one of the things that have long defined the united states is that we are able to peacefully transition power every four years this peaceful transition is one of the fundamentals of our democracy politics in this country can be fractious and messy but since 1789 there has been a presidential winner and the loser has accepted the results and conceded if not always gracefully four years later rinse and repeat early in this election cycle i was dismissive of donald j trump he was a lousy businessman and reality television star he was a man with what seems to be a toupee and a bad fake tan who decided that he would tell people what they want to hear while basking in the attention he so clearly craved he stood for nothing i told myself so he could not do much harm were he to stumble into power how wrong i was mr trump s campaign slogan make america great again was designed to make disgruntled americans feel like their fortunes might change with a trump presidency really though it was a slogan predicated on the idea that america could not possibly flourish without him mr trump made himself messianic and did so on the backs of immigrants and muslims and women and the lgbt community people who could ill afford to bear his burden and the very people his base resents and now here we are with less than three weeks until the election the candidate of a major party is fomenting unrest and continues to self destruct the joke hasn t been funny for a very long time hillary clinton a capable intelligent woman is running against an unworthy opponent and we are so distracted by the putrescent carnival of his candidacy that there has been little opportunity to hold her feet to the fire on her hawkish foreign policy and the other issues there have been many unprecedented developments during this 2016 election cycle but nothing is as appalling and unsettling as donald trump s growing rumblings that the election is rigged because he is surely going to lose in a historic fashion in tonight s debate mr trump was asked if he would accept the election results and he said he would have to wait and see this terrifying comment was in part a crumb he tossed to his base but given what s at stake this unserious candidate must be taken seriously we can t dismiss his comment as immaturity or the empty words of a sore loser and narcissist who thinks this is all a game we have to recognize mr trump s blatant lack of respect for american voters democracy or the gravity of the office of president we have to recognize that he is trying to delegitimize and poison a hillary clinton presidency before it even begins and we cannot let that happen roxane gay is an associate professor at purdue university the author of bad feminist and the forthcoming hunger and a contributing opinion writer but jeepers people this is serious trump was refusing to acknowledge it was even possible for him to lose a fair fight at one point he announced the election was rigged because hillary clinton was in it gail collins in the debate in one scary answer by susan chira donald j trump dismissed hillary clinton with all the anger and contempt of a man who has repeatedly been called out for how he treats women such a nasty woman he said mrs clinton has pursued a calculated strategy of baiting her opponent to see if he would lash out she called him a puppet of vladimir putin among other digs mr trump clearly could no longer contain himself by the end of this debate that cutting dismissal as well as his taunt that her husband didn t agree with her played to the heart of the gender dynamics of this election a man hypersensitive to criticism of any kind was under constant challenge from a confident assertive woman mr trump s advisers knowing that he had to win over women particularly the suburban women who have voted republican in the past have tried coaching him to keep his cool his daughter ivanka tried putting forward a child care plan but mrs clinton got under his thin skin and it showed in the first debate he started off with elaborate courtesy secretary clinton he said calling attention to how he was using the title even as mrs clinton called him donald but he couldn t stop himself from interrupting her reminding women of how often men have talked over them at work or at home when the clinton campaign deployed alicia machado the former miss universe in a campaign ad talking about how he shamed her for gaining weight he doubled down reminding women of how vulnerable they are to the male gaze the second debate surely one of the most surreal on record was consumed by the fallout over mr trump s boasts that his fame entitled him to force himself on women his denials during that debate prompted woman after woman to come forward recounting how he groped them claims he dismissed as lies mr trump paraded women who say they had suffered at the hands of bill clinton at a time when such degradations did not resonate in society as they do now and men were not held accountable that was a double standard but that tactic is also a way of blaming a woman for her husband s infidelity and it does not seem to have scored many political points among the women mr trump needed to win over mr trump went into this debate knowing that the polls show him trailing her in state after key state the very women he has treated his whole life as objects to leer at or belittle now are exacting their revenge many tell pollsters they are not voting for him nobody has more respect for women than i do mr trump insisted after chris wallace the debate s moderator challenged him about the accusations of groping his own words contradicted his claim susan chira is a senior correspondent and editor on gender issues for the new york times by emily bazelon at the outset of the debate donald trump said he believed in the idea of originalism offering an audience friendly translation by promising that his nominees for the supreme court will interpret the constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted nothing was more sacred to the founders than the peaceful transition of power without that we don t have a democracy and more than anything else that s what 1776 and beyond was about yet asked if he would accept the result of this election mr trump said he d think about it when the time comes and then he d let us know this amazing moment of noncommitment is already dominating the post debate talk it was indefensible so don t expect other republicans including his running mate mike pence to defend it they ll spin maybe by saying mr trump just wants to make sure the vote count is accurate or some such but of course the republican nominee just insinuated far more than that he made a political mistake you have to be fully in the trump column an unstoppable die hard to welcome the alarming uncertainty and instability of contested election results but beyond that a candidate for president who is committed to upholding the constitution would never leave the country in suspense about this question asked the easiest question of the night with the stakes so high mr trump went for attention grabbing irresponsible suspense he decided to act the part of the reality tv star he once was not the major party standard bearer he is supposed to be emily bazelon is a staff writer at the times magazine by will wilkinson midway into the third and final presidential debate chris wallace asked donald trump about all the women who have come forward to report that mr trump had sexually assaulted them mr trump s reply was desperate and surreally brazen those people i don t know those people mr trump said referring to the women who said he had attacked them i have a feeling how they came i believe it was her campaign that did it mr trump then claimed that the clinton campaign had paid people 1 500 apiece to foment violence at a trump rally in chicago this was offered as indirect support for his new preferred explanation for the string of devastating sexual assault allegations the clinton campaign pays women to lie i didn t know any of these women he said i didn t see these women one of those women natasha stoynoff disclosed that mr trump once pressed her against a wall and forced his tongue into her mouth at his mansion in florida she was at his home to interview mr trump and his pregnant third wife for a profile in people magazine maybe you don t need to see a woman to attack her in an empty room in your mansion but he knows her he knows her it s all fiction mr trump said it s lies and it s fiction probably or possibly all started by her very sleazy campaign it s all lies all right it s all fiction and sleazy is the perfect word for sure sleaze from wingtips to combover mr trump knows what he did mr trump knows what he is so do we will wilkinson is the vice president for policy at the niskanen center and a columnist at vox by arthur c brooks for the first time for a few precious minutes we had something like a normal debate donald j trump calmly proposed conventional conservative policies on taxes social issues and the second amendment similarly hillary clinton articulated the standard democratic critique of republican tax plans and pitched other familiar proposals such as comprehensive immigration reform that her side has been proposing for years it was almost encouraging but then these candidates jerked us back to the sad reality of this election mrs clinton reminded us why she is distrusted with unconvincing answers about her ethics almost unfathomably trump even refused to say he would concede the election if he loses as the evening progressed concrete solutions mostly disappeared and the tone became far more biting and sarcastic the candidates were openly contemptuous and disrespectful of each other neither was hopeful neither seemed to speak to americans with optimism neither seemed happy or excited at the prospect of being elected president in other words the debate sank back to the grim status quo the point of politics is persuasion a campaign is supposed to bring people into the fold candidates always have to reassure the true believers yes but more than that they must persuade people on the fence and maybe even soften up those who are hostile no one in history has ever insulted another person into persuasion that s axiomatic you can insult someone into a fight or into a lawsuit or into a divorce but not into agreement the most fundamental problem with these two candidates illustrated so clearly in tonight s debate is that they both exhibit an apparent lack of understanding of this axiom it s not just a question of suboptimal communications it speaks to the leadership deficit that has led so many americans to believe they have no good choice is this election a temporary aberration or are the politics of contempt permanently replacing the politics of persuasion whether 2016 becomes an unpleasant memory or the new normal for our nation will depend on us on our reaction to this election and the kind of leaders we reward going forward arthur c brooks is the president of the american enterprise institute and a contributing opinion writer by wajahat ali are you not entertained is this not why we re here after watching the final presidential debate and reminiscing about this absolutely absurd and historic election i m reminded of the poem auto wreck by karl shapiro which i read in elementary school the traffic moves around with care but we remain touching a wound that opens to our richest horror this election cycle has opened up a uniquely american pandora s box of horrors and delights i am forever changed how can i ever go back to serious boring talk about policies that could affect the lives of millions how can i sit through sober conversations about foreign policy and individual liberties who needs elitist jabberwocky when you ve just fed me glorious sex talk bad hombres alicia machado celebrity apprentice howard stern bragging about anatomical size mexicans as rapists white supremacists anti semitic trolling threats against journalists encouraging foreign governments to hack our emails reckless allegations of election rigging threats to jail presidential candidates access hollywood videos khizr khan the mockery of gold star mothers gennifer flowers ben carson s fruit salad of their lives and the use and abuse of pepe the frog as a symbol to promote a nativist racist agenda sensationalism has replaced sobriety conspiracy theories and baseless allegations have replaced facts diplomacy and tact are mocked and victories are measured not by intelligent policy positions but by snarky tweets and rhetorical low blows this is the election america deserves not the one it needs it encapsulates and unleashes our collective id on the world despite the titillation i m sad i recognize the tragedy because we all suffer and will suffer moving forward it s like a super size fast food meal or maybe even bad porn it satiates you in the moment but fills you with regret and shame but at least we were entertained wajahat ali is the author of the play the domestic crusaders and creative director of affinis labs a hub for social entrepreneurship and innovation by andrew rosenthal remember when people including me thought that donald trump s invitation for russian hackers to invade hillary clinton s emails was one of the most breathtakingly undemocratic things ever said by a presidential candidate we were so na ve on the debate stage in las vegas on wednesday donald trump flatly refused twice to say that he would accept the results of the election asked by the moderator chris wallace of fox news whether he would make the same commitment to respect democracy made by his running mate mike pence and his daughter ivanka trump gave us one of his smug looks i will look at it at the time he said i don t take much of what trump says seriously he s not going to build a wall on the mexican border just for starters unless his own company gets the contracts but there is nothing more precious to american democracy than the peaceful transfer of power according to the will of the voters it s the founding principle of our country not apparently to donald trump who earlier in the debate claimed to be a great champion of judges who applied the constitution literally as it was written which of course would mean that barack obama and hillary clinton could never have voted never mind become president he blamed hillary clinton personally for inciting violence at his rallies a lie and said that the news media are colluding with the democratic nominee to poison the minds of voters which is also untrue unless quoting his own words counts as poisoning trump then went on to talk about the millions of people who are falsely registered to vote another lie wallace asked trump again to simply say he would honor the election results trump s reply what i am saying is that i will tell you at the time i will keep you in suspense clinton responded with a huge understatement that s horrifying she said trump won t commit to honoring the election results he is encouraging people to go to voting places to monitor voter fraud a dog whistle for intimidating minority voters and now he says he won t stand by the american people s judgment i don t believe trump is going to lead a popular uprising after election day he s not the leader of a movement as he says he s a narcissist if he loses he ll probably go back where he came from to the haze of reality tv and shady business dealings but it was still terrifying to see someone in an american presidential debate implying that he did not respect the democratic system by teresa tritch on the debt donald trump says that his economic plan will unleash so much economic growth that rising debt from record tax cuts and increased spending on defense will not be a problem that is dodging the issue hillary clinton says that her economic proposals are paid for which analyses from moody s and the tax policy center generally agree with as for entitlements social security and medicare to strengthen the financing of medicare and social security will require tax increases or benefit cuts or some combination of both mr trump says only that he will cut taxes and that obamacare must be repealed and replaced that is simply not an answer mrs clinton has quickly ticked off some of the tax increases she would support such as raising the level of wages that are taxed to provide revenue for social security she does not favor benefit cuts the proposals she has put forth would not close the entire financing gap in social security but they could close it part way teresa tritch is a member of the editorial board by ioan grillo whether donald j trump had thought up the phrase in what he calls debate preparation or it slipped spontaneously off his tongue he opened his immigration answer with one of the night s most memorable quotes which quickly sparked a twitter storm and made meme writers get to work on both side of the rio grande we have some bad hombres here and we are going to get em out mr trump said before that he had mentioned drug lords and others he wanted to deport besides the comedy value the phrase sums up trumpism well talking tough playing on prejudice but not suggesting a clear policy change in short playing to emotion rather than logic deporting migrants who commit crimes is already american policy last year 91 percent of people deported from the interior of the united states i e not caught trying to cross the actual border had criminal convictions mr trump went on to say under obama millions of people have been moved out of this country they ve been deported he was right in total immigration and customs enforcement deported 235 413 people in 2015 alone but as that is the case mr trump is proving that he is suggesting nothing different hillary clinton also said she wanted to continue the policy of deporting criminals i want to put our resources where i think they are most needed getting rid of any violent person anybody who should be deported she said mr trump s bad hombres phrase is distinctly softer than the toxic they re rapists phrase that kick started his campaign and his immigration answer over all was notable for being softer than his earlier rhetoric and calling for the deportation of criminals rather than the entire 11 million undocumented migrants in this it sums up another element of trumpism flip flop ioan grillo is the author of gangster warlords drug dollars killing fields and the new politics of latin america and a contributing opinion writer by anna north donald trump said during wednesday night s debate that he truly believes he will win the election he s probably wrong in the traditional sense polls show he is unlikely to win the necessary electoral votes to become president but mr trump has normalized racism and xenophobia his comment wednesday about bad hombres coming from mexico was only the latest example he has normalized sexism when he referred to mrs clinton as a nasty woman during the debate it was one of his tamer comments he has tacitly encouraged voter intimidation and called the legitimacy of the election into question saying in the debate that he s not sure if he ll accept the results he has brought the whole election season down to his level and ensured that any 2020 candidate who doesn t brag about his history of sexual assault will look sane by comparison and if he doesn t become president he won t have to deal with any of these problems he can just sit back perhaps from an anchor s chair at his new tv channel and watch no matter what happens on nov 8 mr trump has already won in one way he s made a gigantic mess and somebody else has to clean it up anna north is a member of the editorial board by paul krugman over all chris wallace was better than i expected but he was pretty bad on fiscal issues first of all still obsessing over the debt still taking leads from the committee for a responsible federal budget federal debt simply isn t a pressing issue there is no possible reason to make a big deal about it while neglecting climate change where every year that action is delayed makes the problem harder to solve then there was the discussion of economic policy it was really bad and inappropriate when wallace talked about the obama stimulus and simply asserted that it led to slow growth that was editorializing and bad economics the past eight years have actually been a huge experiment in macroeconomics saying that the obama stimulus was followed by slow growth is a terrible argument when you spend money to fight a terrible slump weren t any disappointments in performance arguably caused by whatever caused the slump not by the rescue operation but we have a lot of other evidence all of which says that spending money in a slump helps the economy and that the obama stimulus was therefore the right thing to do some of that evidence comes from the details of the stimulus itself which had different effects in different regions and that tells you a lot about how it worked and the answer is that it was positive even more compelling is the anti stimulus that came from austerity policies in europe countries that slashed spending and raised taxes had much deeper slumps than those that didn t basically events have strongly confirmed the keynesian thinking that lay behind the obama stimulus the impression that it failed comes mainly from the fact that it wasn t big enough to produce a rapid turnaround and no that s not after the fact rationalization i and others were practically screaming at the time that it wasn t sufficiently large i suspect that mr wallace doesn t know anything about that in his circles the stimulus is assumed to have been a failure the good news is that mrs clinton knows better a lot better and is actually proposing a sensible mix of policies looking forward trump s economics is far from the scariest thing about him but it would be plenty scary if it weren t for everything else he says by viet thanh nguyen donald j trump shows that his greatest mastery is over the reality show drama i ll keep you in suspense he said in response to chris wallace s question about whether he would concede if he lost the election he guarantees that we all will keep watching to see whether he will undermine american democracy ironically he accuses the media of being corrupt and dishonest when he is a part of the media that is ostensibly debasing the american population he accuses the election of being rigged when reality shows like the apprentice are rigged and he accuses those who accuse him of sexual harassment or assault of seeking their 10 minutes of fame which is also the premise of his reality television world his behavior is in keeping with reality television in which those who survive and win are those who know that fictional reality is more important than worldly reality worldly reality still manages to make itself visible however hillary clinton argues that mr trump is owned by the russians and the chinese mr trump argues that mrs clinton is owned by wall street sadly they may both be right that is what the reality show drama of the presidential debates may mask but not completely by drowning us in insults and tawdriness reality shows may be a spectacle but at their core is an ugly kernel of reality viet thanh nguyen is the author most recently of nothing ever dies vietnam and the memory of war by carol giacomo hillary clinton said the most important question of the debate was whether donald trump was willing to condemn vladimir putin s attempt to interfere in the election an unprecedented move by a foreign government and she may be right mr trump however did not have a good answer he started to perspire and mostly spouted gibberish unable to muster a convincing or coherent argument for what he would do to keep the country safe against the authoritarian russian president who is challenging the united states in syria and elsewhere and seeking to undermine the nato alliance i don t know putin mr trump protested he said nice things about me which is hardly the serious answer one might hope for from a candidate seeking to lead the united states instead he argued that mr putin the authoritarian russian president has no respect for mrs clinton and has outsmarted her every step of the way in syria well that s because he d rather have a puppet as president of the united states mrs clinton responded in a rapier like retort once again mr trump conspicuously refused to acknowledge that mrs clinton a former secretary of state has not been in office for more than three years and that mr putin is bombing civilians in aleppo in what may be a war crime in support of bashar al assad the brutal syrian president mr trump has consistently said he admired mr putin and refused to acknowledge the unanimous conclusion of america s 17 intelligence agencies that russia has hacked the emails of the democratic national committee and other agencies mrs clinton pressed him on this point demanding that he explain why he encouraged russia to conduct cyber attacks mr trump again refused to accept the intelligence findings or even acknowledge the professionals behind them she has no idea whether it s russia china or anybody else he said only when the moderator chris wallace pressed mr trump on whether he would condemn interference by russia did the candidate say by russia or anybody else nevertheless mr trump added if the united state got along with russia it wouldn t be so bad carol giacomo is a member of the editorial board by mark schmitt donald trump denigrates democracy as hillary clinton said when he suggests that the election is rigged or will be rigged or that his opponent shouldn t have been allowed to run but he also shows a bizarre disregard for the idea that democracy is a collaborative enterprise that it s not a system in which a single individual exercises total power that s evident in his repeated claims that clinton as a senator could have changed the law on for example the tax breaks he s taken it s evident on his own side as well with the idea that he can build a wall or single handedly impose tariffs or taxes on companies that move jobs abroad trump doesn t understand the basics about how american government works but beyond all the technicalities he also shows a staggering lack of regard or even acknowledgment of democracy as a joint enterprise rather than a sole proprietorship mark schmitt is the director of the political reform program at new america by emily bazelon well that was exciting for me as a scotus nerd the supreme court was up to bat first in the debate and the exchange was sharply defining most memorably on abortion in past elections presidential candidates have soft pedaled their views on the subject this time mrs clinton sounded resolute and even righteous about defending a woman s right to control one of the most intimate and difficult decisions about her health care mr trump used strong language too describing how he wants to prevent the ripping of the baby out of the womb on the last day of pregnancy this is what his base wants to hear many republicans especially religious ones cite the prospect of future nominations to the court as their reason for supporting mr trump despite their distaste for oh just about everything else about him so he checked that box though oddly he didn t simply say yes when the moderator chris wallace asked whether he wanted the supreme court to overturn roe v wade maybe his old pro choice self couldn t quite bear to say it or maybe he wanted to soften his stance a bit i heard a bit of moderation in his promise to appoint pro life judges who would send the issue back to the states mrs clinton talked to her base too she talked about her opposition and trump s support for defunding planned parenthood the polls are with her on that one she got in a gibe reminding mr trump of his quickly retracted statement of support for punishing women who seek abortions it s a fairly logical end once you go down the road of outlawing the procedure but abortion opponents are trained to talk about jailing abortionists not women she described the most heartbreaking circumstances that often led women to late term abortion risk to their own life or health or the discovery of serious birth defects that s not the only reason for abortion after the first trimester but it s a significant issue i ll confess i felt a small thrill more than at any big moment since the convention mrs clinton owned her feminism she sounded like the first woman running for president defending other women our autonomy and our control of our own bodies emily bazelon is a staff writer at the times magazine by teresa tritch many of hillary clinton s proposals are investments in human capital early education debt free college apprenticeships investments in human capital are an effort to boost long term productivity and promote growth recommending tax increases that would pay for those investments is an effort to ensure that bolstered economic output is not offset by a rising deficit in other words it is coherent economic projections and economic history do not support donald trump s assertion that big tax cuts at the center of his economic plan his proposed tax cut would be the biggest ever would promote growth for the middle class high end tax cuts during the george w bush administration for example only led to inequality and lopsided growth the economy under mrs clinton s plan would be flat at first and stronger later under mr trump s plan the economy would get a boost at first from the cash unleashed by the tax cuts but become much weaker later as the huge deficits from the tax cuts reduced the plan s initial positive effect on economic output teresa tritch is a member of the editorial board by anna north donald trump is generally only too willing to opine on topics about which he knows nothing but there s one topic on which he is uncharacteristically muckle mouthed abortion when chris wallace asked if he wanted the supreme court to overturn roe v wade he said if that would happen because i am pro life and i will be appointing pro life judges i would think that that will go back to the individual states this made little sense so mr wallace asked again this time mr trump said if we put another two or perhaps three justices on that s really what s going to be that will happen it ll happen automatically in my opinion because i am putting pro life justices on the court this is hardly an answer and it s an odd evasion of responsibility usually mr trump likes to take credit for making things happen why would he want to pretend roe v wade could be overturned automatically mr trump s uncharacteristic equivocation on abortion may be emblematic of something else for his base reproductive rights aren t a core issue he knows he can stir people up with talk of the wall trade and locking up hillary clinton but banning abortion has never been a big applause line for him so he s never had to develop a position on it amid all the horrors of this election season the fact that the candidate hasn t figured out a way to use the abortion issue to stir up hate is i suppose a small blessing anna north is a member of the editorial board by roxane gay throughout this election cycle most women have yearned for the candidates to talk about reproductive freedom to say the word abortion to share their positions on roe v wade tonight after the endless gantlet of primary debates and two presidential debates the candidates finally had a relatively robust discussion about abortion mr trump plainly pandered to his base offering inaccurate graphic rhetoric about late term abortions while mrs clinton spoke to the reality of late term abortions and the extremities emotional and physical for women who have to make that choice mrs clinton is generally a strong debater but when she spoke on abortion and her commitment to upholding roe v wade she was confident and passionate her words on abortion were a clear reminder that many many women are going to vote for hillary clinton because our right to bodily autonomy and our very lives will be much safer thus far in fact mrs clinton has been confident and passionate in all her responses she has taken the gloves off and seems far less tolerant of mr trump s empty half formed responses and barbs she has plainly articulated her ideas and plans because she has ideas and plans to articulate mr trump meanwhile becomes increasingly unraveled when he meets the fragile borders of his limited knowledge as he has in the previous presidential debates he says exactly what his base wants to hear and he talks to and about clinton with derision at best if he cannot present himself as a viable candidate he will for sure do what he can to present mrs clinton as equally unviable the contrast between the candidates is stark roxane gay is an associate professor at purdue university the author of bad feminist and the forthcoming hunger and a contributing opinion writer by katha pollitt tonight s debate highlights the contrast on abortion between hillary clinton and donald j trump she talked about women their complex lives and their right and ability to make responsible decisions about their pregnancies he talked about mythical day before birth abortions she talked about the medical crises that make later abortions necessary he talked some more about mythical day before birth abortions she reminded the nation that mr trump called for punishing women who ended their pregnancies if he had an answer i missed it mr trump has had months and months to educate himself on abortion and abortion rights as a matter of law medical practice social policy and women s lives actually he s had his whole adult life but never mind many abortion opponents could have helped him sound compassionate and concerned for women to talk about poverty for example and sexual violence and coercion and the need to make a society more welcoming to mothers and families these factors hardly justify making abortion a crime but talking about them at least acknowledges that abortions happen for a reason other than women s evil love of fetal destruction mr trump seems not to have bothered even to learn the talking points of his own side and couldn t be bothered to pretend to care either mrs clinton by contrast gave the answer pro choicers have longed to hear an acknowledgment that legal abortion is part of the fabric of women s lives sympathy for what women go through in crisis pregnancies and respect for women s ability to decide these matters for themselves katha pollitt is a columnist at the nation and the author most recently of pro reclaiming abortion rights by kevin baker the debate started sluggishly with both candidates sounding tired and the hoarse voiced trump in particular seeming like an extinguished volcano able only to belch out the occasional puff of noxious gas but hillary clinton obviously had a plan and used it to goad trump on the undocumented aliens he used to build trump tower and then to shackle him to the russian computer hacks by calling him putin s puppet it was an amazing almost unprecedented moment in american history to have one candidate openly accuse the other of being the stooge of a foreign potentate and with the accused having no real rebuttal beyond i don t know him kevin baker is an essayist and the author most recently of the historical novel the big crowd by viet thanh nguyen first i ll be honest i was stone cold sober during the first two debates and they both really hurt for this one i have a bottle of glenlivet 18 year old single malt by my side i take it neat in case anyone cares to buy me a drink i ll need the scotch in case my ears and eyes start to bleed around immigration mr trump s racial coding becomes most evident although his singling out of chicago as a crime ridden city is also racially coded he gestures at mothers whose children have been killed by undocumented immigrants he argues that drugs flow over the border clearly implying that they are being brought by those south of the border while cash flows out we have bad hombres here he says channeling his inner clint eastwood the reality however is that walls won t keep people or drugs out and walls won t keep profits in but sometimes mr trump does score valid points when hillary clinton argues against deportation mr trump accurately pointed to the fact that president obama has deported a great number of people i hope mr trump also highlights the extra legality of the obama administration s use of drone strikes and kill lists but i assume he would want to do the same thing viet thanh nguyen is the author most recently of nothing ever dies vietnam and the memory of war
