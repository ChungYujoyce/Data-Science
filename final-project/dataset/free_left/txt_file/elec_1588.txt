trump s short list that we didn t mention here or pick hillary clinton s vp from our list of 27 originally published june 8 shore up republican establishment support appeal to independent voters reinforce a populist outsider campaign narrative these are the kind of questions presidential nominees weigh when choosing their vice presidential nominees trump emerged victorious from the primaries but he needs to unite the party including many republicans who are wary of his brash style and inexperience 19 insiders completing the ticket with an establishment friendly known commodity republican could do wonders in pushing the doubters toward acceptance kelly ayotte senator from new hampshire chris christie new jersey governor bob corker senator from tennessee carly fiorina former hewlett packard ceo from california rudy giuliani former new york city mayor nikki haley south carolina governor bill haslam tennesee governor bobby jindal former louisiana governor john kasich ohio governor

looking for somebody that can walk into the senate and who s been friendly with these guys for 25 years and people for 25 years and can get things done so i would 95 percent see myself picking a political person as opposed to somebody from the outside tennessee sen bob corker would have fit the senate insider bill but he removed himself from consideration on july 6 corker withdraws as potential trump running mate of course there is still a chance his thinking on this could change for instance trump could decide to go with a military figure such as david petraeus in may the fix s philip bump made a surprisingly persusaive case for trump to choose his daughter ivanka for trump to have any chance at winning in november he ll need to do something to mitigate his high unfavorability among hispanic voters and women picking a woman could also make clinton s pitch for putting the first woman in the white house less effective 17 historic firsts picking a female or minority running mate could help trump with those groups kelly ayotte senator from new hampshire marsha blackburn congresswoman from tennessee jan brewer former arizona governor ben carson

senator from alabama john thune senator from south dakota scott walker wisconsin governor some potential obstacles for trump govs nikki haley of south carolina and susana martinez of new mexico have been outspoken critics of his and it s unclear whether they would even be open to consideration trump says remarks about federal judge s mexican heritage were misconstrued with the senate s balance of power very much in play plucking certain senators from their seats could mean putting seats in play and possibly handing over senate control sen kelly ayotte is locked in a contentious must win senate battle for republicans in new hampshire an effort is underway to coax sen marco rubio of florida into running for reelection after polls showed chances of republicans losing that seat too 5 people who are never going to be donald trump s vice president trump has said he plans to turn industrial and typically blue midwestern states red with his anti free trade message he will also need to consider how important it is to choose someone from a swing state but the jury seems to be out on whether a vp pick from such a place helps deliver that state s electoral votes or whether it matters at all 4

martinez new mexico governor sarah palin former alaska governor condoleezza rice former secretary of state from california brian sandoval nevada governor john thune senator from south dakota by picking giuliani as his vp trump could effectively forfeit the state of new york where both reside the constitution says a presidential ticket can t win the electoral votes of a state where both candidates reside though one of them could change their residency as then texas resident dick cheney did in 2000 this likely wouldn t matter to trump though as republicans are unlikely to compete for new york with two new yorkers leading the major party tickets a running mate from elsewhere is likely popular ohio gov john kasich would seem an obvious choice especially given that he leads perhaps the most important swing state for republicans but a spokesman told the new york times no chance other swing state folks in the mix include sen joni ernst of iowa and florida gov rick scott the fix s first 2016 electoral college ratings are here here is the most recent ranking of trump s likely vp choices as seen by fix boss chris cillizza former speaker of the house from georgia gingrich s weaknesses are similar to trump s he veers off message often his personal life has been complicated and his ego is well massive but gingrich s recent decision to change his position on trade he helped pass nafta but now says he supports trump s more protectionist approach suggests he knows he s very much in the running and wants to make clear he very much wants the job new jersey governor christie has been by trump s side more than any other politician and according to reporting on their relationship is one of the few people who has the presumptive republican presidential nominee s ear indiana governor pence is someone with strong ties to social conservatives a voting bloc trump continues to struggle to attract and has spent time not only in congress but also as a member of gop leadership
