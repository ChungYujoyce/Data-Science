advertisement supported by by trip gabriel des moines donald j trump has dominated much of this political season excited an often ignored part of the electorate filled huge arenas with followers and upended the rules of how modern campaigns are run but now he faces an urgent question can he actually win crucial early contest states translating a personality driven campaign to the voting booth is no easy feat especially for a candidate who has never run before but here in the state with the first nominating contest about six weeks away mr trump has fallen behind in the nuts and bolts of organizing a loss in iowa for mr trump where he has devoted the most resources of his campaign could imperil his leads in the next two nominating states new hampshire and south carolina where his get out the vote organizations are even less robust a successful ground game is crucial in iowa because of the state s complicated method of caucus voting but the trump campaign has lagged in reaching some of its own benchmarks mr trump s iowa director predicted that he would recruit a leader for each of the state s 1 681 republican precincts by thanksgiving instead the first major training session for precinct leaders heavily promoted in emails and conference calls drew only about 80 people to west des moines last weekend with about 50 participating online some of mr trump s republican rivals have spent months calling and knocking on doors to identify potential supporters to draw them out to caucuses but mr trump does not appear to have invested in this crucial voter id strategy until recently the trump campaign hopes to attract a surge of independents and disaffected democrats on caucus night but the latest data from the iowa secretary of state show no significant growth in republican registrations interviews in iowa with mr trump s campaign workers his volunteers and dozens of attendees at his rallies over two months as well as observations of voter outreach conference calls and confidential training sessions indicate that mr trump s support in the feb 1 iowa caucuses may fall short of his poll numbers in the state he is now trading the lead position with senator ted cruz of texas see what the candidates are saying about gun control immigration and more and how their positions align with the american people mr trump s greatest organizing asset is a database of thousands of email addresses of iowans who have attended packed rallies yet it appears that organizers have only recently begun tapping that database which a democratic strategist in iowa called malpractice the magic number of voters the trump campaign has revealed it wants to turn out 48 000 is highly optimistic in the view of other republican campaigns and independent experts it s easy for someone to sit on a phone when they get a polling call and say i like candidate x said steve grubbs the iowa state director for senator rand paul of kentucky referring to mr trump s strength in iowa polls it s far different to get that person out of a la z boy to hop in a car and avoid the black ice and head to their local firehouse mr grubbs who said he had already signed up 800 precinct captains for mr paul added you really have to put your organization together by dec 15 mr trump has about 15 paid iowa staff members compared with 36 working for a super pac supporting ben carson that is organizing in his behalf in iowa asked where carson supporters have canvassed in iowa tina goff who is directing the troops said where haven t we canvassed the campaign of mr cruz opened a 48 bed dormitory in des moines this month nicknamed camp cruz for what it says will be 500 volunteers from out of state they will knock on doors and make calls to potential supporters who are identified by microtargeting software because of the peculiar nature of the caucuses for which voters gather in classrooms and senior centers at an appointed hour turnout is lower than for primaries a representative of each candidate a precinct captain may give a brief speech and then there is a secret ballot only about one in five active registered republicans have historically participated making a candidate s get out the vote organizing critical but mr trump so far is not running a traditional campaign reliant on the fundamentals said jeff patch a republican strategist in iowa unaffiliated with a candidate a campaign depending on turning out low propensity g o p voters and bringing new voters into the process should be registering people in december and january in davenport a blue collar city on the mississippi river a paid trump staff member and two volunteers worked their phones early this month from a restaurant booth encouraging people to attend a dec 5 rally with mr trump history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling fanned across the table was an inch thick stack of pages with registered republicans the campaign had yet to narrow the universe of thousands of republicans in the davenport area to potential trump supporters the kind of screening some campaigns had already done betsey tibbitts a volunteer sipping white wine got off a call with a voter named mildred mildred is a big x she said mildred is not going to vote for him she was more encouraged on the next call when a woman said she was logging on to her computer right then to register for free tickets to the rally chuck laudner mr trump s iowa state director declined repeated requests to discuss the details of his field effort in a brief interview after a trump rally he disputed the notion that mr trump could not turn out a huge wave of first time caucusgoers the media says the conventional wisdom is new people don t come out and vote he said in the 1980s he added when i cut my teeth pat robertson turned out the entire religious right that had never mobilized before the demographics of trump supporters reveal his challenges they are younger lack a college degree and are less likely to be evangelical christians according to polling the profile of past caucusgoers is the opposite most are 45 and up college educated and evangelical what the trump campaign has going for it is the enthusiasm the candidate inspires at his rallies which are the largest of any republican i take trump s caucus prospects very seriously said an operative supporting another candidate speaking on the condition of anonymity to candidly assess a rival it s true that new candidates think they can change history it s true that they never do it s true we ve never had a new candidate like trump trump supporters compare him to another candidate in recent caucus history who generated record setting turnout by first time voters barack obama but unlike the trump campaign mr obama invested heavily in iowa he had over 200 paid staff members in more than 60 offices derek eadon an obama organizer in 2007 and a political consultant in des moines said that despite collecting contact information for people to attend trump rallies the campaign was neglecting follow through it s very tough to activate via email without field staff following up on the phone and asking them to volunteer or talk about the campaign he said it s malpractice not to follow up with those folks immediately of eight people interviewed at a trump rally in waterloo in early october all gave the trump campaign their emails contacted recently by a reporter four of the eight said they had not received any follow up the others received a mass email asking them to volunteer for mr trump but they were uninterested russell hotchkiss said he was too busy with a 1 year old and a small business to be a political activist judy cruze a nurse deleted the campaign s emails and has no intention of caucusing for anyone for its training session last weekend the trump campaign had sought out people who had attended rallies to be caucus leaders the modest participation for the session in person and online contradicted mr laudner s promise to have nearly 1 700 caucus leaders in place by thanksgiving as he told nbc news in october the volunteer leaders known as precinct captains learned that they would be responsible for bringing 25 or more people from their neighborhoods to the caucuses they were shown how to download an app ground game 2 with a walk list of registered republicans in their precincts it was clear from the training that the trump campaign was only beginning to identify supporters and that its volunteers could face unique challenges in going door to door just listen to them a trump staff member advised volunteers on how to elicit and record issues on voters minds if they re concerned about the border he said mark down immigration if they re worried about space aliens stealing the fillings out of their teeth it s other tana goertz a peppy former contestant on the apprentice mr trump s reality television program enticingly held out the prospect of rewards for the best performers like a game show at the end of the caucus night mr trump is going to know who won
