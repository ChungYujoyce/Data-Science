as his campaign chief donald trump has delighted every journalist who feared a slowdown of campaign explosions even if we will miss influence peddler paul manafort but it doesn t portend victory as wisconsin radio host charlie sykes summed up bannon s appointment trump s campaign has now entered the hospice phase he knows he s dying and wants to surround himself with his loved ones things could naturally change because things always change the debates are still over a month away but defeat is in the air recently i tried to tease out what hillary clinton s five year plan might be but what about the five year plan for trump is there even one we can say this much even if trump is elected he s unlikely to gun for a second term and that s not just because of how chaotic the first term would be he would already be history s oldest first term president to take office and for all the comparisons to mussolini trump has never betrayed a love of politics or lust for political power he has also hinted at a one term maximum a few weeks ago after ted cruz refused to endorse trump in cleveland trump suggested that an endorsement would have left cruz in better shape for four years from now that adds up only if a you think you ll lose or b one term is your limit trump has flirted with financial disaster before and he might be doing so again if that s the case he s either thinking about how to pull out of the dive or if it s too late how to spin the coming crash that s only small comfort to trump s enemies of course presidents can do a lot in a short span george w bush managed to pack budget deficits abm treaty withdrawal two wars guantanamo and abu ghraib into one busy term but true tyrants start politics young and stick around forever or at least until they re executed and hung upside down in milan trump is starting too late for that sort of career if he wins trump is clear on two points he intends to build a border wall and he ll push to revisit trade agreements beyond that he is vague given how few efforts trump has made to bone up on policy so far he probably plans to listen to advisors for a few minutes and wing it in foreign policy the realm in which he frightens people most trump is a question mark perhaps also unto himself he rejects interventionism in theory but shows none of the self control and coolness that such a stance requires in the face of inevitable foreign provocations and he seems to have eschewed non interventionists as advisors he might like to put together a peace deal for israel but there are few signs that he thinks about it much given his ego and his business interests trump has probably been thinking as much about a post loss future as a post victory one that s especially likely if he s in financial trouble a real possibility trump s cheapness so fanatical that only repeated prodding by a journalist could get him to honor a million dollar charitable pledge that trump claimed he d already paid suggests there is something more than ordinary cost consciousness at work he has flirted with financial disaster before and he might be doing so again if that s the case he s either thinking about how to pull out of the dive or if it s too late how to spin the coming crash there is widespread speculation stemming from my colleague sarah ellison s great reporting that trump is planning to launch a cable network or news outlet or even running for that purpose now nobody not even trump would go through the hell of running a presidential race simply to start a television network but starting a cable network might at least allow trump to salvage some money and dignity after his loss a new cable channel wouldn t be a goal as much as a consolation prize if one that s more expensive than a typical decorative bowl whatever trump s five year plan may be it s now clear that it includes the possibility of defeat that s why bannon is in and manafort is out losing big is a humiliation but a quixotic defeat is much less of one being a bold ideologue made barry goldwater a hero despite winning only six states in 1964 while being a cautious establishment type made michael dukakis a has been despite winning 10 states in 1988 using the language of a movement helps you save face you can more easily say i lost but our cause continues in this case with the upswing in nationalism around the globe it s probably even true trumpism has a future and it might be brighter without trump will be used in accordance with our privacy policy more from vanity fair contact 2020 cond nast all rights reserved use of this
