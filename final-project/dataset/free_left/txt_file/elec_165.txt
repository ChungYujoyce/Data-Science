unique religious journey is causing him trouble with voters by michael kruse january 22 2016 michael kruse is a senior staff writer for politico the tuesday night before this past thanksgiving at a dinner in a small ballroom at the holiday inn at the airport in des moines one of the 50 or so pastors who had come to listen to marco rubio stood up to ask him a question kenney linhart the broad built boss of a nearby church called the kathedral had read about the complicated religious history of the florida senator and republican presidential hopeful he needed a straight answer you re in a room full of christians linhart said wrapping his hand around the hand of the man holding the microphone so you mentioned god and you mentioned the king of kings but tell us about your experience with the lord jesus christ using that name advertisement yes sir said rubio dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie standing behind an unfussy hotel lectern rubio has perhaps the most unusual personal religious story of anyone on the campaign trail given the audience this might have been an opportunity for evasion or to cherrypick parts of his faith journey that would appeal most to evangelicals instead rubio launched into a virtuoso 10 minute long let me at it telling of his circuitous faith catholicism to mormonism back to catholicism to a southern baptist convention affiliated evangelical megachurch and finally back to catholicism as well as passionate and particular evidence of the depth of his knowledge of the bible now i sound like the preacher a smiling rubio said toward the end his answer was a big deal it was watched shared and talked about in churches around iowa and among pastors around the country and linhart who had supported louisiana governor bobby jindal before that candidacy withered heard what he needed to hear he is now backing rubio i make it clear to my congregation i m not going to tell you who to vote for but this is who i m supporting he said later when we talked on the phone for the staunchly protestant evangelicals though who form a core component of the iowa primary electorate that answer also contained a poison pill i m fully theologically doctrinally aligned with the roman catholic church rubio had said and for people like joe brown the influential leader of the marion avenue baptist church in rural washington in the southeastern part of the state that no wiggle room declaration was a deal breaker most pastors and evangelicals do not believe you can be a catholic and be an evangelical at the same time brown told me he is energetic in his support for ted cruz the texas senator and rubio rival marco rubio prays after an event in iowa his circuitous path to faith catholicism to mormonism back to catholicism to a southern baptist convention affiliated evangelical megachurch and finally back to catholicism has cost him many evangelical votes eric teetsel rubio campaign the main knock on rubio as a candidate is his slipperiness on issues like immigration and when he talks in speeches debates and town halls he can come off polished to the point of rehearsed his religion is an exception when he talks about his faith he sounds off the cuff sincere rubio pitches himself too as the most 21st century candidate and he means generationally he is only 44 and demographically the child of two cuban immigrants he would be the first hispanic president but with americans increasingly moving from church to church blurring long drawn lines between denominations the single most 21st century thing about him might be his religious path and yet in national polls and in polls in iowa rubio trails not only cruz the doctrinaire son of a baptist pastor but donald trump the twice divorced former casino tycoon who has said he doesn t ask for forgiveness for his sins and who totes a bible as a prop the problem here in iowa if it is a problem with the kick off caucuses a week and a half away is not so much that rubio is pandering for the votes of evangelicals or that he s insufficiently authentic on this front it s that he s entirely authentic and it isn t that he hasn t picked a religion and stuck with it for some it s that he has and that he picked wrong in this state that skews conservative white and old the question is paramount but it s no less crucial across the rest of the country where politics and religion combine in shifting consequential ways rubio who has never lost an election is manifestly ambitious a baby faced step skipping climber ever since he got on the city commission of the tiny municipality of west miami when he was 26 years old his religious life on the other hand stands apart he has been a seeker and a searcher he has struggled always he has said to balance what he wants in this life with what he wants from the next but rubio wants to be saved more than he wants to be president and the former could cost him the latter he grew up west of miami s little havana down the street from a catholic church where he was baptized and went to mass with his mother after which he has said he sometimes would wrap himself in a sheet and play priest by mimicking the services when his family moved to north las vegas in 1979 they went to a mormon church because of one of his aunts and i immersed myself in lds theology rubio wrote in his memoir and understood it as well as an eight year old mind can his father didn t much like the mormon religion because of its bans on smoking he loved cigars and drinking he worked as a bartender and caffeine cuban coffee his mother meanwhile sought friends and shared values more than a particular theology or ideology in an american son rubio portrayed himself even as a boy and pre teen as the most devout member of his family he checked out from his school library books about religion from his parents he got for a christmas gift a set of world book encyclopedias and he flipped to the pages about roman catholicism he watched the papal easter mass on television and decided he wanted to be catholic again the rubios left their mormon church mostly at my instigation he wrote and their return to catholicism had really just been my decision he got his parents to enroll him in ccd the children s education program of the roman catholic church football and religion those were his things one of his cousins told manuel roig franzia for his book the rise of marco rubio he was married on october 17 1998 in a catholic church the church of the little flower in coral gables florida the start of his political life though coincided with a decline in his religious life he got busy and he got lazy he has said and lapsed considerably in my spiritual responsibilities to my family he wrote in an american son up in tallahassee after rubio was elected to the state legislature he focused on achieving increased prominence and power down in miami his wife filled a vacuum by taking their children to christ fellowship baptist charismatic and evangelical rubio followed by 2003 he has said christ fellowship was their regular church their church home but in 2004 and 2005 as he positioned himself to be the state speaker of the house he returned to catholicism he yearned for his roots he went to mass every morning he subscribed to the catholic publication magnificat he craved literally he would write the most blessed sacrament holy communion the sacramental point of contact between the catholic and the liturgy of heaven he liked the contemporary gospel message the simplicity of the focus on the scriptures of christ fellowship but what he really wanted and needed he thought was the actual body and blood of jesus his period of toggling between denominations was over so was any ambivalence about his faith just listen to his last speech as the speaker of the florida house this was in may of 2008 let me finish with one more thought and this is just the truth and i hope no one gets offended no one should rubio said and that is this he took a sip of ice water from a styrofoam cup seeming to gird himself with rubio now seeking the oval office it s odd perhaps to think that this might have been his last statement as a politician all he knew for sure then was that term limits meant he was headed home to miami to be a lawyer as a public figure in a public sphere rubio wanted to get this out god is real he said marco rubio with his parents on his wedding day october 17 1998 to jeanette dousdebes in florida the ceremony was catholic at the church of the little flower in coral gables while he was a state legislator his wife filled a vacuum by taking their children to the baptist christ fellowship rubio followed by 2003 he has said christ fellowship was their regular church their church home marco rubio his voice quaked with emotion he used his right index finger to point around the room at his fellow lawmakers god is real he said again i don t care what courts across the country say was he about to cry i don t care what laws we pass god is real you can t pass a court ruling that s going to keep god out of this building you can t a year and a half later when he was running for u s senate so effectively he chased charlie crist from the republican party rubio talked to a reporter for catholicadvocate com roe v wade he said is morally and constitutionally wrong and should be overturned and marriage is between a man and woman he promised he was not going to change with the polls or the times with success came scrutiny and an interesting paradox as his faith got more specific and intense reporters and voters had more questions and doubts rubio was described in a story in world magazine a christian publication as a roman catholic whose family has spent the last six years attending a miami area nondenominational church the morning of election day in 2010 he went to mass in coral gables and that evening in his victory speech he said let me begin tonight by acknowledging a simple but profound truth we are all children of a powerful and great god a catholic florida state law student and blogger named eric giunta wondered though was rubio trying to court both the catholic and the evangelical votes he added catholics do not like to hear that one of their political heroes is a defector from their religion and evangelicals especially southern baptists would not be too happy to hear that their hero is an idol worshiper i e a catholic eric geiger at the time the executive pastor of christ fellowship told the new york times rubio still came very regularly to worship service at the church to which from 2005 to 2008 he donated 50 000 a headline in the national catholic reporter inquired is senator elect marco rubio a catholic what was he people in the context of politics were asking a question that in some sense missed the larger point rubio in this respect actually embodied national trends the pew research center last year published an exhaustive study of religion in america one of its primary findings switching religions is a common occurrence in the united states the report cited a remarkable degree of churn in the u s religious landscape this sort of religious practice is becoming more common due to increasing interfaith marriages geographic mobility and declining brand loyalty among denominations john c green a senior fellow with the pew forum on religion and public life told me rubio said denny burk the head of the center for gospel and culture in louisville is not unlike many americans who over the course of their lives have more than one affiliation with a church or denomination people intermarry people change jobs people move around the country people change from man to woman r r reno a former professor of theology and ethics at creighton university who now is the editor of first things magazine the same fluidity is present in the religious world as well in this respect said thomas s kidd the associate director of the institute for studies of religion at baylor university and a member of rubio s religious liberty advisory board rubio represents a typical religious model of 21st century america denominational distinctions aside said eric teetsel rubio s campaign s faith outreach director rubio will make decisions consistent with a christian worldview informed by the bible and guided by prayer in his 2012 interview with christianity today he said i ve never criticized anyone for having their faith influence their public policy decisions if your faith is real burning inside of you it s going to influence the way you view everything in his speech at that summer s republican national convention in tampa he said faith in our creator is the most important american value of all in 2013 when time put rubio on its cover calling him the republican savior he had a ready response there s only one savior rubio tweeted and it is not me and last august in a conversation with russell moore the president of the ethics and religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention rubio said people that stand for the idea that you should be able to abort a child at any stage in the pregnancy they re the extremists he added that christians are called to influence the culture around us rubio isn t a religious political panderer he s a 21st century evangelical catholic patricia miller wrote in october on religiondispatches org so in iowa just before thanksgiving from behind the lectern at the hotel at the airport in des moines rubio made his case to those pastors i think too many catholics don t fully understand their faith and the result is i didn t learn about the catholic church until i went to a non catholic church he said and became infused in the bible and became infused in the written word of god and then and only then did the liturgy of the church start even making sense i started to begin to understand the richness of the church his relationship with jesus christ god became a man came down to earth and died for our sins he said why go to mass but nonetheless maintain that affiliation with christ fellowship because they preach from the same bible as for the implicit question of whether or not that s even ok i think one of the amazing things that s happened over the last 15 years for a lot of different reasons is some of the denominational divisions in america have fallen away as more and more believers recognize that we are all facing a common challenge i wanted to know whether the pastors bought it i called around to those who had been at the dinner or had watched the footage from the christian broadcasting network iowa as a first electoral challenge is tricky in part because the evangelical vote is no monolith and different pastors have different beliefs and their determinations aren t just about religious dogma the pastors i talked to spoke a good bit about rubio s one time willingness to work on immigration reform as part of the bipartisan gang of eight huge red flag said spencer keroff the pastor at the first church of the open bible in des moines i know we have to take some immigrants added chris tjapkes the pastor of first baptist church in perry but we have too many people in the country now who aren t working they spoke about his denominational drift it is quite a spiritual journey which he s certainly entitled to said darran whiting the pro cruz pastor at liberty baptist church in marion before adding it s not something i relate to they spoke about his catholicism the roman catholic church does not teach salvation by grace through faith said caleb garraway an evangelist in eastern iowa and also a cruz backer am i trying to say marco rubio is not saved i have no idea i hope the man is as a child rubio second from left back row and pictured in 1980 joined the church of jesus christ of latter day saints with his family in las vegas ap photo i would not say anything derogatory about catholics but marco rubio is very open that he is part of the catholic church said brown the marion avenue baptist pastor who has spearheaded the effort to get pastors in all 99 of iowa s counties to endorse cruz when you say you re doctrinally aligned with the catholic church it really is contrary to what most evangelicals in iowa believe royce phillips the pastor of tabernacle baptist church in coralville told me rubio s answer in des moines surprised him and impressed him he seemed genuine he said but that he remains uncommitted i d prefer a baptist president he explained i would say wayne almlie the pastor at st paul lutheran church in des moines told me most of my christian friends do support ted cruz it s not so much what s wrong with marco rubio it s what s right about ted cruz said bob vander plaats the president of the iowa based family leader a social conservative organization it s a state of some 3 million people more than 92 percent of them are white pew research center statistics say 53 percent of them say religion is very important and 51 percent of them say they read the bible seldom or never two of every three people in iowa don t believe in evolution from november to december to january based on quinnipiac polling rubio s standing with white born again evangelicals ticked up but only from eight to 12 to 13 percent his campaign made an ad called faith aimed squarely at iowa s evangelicals our goal is eternity rubio said into the camera the ability to live alongside our creator for all time to accept the free gift of salvation offered to us by jesus christ the free gift of salvation an evangelical dog whistle miller from religiondispatches org told me on the phone he s fully aligned with the catholic church said burk from louisville but he expresses himself in evangelical terms bilingual and not just because of his spanish still though he is trailing cruz by a lot and trump too who dishes out lines like these i even brought my bible the evangelicals ok i walked onto a stage with a bible everybody likes me better i called michael cromartie the vice president of the ethics and public policy center and an expert on the intersection of evangelicals and civic life it s befuddling he told me i think i m as puzzled as any rubio adviser would be this past sunday i went to church at linhart s kathedral in des moines not far from the city center it s an old building he and his congregation are fixing up the backdrop for the service was some scaffolding and the space smelled like fresh paint the faces around the room showed a surprising amount of black and brown skin linhart preached for more than an hour he paused in the middle listen he said you ve got bernie sanders and you ve got hillary clinton and you ve got marco rubio and you ve got ted cruz and donald something and you know what they re all good speakers you ve got to know what their relationship with the lord jesus christ is like i m not going to tell you who to vote for he said god s bigger than that amen two hours southeast past truck stops silos and so many peeled paint barns in snow crusted fields i arrived for evening worship at marion avenue baptist it s a brick fortress that sits on the main drag of a downtrodden town inside in the pastor s office brown had a big box of t shirts that told people to choose cruz he preached to his people to not squander their responsibility come the night of the caucuses i think everybody here knows who i m caucusing for he said adding quickly that they were free to support somebody else as long as it s not bernie sanders people laughed amen somebody said the story of rubio s religious identity doesn t lie in iowa though it lies in florida in the two churches where his family regularly worships miami is this country s most multicultural mishmash of a metropolitan area a pan american capital distinctions exist but hard lines go soft in the heat and it s not unusual to pick and choose among churches for all rubio s clarity about his theology however i found he has left some uncertainty in his trail there are two very different sets of people here who believe rubio is in their congregation the two churches rubio and his family go to are separated by approximately four miles of strip malls and strip clubs and smoke shops and pawn shops and liquor stores and auto lots and an international house of pancakes on car clogged u s 1 i spent a weekend plus a monday morning going to eight services at st louis catholic church and christ fellowship the differences aren t just theological theater seats versus wooden pews hands up palms open versus heads bowed eyes closed candle flames versus stage lights and bouncy breathy christian rock versus organ tunes white robes versus skinny jeans at christ fellowship with thousands in its flock seven locations around the city and a lead pastor rick blackwood a compelling preacher whose sermons have advocated creationism exorcisms and anti gay beliefs awesome wow what great singing at st louis catholic church the repetitive body of christ the murmurs of restive children at christ fellowship i heard geiger the former executive pastor back to guest preach talk to the congregation packed in balcony too about two kinds of liars he had a name for the second the second liar geiger said minimizes the holiness of god by saying i don t ever need forgiveness i don t have any sin i m a good person i m a good person we had a presidential candidate recently someone asked him do you ever pray for forgiveness for those who might not have known he spelled it out donald trump and he said no i just try to make it right i try to fix things which many people actually think i can fix things i can make things right i can fix things myself no he said you can t fix things you can t fix things because god is holy god is righteous and you re not at st louis catholic church i heard prayers for sincere dialogue of men and women of different faiths and that it will produce fruits of peace and justice and for the grace of the holy spirit to overcome divisions among christians and for understanding and respect for those whose culture beliefs or traditions are different from our own in both churches i talked to people who had no problem that rubio and his family attend services at both churches i wouldn t say it s too unusual matt gutierrez told me at christ fellowship a lot of us do that toni mamert told me at st louis catholic church we practice our catholic faith but we can go for the word of god and study the word of god at another denomination in both churches i talked to people who did i d like to find one place in my opinion cole peacock told me at christ fellowship i would never go to a protestant church for my sunday obligation only mass patricia desbiens told me at st louis catholic church and in both churches i talked to people who didn t know rubio also went to another church i wasn t aware of that javier cruz said at st louis catholic church i thought this was his church pamela clark said at christ fellowship after a service at christ fellowship i talked with sammy flores the church s main campus pastor blackwood declined a request to talk about rubio but flores told me he hadn t seen him since he started running for president he had seen his wife and children more recently he said christmas eve maybe rubio s attendance is consistent at st louis catholic church he worships here the rev dr james dugard a deacon told me he comes to mass if he s in town he s here with his family sometimes a little late but seated in the center rear pew present there s a fulfillment he gets from the charismatic side of the protestant movement the rev michael garcia said after a st louis service but he also i guess you could say more intellectually he is a very intellectual person he gets fulfillment here in the catholic church what in particular i asked does rubio get from the catholic church that he doesn t at christ fellowship sacraments garcia said what greater gift can you offer but god himself this past monday the day donald trump at liberty university referred tellingly to 2 corinthians as two corinthians and assured the crowd his autobiography the art of the deal was a deep deep second to the bible on the list of the best books ever marco rubio was hosting a town hall at the waverly country club in waverly iowa toward the end of the session rubio got a question from an atheist would he the man wanted to know be a pastor in chief or a commander in chief the question came off as an effort to make rubio pick between the faith he has and the job he wants it didn t work as he had in his farewell speech in tallahassee and at the dinner with the pastors in des moines he saw an opportunity and took it i m a christian he said i want to be very clear about something not only am i a christian and not only am i influenced by my faith but it is the single greatest influence in my life and from that i ll never hide and i ll tell you why because i know that if i m lucky i get to live to be 85 or 90 but i m more interested in eternity and the ability to live forever with my creator that you don t believe in but i do and that s what i aspire to more than anything else california by jeremy b white updated 05 08 20 09 44 pm edt by sam sutton and carly sitrin by bill mahoney and josh gerstein updated 03 29 20 02 48 pm edt 2020
