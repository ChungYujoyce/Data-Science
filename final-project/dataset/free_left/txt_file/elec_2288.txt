advertisement supported by by trip gabriel pella iowa after nonstop candidate traffic in iowa for a full year the gun was sounded on the final lap before the feb 1 caucuses as the leading candidates in both parties crisscrossed the snowy plains and the state s largest newspaper announced its endorsements the des moines register backed senator marco rubio of florida for the republicans giving welcome news for a candidate who has been trailing donald j trump and senator ted cruz in iowa polls and hillary clinton for the democrats who is in a tight race with senator bernie sanders of vermont and in a move that was less than an endorsement but perhaps even more significant iowa s senior elected republican senator charles e grassley shared a stage with donald j trump here in pella standing behind a trump sign on a podium the appearance conferred a seal of approval by elements of the republican establishment that once declined to take mr trump seriously and is now beginning to see him as preferable to mr cruz a hard line conservative i m happy to be here with such an enthusiastic group and this candidate mr grassley said mr trump reciprocated later saying this is a great guy this is a great guy as photographers snapped pictures of the unlikely pairing he s respected by everybody at an rally earlier saturday mr trump joked that he was so impervious to attacks including charges by rivals that he was not a true conservative that he could shoot people in the middle of fifth avenue without losing support his remark came in for angry rebuke from glenn beck the right wing radio host who campaigned in iowa with mr cruz on saturday this kind of hubris mr beck said gravely referring to mr trump is beyond imagination throughout the gathering mr cruz and mr beck alluded to the left leaning positions taken by mr trump for much of his life nobody on earth ever grew a backbone after they got into 1600 pennsylvania avenue mr cruz said is there any chance on earth that individual would actually stand up to the cronyism and cartel in washington for his part mr trump raised doubts about mr cruz s eligibility to serve because of his canadian birth and about an unreported loan he took from goldman sachs to finance a senate race you got to pick a winner because i m the only one who s going to win he told iowans referring to the general election in endorsing mr rubio the register sought an alternative to the two leading republicans in the race who each engender hostility from large parts of their party republicans have the opportunity to define their party s future in this election the paper wrote they could choose anger pessimism and fear or they could take a different path the editors wrote it called mr rubio his party s best hope for enlarging the republican tent and called him whip smart about policy matters in meetings with editors the paper s once highly anticipated backing is less meaningful in an age of reduced print circulation and the hogging of the news cycle by a candidate mr trump whose often insulting tweets are followed by nearly 6 million people and whose rallies are covered live on cable tv for mr rubio however it may offer a bounce if establishment leaning republicans who dislike mr trump and mr cruz and so far have been divided among several candidates start to coalesce behind the florida senator speaking to about 250 people in indianola iowa about an hour after the register announced its endorsement mr rubio did not revel in it only after a questioner congratulated him for it did he say jokingly i d rather have your endorsement i m grateful for it he added but i still want you to caucus for me he seemed to have taken some of the newspaper editorial s advice to heart as he gave one of his more upbeat campaign speeches recently though it spoke glowingly of him the register s article also chided the senator known for his optimistic message of american exceptionalism and renewal for offering a darker assessment about the country s prospects lately he has pandered to rising pessimism in his party he talks gloomily about a nation in decline the editorial said on saturday evening he was lighter on the gloom america he said is the greatest country in the history of the world he added we don t say that enough mrs clinton was the paper s pick ahead of the 2008 caucuses as well when she finished a disappointing third behind barack obama and john edwards the paper wrote mrs clinton is not a perfect candidate but it noted the presidency is not an entry level position although it praised mrs clinton s chief rival senator bernie sanders for injecting the issue of income inequality into the races in both parties the paper hesitated over the near impossibility mr sanders would face in getting his sweeping programs through congress mrs clinton has been making the same argument particularly about mr sanders s proposal for universal health care she says a wiser course is to improve on president obama s affordable care act recognizing the power of mr sanders s idea though she has taken to reminding people of her own attempts to create universal health care during her husband s administration now before it was called obamacare it was called hillarycare as some of you might remember mrs clinton said at a town hall style event in clinton iowa on saturday the second time in recent days she has used the line we share the same goal universal health care for every single american mrs clinton said of her rival but we have a real difference about how to get there mr sanders who began a weekend bus tour of eastern iowa cities and towns on saturday began the day speaking to more than 150 supporters who hollered and stomped their feet in his davenport campaign office before heading out to canvass mr sanders who has begun to resemble mr trump in his penchant for citing positive polls maintained that in head to head matchups with mr trump he outshined mrs clinton pointing out that former president bill clinton has stepped up attacking him calling him angry mr sanders embraced the distinction and you know what he said it is true i am angry and the american people are
