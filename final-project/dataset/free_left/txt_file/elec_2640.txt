advertisement supported by by ashley parker and amy chozick gettysburg pa donald j trump came to this historic battlefield town saturday to offer his vision for america s future saying he hoped to heal the divisions of the country as president lincoln tried to do here seven score and 13 years ago yet in his own gettysburg address mr trump who has been sliding in the polls less than three weeks before election day did not offer much in the way of race changing oratory and did not seem to embrace lincoln s unifying ambition instead the republican nominee used the first third of what had been promoted as a closing argument speech to nurse personal grievances grumbling about the rigging of this election and the dishonest mainstream media and threatening to sue the women who have come forward an 11th woman did on saturday to accuse him of aggressive sexual advances every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign total fabrication mr trump said the events never happened never all of these liars will be sued after the election is over and the more substantive part of the speech intended to outline his first 100 days in office if he were elected president did not quite live up to its billing by campaign aides who had promised a major policy address not unlike newt gingrich s 1994 contract with america instead a subdued mr trump who on friday acknowledged the possibility of electoral defeat largely repeated his existing campaign promises from renegotiating trade deals to enforcing tougher immigration laws mr trump s carefully scripted presentation on saturday was meant to project a new level of forethought and seriousness from a man not usually associated with either his proposals had legislative titles like the affordable child care and elder care act and the repeal and replace obamacare act the speech before a small handpicked crowd was also a recognition that mr trump needs to establish himself as someone with the discipline and temperament to lead the nation hillary clinton is not running against me she s running against change he said and she s running against all of the american people and all of the american voters mr trump did offer specific immigration proposals including an end illegal immigration act that would establish mandatory minimum prison sentences for undocumented immigrants caught illegally re entering the country after deportation he also said he would stop issuing visas to any country that refused to take in citizens ordered deported from the united states a policy that would almost certainly disrupt immigration and commerce with china which is one such country mr trump also reiterated his promise to build a border wall with mexico and have mexico pay for it though he hedged a bit saying the country of mexico will be reimbursing the united states for the full cost of such a wall at a rally in cleveland later on saturday his most energetic of the day mr trump was back to leading his crowd in chants calling for mexico to pay for the wall repeating earlier pledges to drain the swamp in washington mr trump promised to push through a series of new ethics laws as well as term limits for both the house and senate and he called for a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the federal work force through attrition exempting military public safety and public health mr trump has a long history of threatening and occasionally following through on litigation and in raising the possibility of suing his female accusers he may have simply been trying to stop more from coming forward at a news conference on saturday in los angeles jessica drake an adult film actress claimed that after meeting mr trump at a 2006 charity golf event in lake tahoe nev she had accepted an invitation to meet in his hotel room not wanting to go alone ms drake said she was accompanied by a couple of female friends 13 photos view slide show ms drake who appeared saturday with the women s rights lawyer gloria allred said mr trump had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission after returning to her room ms drake said mr trump or a man phoning on his behalf offered her 10 000 to return to his room which she declined in a statement the trump campaign called the accusation another example of the clinton campaign trying to rig the election mr trump does not know this person does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her it said aboard her campaign plane mrs clinton said i saw where our opponent donald trump went to gettysburg one of the most extraordinary places in american history and basically said if he s president he ll spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior she added i m going to keep talking about what we want to do what we think the country deserves from the next president and vice president and when it comes right down to it i think that s what people are going to vote on at her rally saturday in pennsylvania mrs clinton devoted much of her remarks to the state s contentious senate race giving an extended plug to the democratic candidate katie mcginty and attacking the republican incumbent senator patrick j toomey for not denouncing mr trump for his vulgar remarks about women captured in a recording a bloomberg news poll conducted this month after the release of the tape showed mrs clinton with a nine percentage point lead over mr trump in pennsylvania on saturday she tried to offer an olive branch to the white working class voters there who have gravitated to mr trump you probably know people who are thinking about voting for donald trump she told the crowd of 1 800 gathered in a high school gymnasium here s what i want you to tell them tell them that i understand they need a president who cares about them will listen to them and i want to be their president too after his appearance in gettysburg mr trump reverted to his trusted stump speech in back to back rallies in virginia beach and cleveland exciting large crowds by attacking mrs clinton and promising to bring back jobs you re going to look back at this rally and you re going to remember it for the rest of your life because this will be the beginning he said in virginia you re going to remember nov 8 because your country is going to be a country that starts winning again advertisement
