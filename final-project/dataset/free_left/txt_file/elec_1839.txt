trump found a flaw in our political system and we have no way to fix it as the constitutional convention of 1787 ended ben franklin walked out of philadelphia s independence hall to find an anxious crowd according to a diary entry recorded by james mchenry a signatory to the constitution a woman from philadelphia was the first to speak to franklin well doctor she asked what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic franklin famously replied if you can keep it perhaps we cannot this reads like hyperbole but is it consider for a moment the knife s edge on which the republic rests the election is 24 hours away as i write this donald trump is 1 8 points behind hillary clinton in the realclearpolitics polling average and here is what we know of donald trump he is a man who routinely praises dictators of vladimir putin trump said he s running his country and at least he s a leader unlike what we have in this country of kim jong un trump said you ve got to give him credit he goes in he takes over and he s the boss it s incredible of saddam hussein trump said he killed terrorists he did that so good they didn t read them the rights it s not just that trump admires authoritarians it s that the thing he admires about them is their authoritarianism their ability to dispense with niceties like a free press due process and political opposition trump has promised in public and repeatedly to bring this hammer to american governance he stood in a nationally televised debate and vowed to jail his opponent if elected he has proposed strengthening libel laws to make it easier to cow the press and antitrust laws to punish jeff bezos and amazon for the washington post s coverage of his candidacy in a recent speech at gettysburg meant to preview his first 100 days in office trump said he would sue all of the women who accused him of sexual assault during rallies trump has exhorted his followers to assault protestors and has promised to pay their legal fees if their thuggery leads to arrest he has warned that the only way he could lose the election would be if it is rigged and has suggested he may refuse to concede and all this ignores his more basic flaws he is cruel lazy and reckless he knows nothing of policy and has not bothered to find anything out he is easily baited reliant on sycophants and prone to conspiracy theories he is a bigot who slimed an american born judge for his mexican heritage and a misogynist who boasted that his celebrity gave him license to commit sexual assault he has cast doubt on america s commitment to the nato alliance and offhandedly encouraged saudi arabia and japan to build nuclear weapons his business is rife with conflicts of interest and his campaign has been amateurish and poorly managed here is the compliment i can pay donald trump and i pay it with real gratitude he never hid who he was perhaps he lacked the self control or the self awareness whatever the reason he never obscured his authoritarian tendencies his will to power his sexism his greed his dishonesty his racism his thirst for vengeance and he is still only 1 8 points behind it is likely though not certain that hillary clinton will win on tuesday but even if she does here is what must be said of american politics in 2016 we came within inches of electing donald j trump president of the united states of america we did this even knowing exactly what he stood for exactly what he had threatened to do exactly what kind of man he was a narrow trump loss is another way of saying a near trump win a 3 point victory for clinton implies that if trump were merely a bit more self disciplined if he had not bragged about sexual assault while wearing a microphone if his opponent s pneumonia had lingered a bit longer america would be ruled by a cruel narcissist with authoritarian ambitions it will mean that if unemployment were a few percentage points higher if the man who murdered two police officers last week had been brown rather than white if trump s odd bedfellows alliance of russian hackers and angry fbi agents had been a bit more effective trump would have won perhaps on tuesday we will dodge the bullet but we will still need to understand how we came to be standing in front of a gun there is a comforting and popular explanation for trump s rise he is the product of an extraordinary period of economic pain demographic anxiety and elite backlash this argument holds that the condition of the country or at least the condition of trump s supporters is catastrophic and trump s rise is a response to the suffering this is reassuring it makes trump into a kind of political natural disaster a hurricane that relied on a rare alignment of winds and rains and warmth a combination that occurs once in lifetime and can be forgotten once it s been survived but there is nothing in polls of national attitudes or indicators of economic health that reveals this moment as uniquely fertile for the rise of a strongman in 1992 when pat buchanan ran for president on a trump like platform unemployment was higher consumer confidence was lower and americans reported themselves more dissatisfied with the state of the country but buchanan lost handily and as we have learned more about trump s supporters and have come to understand more about the year in which he rose these explanations have grown more and more strained the belief that trump is a predictable reaction to acute economic duress crumbled before the finding that his primary voters had a median household income of 72 000 well above both the national average and that of clinton supporters the idea that trumpism arose as a response to a stalled economy collapsed as america experienced its longest sustained run of private sector job growth and the highest single year jump in median incomes in modern history the idea that trump was a reaction to failed trade deals and heavy competition from immigrants slammed into data showing support for him showed no relationship to lost manufacturing jobs and was strongest in areas without immigrant labor the idea that trump is a reaction to historic disgust with american elites is at war with president barack obama s approval ratings which have risen above 50 percent and now match ronald reagan s at this point in his presidency the reality is that the patterns of trumpism the trends of the us economy and the polls measuring the american mood have stubbornly refused to fit the comforting theory that this is an extraordinary candidacy that could only emerge in an extraordinary moment indeed if this were a period as thick with economic pain and anti establishment sentiment as the pundits pretend trump s victory would likely be assured once you appreciate that fact the lesson of trumpism becomes much scarier we are more vulnerable than we thought to reactionary strongmen it can happen here to americans of another era particularly the founding era it would seem bizarre that we are reaching so far and straining so hard to explain the popular appeal of a charismatic demagogue as former bush speechwriter michael gerson wrote the founders had little patience for pure democracy which they found particularly vulnerable to demagogues men of factious tempers of local prejudices or of sinister designs says federalist 10 may by intrigue by corruption or by other means first obtain the suffrages and then betray the interests of the people a representative government is designed to frustrate sinister majorities or committed pluralities by mediating public views through a chosen body of citizens whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country the american political system is structured the way it is in part due to the founders fear of demagogues it s a reason why the american presidency is so weak why the executive is checked by other branches why the senate s members were originally selected by state legislators it is a credit to the long success of our political institutions that we think dangerous men can only win elections in far off lands and so it is the weakening of those institutions that demands our attention now donald trump s nearness to the presidency rests on two separate accomplishments or if you prefer two separate institutional failures that are often conflated the first is his victory in the republican party s presidential primaries the second is his consolidation of elite republicans and of the republican leaning electorate trump won the gop primaries with 13 8 million votes the distance between those 13 8 million voters and the more than 60 million votes he is expected to receive tomorrow is vast and was far from assured in 1972 for instance george mcgovern won the democratic primary even though much of the democratic party viewed him with suspicion and even fear major democratic interest groups like the afl cio refused to endorse him in the general election and top democrats including former governors of florida texas and virginia organized democrats for nixon mcgovern went on to lose with less than 40 percent of the vote a dismal showing driven by democrats who abandoned a nominee they considered unacceptable a similar path was possible for trump elites within the republican party viewed him with horror his primary opponents spoke of him in apocalyptic terms ted cruz called trump a pathological liar utterly amoral and a narcissist at a level i don t think this country s ever seen rick perry said trump s candidacy was a cancer on conservatism and it must be clearly diagnosed excised and discarded rand paul said trump is a delusional narcissist and an orange faced windbag a speck of dirt is way more qualified to be president marco rubio called him dangerous and warned that we should not hand the nuclear codes of the united states to an erratic individual and then every single one of those republicans endorsed trump ted cruz told americans to vote for the pathological liar rick perry urged people to elect the cancer on conservatism rand paul backed the delusional narcissist marco rubio campaigned to hand the nuclear codes of the united states to an erratic individual the list goes on paul ryan the republican speaker of the house of representatives has endorsed trump as has mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader and reince priebus the head of the republican national committee mike pence the governor of indiana commiserated with dan senor a former bush appointee over the fact that trump was unacceptable and then became his vice president with this kind of elite consolidation it s little wonder that trump has managed to consolidate republican leaning voters behind him the final nbc wsj poll of the election found that 82 percent of likely republican voters were supporting trump precisely matching the 82 percent of likely democratic voters supporting clinton trump did not get mcgoverned there are two analyses that must be made of this the first is moral there are many republicans who honestly believe trump will make a good or at least adequate president their endorsement of his candidacy is perfectly honorable even if i think it wrongheaded but many of the republicans mentioned here believe trump is a threat to world peace and to fundamental norms values and institutions of american democracy their endorsements of his candidacy will stain the rest of their careers and if he is elected and if the worst comes to pass they will be remembered by history for their abandonment of country the second analysis that must be made is structural and believe it or not that s where things get scary political scientist julia azari has written the single most important sentence for understanding both trump s rise and this dangerous era in american politics the defining characteristic of our moment is that parties are weak while partisanship is strong here is the problem in short parties and particularly the republican party can no longer control whom they nominate but once they nominate someone once they nominate anyone that person is guaranteed the support of both the party s elites and its voters unlike in mcgovern s day when ticket splitting was common any candidate able to win his party s presidential primaries can now count on his party s support and so has a damn good chance of winning the presidency political parties and political party primaries were traditionally bulwarks against demagogues rising in american politics they were controlled by gatekeepers who acted as checks against charismatic demagogues donald trump would never have made it through the convention horse trading that used to drive nominations he would never have survived a process that required support from party officials but in recent decades we have slowly destroyed the ability of party officials to drive party primaries what s more we have come to see party officials exercising influence as fundamentally illegitimate political scientists think of parties as the fundamental building blocks of democracy and people think of them as the impediment to democracy says hans noel a political scientist at georgetown university in other systems you wouldn t even have primaries the whole thing would happen at a party convention but here when the dnc makes choices that influence the outcome of a primary that looks undemocratic the results have been stark the reigning political science theory of primaries going into this election was known as the party decides and it stated basically that party elites controlled primary outcomes by driving money media attention and endorsements no single idea has been as decisively wrecked by 2016 as that one and when you examine the reasons for its failure you see they are unlikely to end with trump money turned out to be much less important to winning primaries than anyone thought just ask jeb bush who spent 130 million only to be humiliated even as trump spent almost nothing to win moreover the internet keeps making it easier to fundraise off an energized base a dynamic that is empowering high enthusiasm outsider candidates like bernie sanders and ted cruz and weakening party establishments and the big dollar donors they control similarly parties used to drive media attention by signaling to reporters which candidates to take seriously but that process too has been democratized social media makes it easy to communicate with supporters directly and made it more valuable for audience hungry media outlets to cover the candidates with intense fan bases that send stories viral across facebook or reddit that again favors exciting outsiders with enthusiastic supporters over vetted establishment grinds but the primary resource party officials have when influencing primary elections is the trust of voters that s why endorsements are important and have traditionally been predictive of the eventual winner they represent party officials using the credibility they have built with their voters to persuade them of whom to vote for trump didn t have any republican endorsements to speak of until he had already won a slew of primaries but the void of official support arguably helping him it was proof that he really was untouched and untainted by the unpopular gop establishment this represented the republican party failing at the most basic job of a political party helping its voters make good decisions the gop s elites have so totally lost the faith of their base that their efforts to persuade republican voters were ignored at best and counterproductive at worst but this also presents a puzzle if partisans have lost so much faith in their party establishments then why are they so much likelier to back whomever their party nominates the answer in short is fear and loathing of the other party since 1964 the american national election studies have been asking republicans and democrats to describe their feelings toward the other party on a scale that runs from cold and negative to warm and positive in 1964 31 percent of republicans had cold negative feelings toward the democratic party and 32 percent of democrats had cold negative feelings toward the republican party by 2012 that had risen to 77 percent of republicans and 78 percent of democrats today fully 45 percent of republicans and 41 percent of democrats believe the other party s policies threaten the nation s well being this fear is strongest among the most politically involved which makes sense you re more likely to take an active interest in american politics if you think the stakes are high but that means the people driving american politics and particularly the people driving low turnout party primaries have the most apocalyptic view of the other side this is driven by the reality that the two parties have grown more ideologically distant from each other and so the stakes of elections really have grown larger in 1994 34 percent of republicans were more liberal than the median democrat and 30 percent of democrats were more conservative than the median republican today only 8 percent of republicans are more liberal than the median democrat and only 6 percent of democrats are more conservative than the median republican and polarization begets polarization the angrier and more fearful partisans are the more of a market there is for media that makes them yet angrier and yet more fearful it is no accident that the ceo of breitbart news a hyper ideological conservative media outlet that specializes in scaring the hell out of its audience is leading trump s campaign one reason trump has been able to consolidate republican support is that republican leaning media has convinced itself and its base that the alternative to trump is a criminal who belongs in jail this offers a rationale for voting republican even if you don t particularly like your candidate a majority of trump voters say they are voting against clinton rather than for trump this raises the possibility that trump s support from republicans is merely an artifact of clinton s unpopularity i m skeptical before they had convinced themselves clinton is a criminal many republicans led by trump convinced themselves obama was born in kenya and constitutionally ineligible to serve as president and while those attacks were driving obama s popularity down clinton s numbers were so high that it became fashionable to speculate over whether obama needed to replace joe biden with clinton to win reelection clinton s weaknesses are real but her unpopularity among republicans is structural her four percent approval rating among republicans isn t so far off from the six percent obama registered at the end of the 2012 election we ve got this online media where the profits are driven by controversy and clicks sarah rumpf a former breitbart writer told vox it s just an activism problem in general where it s easier to fundraise and easier to get members when you can declare an emergency when you can declare a crisis when you can identify an enemy this helps explain the unified party support for donald trump republican officeholders are terrified that if they don t support him or are seen as in any way contributing to clinton s election they ll face the wrath of their conservative base and be defeated in the primary challenges that the tea party used to such devastating effect in 2010 and 2012 paul ryan got a taste of this after distancing himself from trump after the release of the access hollywood tape his popularity plummeted and a majority of republicans said they preferred to see trump representing the party than ryan so here then is the key failure point in modern american politics and observing it in action requires looking no further than the republican party voters dislike of their own party has broken the primary process but fear of the opposition has guaranteed unified party support to the nominee that means whoever manages to win a flawed competition dominated by the angriest most terrified partisans ends within spitting distance of the presidency party primaries were traditionally bulwarks against demagogues rising in american politics now they are the method by which they will rise the thing i keep coming back to is the muslim ban says msnbc s chris hayes that was an actual policy he called for while running for president and if you switched in jews for muslims it was immediately clear what it was and it wasn t disqualifying to me that was so so upsetting hayes is the author of the book twilight of the elites and he has spent a lot of time thinking about elite failures and there were elite failures that led to trump the anger left over from the iraq war and from the financial crisis is certainly part of his rise but the other problem with elites this year is harder to talk about they were underpowered the gatekeepers have been extraordinarily diminished hayes says the best example of this to me is the newspaper editorial page it s the ultimate old school gatekeeper i find it so remarkable that the columbus dispatch usa today all these gatekeepers have come to the proper correct conclusion on trump and said no fucking way but no one cares they don t control the gate they can lock the gate and someone can walk around it three feet down the fence elites are often blamed for trump s rise he is said to be the backlash to their failures their corruption their obliviousness their self dealing their cosmopolitanism their condescension all that may be true but past moments in american politics have also featured angry voters out of touch elites and social problems those moments however featured political and media gatekeepers with more power and so trump like candidates were destroyed in primaries or at conventions or by a press that paid them little mind now however traditional gatekeepers have neither the power nor the cultural capital to stop trump like candidates and in the republican party where the collapse of institutional authority is most severe and most dangerous the aftermath of a trump loss will further weaken the party s center as trump s supporters turn on the elites whose tepid backing they will argue doomed their candidate sean hannity for instance has already called paul ryan a saboteur and breitbart published an article headlined he s with her inside paul ryan s months long campaign to elect hillary clinton president it is hard to see how the republican party s core institutions or top officials emerge strengthened if trump loses narrowly and it is likely that they will be effectively replaced co opted or hollowed out if he wins meanwhile the social conditions that led to trump the rapid browning of america foremost among them will persist and even accelerate already nonwhites make up a majority of children under 3 years old the country is on a fast path to becoming majority minority and many white male voters will continue to perceive this change as a loss in both status and political power which in some ways it is eventually these conditions will run into a recession that brings with it much sharper economic pain this is not to say republicans will always or even routinely nominate candidates as dangerous as trump much had to go wrong for him to be nominated but having been nominated much will have to go right for the country not to elect him and more will have to go right for it to not elect someone like him in the future the lesson of this unnerving year is that less can be taken for granted than we thought the american people are not immune to demagogues and the american political system is too weakened to reliably stop them america like all the world s other countries is vulnerable to catastrophic political failure it can happen here trump will likely lose on tuesday but if he loses it will be because he is a crude undisciplined demagogue the world also produces clever disciplined demagogues and they are the ones who truly threaten republics get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
