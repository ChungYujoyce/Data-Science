the intercept is a first look media company an unnamed victim of domestic violence in washington d c on march 13 2019 photo katherine frey the washington post via getty images to say that we have seen a spike in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic would be an understatement in the weeks since populations worldwide have been directed to stay home to prevent the virus s spread cases of domestic violence have surged and that s reported cases this should come as no surprise women and it is predominantly women who are victimized are confined to isolated homes with abusive partners whose coercive and physically violent tendencies are enabled and further inflamed by economic stressors supportive community ties are severed while emergency services shelter systems and social services are overwhelmed and congenitally underfunded according to statistics released by the united nations reports of domestic violence in france increased 30 percent following the country s lockdown on march 17 during the first two weeks of lockdowns in spain the emergency number for domestic violence received 18 percent more calls and help lines in singapore have received 30 percent more calls as nbc news reported law enforcement agencies across the u s have seen domestic violence cases rise up to 35 percent in recent weeks this shadow pandemic as u n experts are calling it knows no borders keep in mind that before the pandemic hit one in five women who had ever been in a couple reported experiencing sexual or physical violence by an intimate partner in the last year consider too that 50 percent of domestic abuse cases go unreported as with so many devastating consequences of the coronavirus pandemic this moment has revealed and exacerbated underlying preexisting conditions of structural violence the staggering recent statistics should produce a societal reckoning with the presumption that the nuclear household is a place of safety to be preserved only occasionally a site of violence but we can t think of the pre pandemic prevalence of domestic violence as a tolerable normal to aim towards instead there need to be longer term responses offering social and economic infrastructure and services so that women and children are not dependent on the patriarchal household structure for survival safer spaces of cohabitation and community must be recognized and supported far from a time to acquiesce to family values ideology feminist theorist sophie lewis wrote last month the pandemic is an acutely important time to provision evacuate and generally empower survivors of and refugees from the nuclear household this means recognizing governmental responses to the dramatic spike in domestic violence as insufficient stopgaps on sunday u n secretary general ant nio guterres delivered a public statement calling on governments to put women s safety first as they respond to the pandemic his message was accompanied by a set of recommendations including that governments increase investment in online services and civil society organizations declare shelters as essential services and continue to prosecute abusers and hold in prisons individuals convicted of violence against women numerous national and local governments alongside nongovernmental organizations are already acting on such advice canada is keeping domestic violence shelters open and diverting 50 million to support shelters for victims of domestic and gender based violence the u k france and australia have dedicated funding to organizations providing services france is also covering the cost of temporarily housing survivors in empty hotel rooms yet the recommendations from the practical to the carceral are short term responses to a heightened state of emergency it s a grim state of affairs when it s deemed necessary for the safety of survivors to keep convicted abusers behind bars while prisons become petri dishes for covid 19 the need for well funded and robust support services for survivors including psychological care and economic resources cannot be underestimated but interventions cannot begin and end after the point of abuse the conditions of gender based and sexual violence must be disrupted in his sunday statement the u n secretary general said i appeal for peace in homes around the world his comment brought to mind the words of late philosopher bernard williams to say peace when there is no peace wrote williams is to say nothing the long term plague of domestic violence is too deadly and rampant for responses that amount to nothing tackling this scourge will be no easy task it requires no less than critiquing the nuclear household and the traditional family form those lucky enough to live in happy family units and intimate partnerships are not nearly in a great enough majority to consider these sorts of households de facto safe sites which are only occasionally ruined by abusive bad apples patriarchal violence is too common for such an ideology to hold up feminist anti capitalist responses that call for family abolition produce understandable conservative backlash concerns from parts of the left about the idea of family abolition have also been raised at a time when the state is committed to tearing apart migrant families at the border and removing black people from their homes through mass incarceration there s a clear need to protect and defend so many families yet the abolitionist call is not to break up loving and supportive familial bonds but to add to them to recognize that the nuclear family should not be the presumed center of social support or even childcare capitalism has always relied on the nuclear family form for its reproduction but if the pandemic reveals anything it s that we can t rely on the structures that serve capital to also serve the people looking beyond pandemic lockdowns we should fight for policies that socialize or indeed communize child and elder care these policies can provide women the economic and social support to never have to rely on an abusive partner for survival in the first place by making sure the burden of this care work is not confined to the domestic sphere we should insist on the legitimacy of homes and living situations that are built on more than blood ties and coupledom it seems likely that whole communities will again and perhaps again be forced to shelter in place when that happens the struggle for those places of supposed shelter to be free from the threat of gender based and sexual violence will entail changing
