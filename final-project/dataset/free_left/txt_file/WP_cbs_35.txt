watch cbsn live by jake rosen updated on may 15 2020 10 53 am cbs news as governors are tasked with reopening their state s economies safely mayors of large cities across the country face a battle between balancing the health of their citizens and preventing a larger coronavirus outbreak with abiding orders issued by governors to open up the state s economy austin mayor steve adler a democrat and provo mayor michelle kaufusi a republican must overcome significant local obstacles as their states begin to reopen austin mayor steve adler on gop texas governor greg abbott s reopening of barber shops and nail salons if i was governor i wouldn t have opened those things because intuitively they seem to me like they d be a big leak in the system for a potential increase in cases the disconnect in policy to reopen texas between abbott and the austin city government it s confusing when wearing face coverings makes it more likely that the governor s plan to reopen our businesses will be successful but when we re not given enforcement powers it s confusing to people in the public because they think well they re not really serious about it provo mayor michelle kaufusi decision to not announce a stay at home order in provo i believe the citizens of provo i trust them and i feel like they trust me and i believe they have the ability to self regulate the possibility that brigham young university and other colleges in provo do not resume in person classes for the fall semester we re a college town and it will hit us we re going to take a hit on this and it will be an impact i m going to supplement some of the loss that we re getting from not having brigham young university open and the different businesses who are struggling in one capacity or another adler sparred in recent days with the republican governor of texas greg abbott and his administration over his city s regulations including enforcing criminal or civil penalties for not wearing face masks in public and the extension of its stay at home order this week texas attorney general ken paxton wrote a letter to adler attacking the policies as having confused recommendations with requirements and said that the city s decisions impose their own will on private citizens and businesses abbott last week advocated for the release of a dallas salon owner who had been jailed for violating the state s stay at home orders abbott later rewrote his executive order to stop local authorities from enforcing penalties for those in violation of his order on this week s episode of the takeout with chief washington correspondent major garrett adler said that it s confusing when wearing face coverings makes it more likely that the governor s plan to reopen our businesses will be successful but when we re not given enforcement powers it s confusing to people in the public because they think well they re not really serious about it adler s recent order also included an optional provision that austin restaurants keep a running log of their patrons as the city begins to reopen so that contact tracers can track down those who potentially have been exposed to the coronavirus should there be further cases of the virus paxton called the contact tracing suggestion orwellian but adler pushed back i did that because if we are going to be able to contain this virus in a way that enables businesses to reopen one of the things that we need to do is contact tracing adler said it s going to be impossible for our contact tracers to get to everybody someone has been around unless we have help for kaufusi in provo the situation could not be more different unlike most local officials kaufusi has not instated any stay at home orders only recommendations to the residents of the city she said she trusts provo residents to listen to her guidance and look out for one another i believe the citizens of provo i trust them and i feel like they trust me and i believe they have the ability to self regulate kaufusi told garrett kaufusi recently launched a psa campaign of her own family which includes two of her sons who are nfl players to keep provo residents aware of social distancing guidelines she also never ordered retail stores in provo to close but encouraged takeout orders from provo restaurants until two weeks ago when restaurants were allowed to open back up in a limited capacity there are tight restaurant guidelines gloves face masks menus have to be disposable you can only pay with a credit card kaufusi said adding that provo had opened up its recreational centers while abiding by social distancing guidelines both mayors conceded that there is a realistic possibility there will not be in person college classes in the fall at universities in austin and provo but
