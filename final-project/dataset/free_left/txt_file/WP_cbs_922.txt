intelligence community following the 9 11 terrorist attacks nctc is a signature branch of the office of the director of national intelligence it comprises officials detailed from several other agencies including the cia and fbi and is responsible for analyzing integrating and sharing terrorism related intelligence across the government it has in recent years come under scrutiny as the administration s national security focus has shifted away from counterterrorism efforts toward strategic competition with world powers like china and russia but separate from broader organizational

personnel changes at u s intelligence agencies the op ed was published before the nominations of shiao and linkins were announced the officials called the unceremonious removal of travers and his deputy another career official who will now return to the national security agency the latest in a deeply destructive path being pursued by the trump administration to remove apolitical experts to be
