 in what some within the democratic party say could be a watershed moment an excerpt from a new book by former interim democratic national committee chairwoman donna brazile raises new concerns about the organization s influence in the 2016 presidential primaries the excerpt from brazile s new book hacks the inside story of the break ins and breakdowns that put donald trump in the white house was published thursday in politico magazine and potentially shows the depth of coordination between the dnc and hillary clinton s 2016 presidential campaign the book also explores whether the contest between the former secretary of state and sen bernie sanders was weighted against the vermont lawmaker brazile a former abc news political contributor said she was shocked when she heard that the clinton campaign had entered into a joint fundraising agreement with the dnc long before it was clear that clinton would be the party s nominee the funding arrangement with hillary for america and the victory fund agreement was not illegal but it sure looked unethical brazile wrote if the fight had been fair one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead this was not a criminal act but as i saw it it compromised the party s integrity the tell all has drawn swift reactions from democrats like sen elizabeth warren d massachusetts and rep tulsi gabbard d hawaii president donald trump also weighed in two former dnc executives told abc news friday they were unaware of the scope of the financial agreement between the clinton campaign and the organization the victory fund money was supposed to be spent between the campaign and the state parties during the general said jim zogby a former member of the dnc s executive board during the 2016 elections it was a violation of agreement and process democratic reaction reacting to the news thursday on cnn warren said the revelations reveal a real problem with the dnc and that she agrees with the notion that the democratic nomination was rigged for clinton what we ve got to do as democrats now is we ve got to hold this party accountable warren said adding that new dnc chair tom perez has to do more to bring sanders supporters into the nomination process he s being tested now this is a test for tom perez and either he s going to succeed by bringing bernie sanders and bernie sanders representatives into this process and they re going to say it s fair it works we all believe it or he s going to fail warren said in a video released thursday night gabbard an early sanders supporter said the news reveals just how much the dnc and nomination process needs to be reformed this is further evidence of a party and a campaign finance system that needs to be completely overhauled and reformed these reforms must empower the people and take back our party from the special interests of a powerful few gabbard said another former dnc staffer took issue with how brazile characterized the agreement between the dnc and the clinton campaign the jfa joint funding agreement was signed and made public a year before donna became chair bernie was offered one too and chose not to use it we should be thanking brooklyn for funding the dnc when no one else was donna is just wrong about this the former staffer said president trump also weighed in on the issue today attempting to divert attention away from potential links between his campaign and russia during the 2016 election saying that he always felt he should have faced sanders in the general election a broken system among the claims brazile makes about the current state of the democratic party is the charge that president barack obama left it in very poor financial shape obama left the party 24 million in debt 15 million in bank debt and more than 8 million owed to vendors after the 2012 campaign and the party had been paying that off very slowly brazile wrote a spokesman for the former president s office did not respond to abc news request for comment others disagree it is dramatic overstatement to say that president obama bankrupted the party the fundraisers the president did were some of the best that happened for the party said r t rybak a former mayor of minneapolis and a former vice chairman of the party julian zelizer a history and public affairs professor at princeton university says it s not abnormal for a party to have to recover after a two term president but that the current division within the party after 2016 is more severe it is true that usually when a two term president leaves that his party often is in trouble but i think there are many who agree that this is on the worst side of the spectrum and so the party is paying a price for it zelizer said zelizer also said instead of arguing about the 2016 election democrats should focus on a more universally agreed upon target i think the best thing democrats can do is to keep the focus on president trump who all democrats would probably agree is not good for the country a case for reform zogby told abc news he hoped brazile s book would buttress reform efforts if we do not reform we cannot unify and if we cannot unify we cannot win so to me reform is simply a way of bringing the factions of the party together so we can function as a unified whole he told abc news as a member of the unity commission charged with helping reform the party zogby and other members of the panel appointed by sen sanders have been pushing for a stronger and more transparent governance structure specifically they suggest options such as an open and transparent budget that will be proposed and voted on by the executive committee an internal judicial review board budget oversight committee and a ban on conflicts of interest zogby argues a judiciary review board would allow candidates or state officers who have grievances a place to be heard internally if we do not create structures to solve these problems in house then the only time we ever get to deal with problems is when they break in the news a scandal or a problem and then we have to address it he said other members of the unity commission speculate the reason there has been pushback on budget transparency is because too many paid consultants also have holding voting power in the party in addition to the work being done on the unity commission former sanders supporters and new voices need to be represented on the leadership teams reformers say just last month perez removed zogby and others from their posts on the executive committee the move angered a lot of progressives in the party who accused perez of purging people who either did not back him for his chairmanship position or backed sanders during the primary this is our party too said rania batrice who worked for sanders and advised the dnc during the general election the voices at the dnc have to be balanced however others say those pushing reforms are overlooking the progress made there is nothing wrong with the democratic party that cannot be solved with democracy said rybak the former dnc vice chairman he cites the very public and drawn out election the party went through in february to elect perez amid other leadership posts this is the most democracy we have had in party leadership in years he said it is a huge difference brazile is set to appear on abc s this week with george stephanopoulos this sunday to discuss her new book 24 7 coverage of breaking news and live events
