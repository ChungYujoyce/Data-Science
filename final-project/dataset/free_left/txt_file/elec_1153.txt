the popular conservative argument that george w bush kept us safe from terrorism has always been somewhat undermined by the fact that the vast majority of domestic terrorism deaths in american history occurred while bush was in office but it turns out that it took donald trump to offer an argument that democratshave always shied away from telling bloomberg tv when you talk about george bush i mean say what you want the world trade center came down during his time how pathetic for realdonaldtrump to criticize the president for 9 11 we were attacked my brother kept us safe as phrased by trump the argument is provocative to the point of poor taste but in attempting to rebut it jeb bush went and made exactly the explicit claim that the doctrine of bush kept us safe has always avoided that the period of time during which bush kept us safe includes 9 11 itself pre jeb nobody made the argument in that way because it s obviously ridiculous instead kept us safe ism has tended to indulge in the fantasy that bush was inaugurated in mid september 2001 rather than early late january through this metaphysical sleight of hand the events of 9 11 themselves neither refute nor bolster the notion that the bush years were a time of safety with his clumsy effort to parry trump however jeb has given away the whole game after all we clearly were not safe on 9 11 get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
