the following is the full transcript of an interview with republican sen lindsey graham of south carolina portions of which aired sunday june 30 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan senator graham thank you for joining us north korea continues to develop nuclear weapons sen graham thank you margaret brennan they didn t make a serious diplomatic offer when president trump last met with kim jong un should he be meeting with him again senator lindsey graham there s no downside to keep trying they haven t exploded a bomb they haven t tested any icbms in a quite a while so i would encourage the president to keep talking but the point is to get irreversible verifiable denuclearization of the peninsula that s the goal and if trump thinks he can do this by continue to engage kim jong un let s give it a try margaret brennan i want to ask you about china president trump had a meeting with xi jinping at the g20 and he seemed to make a concession by no longer banning american companies from selling goods to chinese tech firm huawei which the u s has said is a national security threat and could be used to spy so is the president taking them off the blacklist something he should be doing sen graham well it s a lot of leverage because huawei is a huge chinese company and it really is owned by the chinese government it s not a private sector company as we would know it microsoft came into my office trying to make sure that they could sell some technology to china that would not compromise our national security so i don t know what he agreed to regarding exceptions to the ban if they re minor exceptions that s okay but if we re selling huawei major technology that would be a mistake so i don t know margaret brennan but you don t worry that this is too much of a concession on national security grounds sen graham i don t know yet it s clearly a concession there s some type equipment we could sell to huawei and other chinese companies that would not hurt our national security but there s a reason that huawei has been on the on the banned list it is a chinese company owned by the chinese government deeply controlled by the military that could be used to hijack technology data and and steal trade secrets and other things so i don t know the nature of the exception there ll be a lot of pushback if this is a major concession if it s a minor concession i think it s part of the overall deal margaret brennan senator we re speaking to you where you are in turkey which is a nato ally we know president trump did meet with president erdogan sen graham right margaret brennan at the g20 as well and he seems to have the impression that president trump said there will not be u s sanctions if turkey goes ahead and buys russian made weapons systems is that the case sen graham well i m in turkey and it s being reported in the turkish media that president erdogan is claiming that president trump in their discussions told turkey that if you activate the s 400 we ll find a way around sanctions i doubt if that conversation occurred it s impossible under our law if turkey buys the activates the s 400 missile battery they bought from the russians sanctions would be required under law and we also a couple of days ago passed legislation banning the sale of the f 35 to turkey if they activate the russian s 400 missile battery there s no way we re going to transfer to turkey the f 35 technology and let them buy a russian missile battery at the same time it would compromise our platform margaret brennan but you re not saying sanctions are inevitable at this point you see a way around them some kind of compromise sen graham i hope so turkey s a strategic ally they ve helped us in syria they re a nato ally but they cannot have an s 400 russian missile battery president trump s right that the last administration probably was too hard they should have sold them the patriot us missile battery to protect turkish airspace the way around this is to get the turkey to back off activating the s 400 replace it with a patriot missile battery that is nato compliant i don t want a conflict with turkey they re a very important ally particularly when it comes to syria and the region but under our law there is no discretion if they activate the s 400 russian missile battery they will be sanctioned under u s law and the f 35 technology cannot be transferred to turkey we need to find a way out of this dilemma margaret brennan i m sure you saw that video of presidents putin and trump seeming to laugh when asked about election meddling did that concern you sen graham yeah what concerns me is are we gonna be ready for their meddling next time i ve seen this administration up their game in 2018 we had a midterm election without a whole lot of interference because we re we re upping our game so to speak so it was clearly a joke but the the key to this is to continue to punish russia so hard based on what they did in 2016 they will not do it again in 2020 and i can say this about the trump administration they ve level leveled more sanctions against russia than anybody and one of the reasons turkey can t buy the s 400 from russia is because the law we passed margaret brennan but last time you were on this program you said russia did not learn its lesson so when you see this joking about something so serious regarding an upcoming election doesn t that counter everything sen graham yeah margaret brennan in terms of a hard line the rest of the national security community is trying to send sen graham i m not so sure rebuking putin in in front of a bunch of cameras does much good what hurts him is when you hit him in the polit pocketbook his oligarch friends are having a hard time placing their money around the world we put tremendous sanctions on the russian economy particularly in the energy area and it s biting russia so actions mean more than anything in this part of the world so i m pleased with what the administration s done regarding russia and we need to send an unequivocal signal that if you try in 2020 what you did in 2016 the worst is yet to come regarding russia margaret brennan do you believe that president trump embracing saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman undermines the us credibility on human rights sen graham yeah i don t think it helps i led the effort to sanction m b s the crown prince there is no doubt in my mind that he ordered the killing of mr khashoggi that he knew about it that he s done things like that to other people and that he s been a disruptive force throughout the region that his behavior is unacceptable and while saudi arabia has been a strategic ally i choose not to turn my back on a ally who chops a man up in a consulate violating every international norm so i m in a completely different place when it comes to mbs the president has a different job than i do but i think a majority that congress republicans and democrats are not going to accept business as usual with saudi arabia as long as mbs is around margaret brennan you ve been warning about iran potentially restarting its nuclear program are you concerned that israel would potentially carry out a strike that would draw the u s into a conflict sen graham the ball the most likely war would be between israel and iran if the iranians started to reprocess and enrich beginning july the 7th in a manner that would accelerate their path to a bomb israel cannot tolerate a nuclear armed iran the world should not tolerate a nuclear armed iran and i hope the president understands that if they begin enrichment on july the 7th that he needs to get ready to send the strongest signal possible that this cannot be tolerated i don t mind the iranians having a nuclear power program i don t mind the arabs having a nuclear power program but none of them should be able to make their own fuel enrich or reprocess uranium there are 50 nations that have nuclear power that do not enrich and reprocess i would put iran and the entire arab world on that list nuclear power yes a pathway to a bomb no and israel cannot risk the consequences of a breakout by the ayatollah margaret brennan right sen graham who has sworn to destroy the state of israel and when he says death to israel i think he means it and i believe people in israel believe he means it margaret brennan but enriching as you say doesn t necessarily mean you re moving towards a bomb do you know what president trump s red line is in terms of what iran does with its nuclear program sen graham the reason the president got out of the jcpoa is that after 10 years there are no limits on the enrichment reprocessing capabilities of the iranians again there are 50 nations throughout the world that have nuclear power that don t make their own fuel the way you make a bomb is you enrich and reprocess going but the difference between nuclear grade fuel and a bomb is a matter of months so what i think the president should do is offer the iranians and the arabs the same deal one two three agreements for the entire region arab and iranian region where you can have nuclear power you get your fuel from the russians and the chinese the iranians can and we ll provide it to the arabs that s the only good outcome i think and i think anything less than that is going to lead to an iranian breakout and that puts israel in a really bad box margaret brennan here at home i know you ve been working with the president s son in law jared kushner and some democrats as well to try to find some compromise around asylum laws the president said that he will go through with rounding up migrants after sen graham yes margaret brennan the july 4th holiday what s happening do you see any legislative compromise sen graham yes i do i spent about an hour with speaker pelosi and here s the compromise we ll start turning the aid back on to central america without investing in central america this problem never stops it is in our national security interest to help the triangle northern triangle nations with their economy with their rule of law problems but if you don t turn off the magnets that attract people which is our asylum laws if you don t reform them they ll keep coming all you have to do is to put one foot on the united states soil if you re from central america with a small child you re not going to get deported they re advertising all over central america pay a coyote pay a smuggler get to america if you bring a small child you re never going to go be sent back we need to change those laws and we also need to invest in central america to me that s the deal margaret brennan but on that question of children it it was that image of that el salvadorean father who drowned along with his 2 year old daughter that really captured sen graham right margaret brennan a lot of attention this week that was his child that was not a tool to exploit the asylum system sen graham yeah margaret brennan by warning that asylum is going to get tougher sen graham can i margaret brennan and saying that the border might close doesn t that incentivize people that take the risk in the first place doesn t that turn people towards trying to come to the united states rather than dissuade them sen graham good question here s what i think and i don t know and it does break your heart to see that image and the thought that went into it here s what i think the father believed if we can just make it across the rio grande and i can put one foot in america my child and myself are gonna be in america and we re not going to get sent back i would like that asylum claim to be made in mexico at a u n center so that this father doesn t have to risk him and his child drowning in the future asylum claims should be made in the home country or in a facility in mexico because the reason he tried to go across the river he was told by people in central america if you can put one foot on american soil you re home free and this is a tragic result of that policy margaret brennan i want to quickly ask you about your friend joe biden how do you think he performed in the democratic debate this week sen graham he s got to up his game but anybody that knows joe biden there s not a racist bone in his body that s not a clich that s reality but the narrative is that maybe it s not his time and that he s not up to the task i think you will esti underestimate joe biden at your own peril i watched the debate the policy options being presented to the country by the leading contenders on the democratic side are their biggest problem pretty liberal pretty extreme but when it comes to joe biden i think the next debate he s got to change the narrative and one thing i ll say about kamala harris and i said this before she s got game she is very talented she s very smart and she ll be a force to be reckoned with margaret brennan senator graham thank you very much for your time watch cbs news anytime anywhere
