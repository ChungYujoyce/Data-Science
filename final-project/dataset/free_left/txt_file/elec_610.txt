the president s team seems to see the senator from vermont s candidacy as a no lose proposition not so long ago donald trump seemed obsessed with just one of the democrats vying to replace him joe biden over the past year as the former vice president became the front runner trump s campaign spent about 270 000 on facebook ads targeting biden more than it spent against other top candidates then biden began to collapse and bernie sanders started to rise trump s social media ads demonizing sleepy joe tailed off yet thus far there s been no appreciable pickup in anti sanders ads it s as if trumpworld might want to go easy on sanders it does team trump views sanders as the weakest candidate left on the democratic side and isn t eager to do anything to impede his rise several of the president s past and present political advisers told me they seem to see sanders as a no lose proposition the president wins whether the senator from vermont captures the nomination or not should sanders prevail trump s strategy will be to spotlight his democratic socialist identity in an attempt to make voters fear he ll take away their freedom trump will try to brand any democratic nominee a socialist team trump just thinks it ll be easier with the guy whose self description includes the word if sanders falters trump will argue that he was unfairly robbed of a nomination he earned trump has long stoked suspicions of an anti sanders conspiracy within the democratic party for what seems to be two purposes leaving sanders s following so disillusioned that they stay home on election day or perhaps persuading them to switch sides and vote republican sanders may not need trump but for the time being trump needs sanders sanders would be every holiday present rolled into one sean spicer the former white house press secretary and an ex senior adviser to a pro trump super pac told me with bernie there s a general agreement that he s a gift mistreating sanders and alienating his supporters could cost trump the election depending on how the democratic nomination fight ends an analysis from the political scientist brian schaffner shows that in 2016 tens of thousands of sanders supporters voted for trump in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania three battleground states that trump narrowly flipped from blue to red had these voters aligned with the democrats instead hillary clinton would have won all three states and ultimately the election to the extent that a democratic primary becomes close and maybe sanders doesn t get the nomination there s a good chance that a reasonable share of his supporters is likely to buy into the thinking that the party had it in for sanders schaffner a tufts university civics professor told me and if that s the case some of those people might find it easy to sit out a general election or cast a protest vote read what bernie sanders s 2020 rivals learned from hillary clinton sanders could also prove a tougher opponent than trump reckons he has grassroots backing plenty of money and a version of the same populist message that propelled trump s 2016 upset victory democratic operatives see a deep cynicism not solicitude in trump s approach trump feels that he can attract the support bernie has that s all tad devine a top adviser to sanders s 2016 campaign told me i don t think he likes bernie every corpuscle of trumpworld appears dedicated to propping up sanders one obvious tip off that trump is trying to promote sanders s candidacy he s relatively sparing in his insults master of the raw and indiscriminate putdown trump will demean just about anyone teenage climate activists gold star families and deceased lawmakers alike but when it comes to sanders who let us not forget has called trump a pathological liar and a danger to the republic the president often sounds like a fanboy if not a bernie bro even his nickname for sanders crazy bernie is mild by trumpian standards the counterpuncher isn t counterpunching much at all not yet anyway people like his message he s got energy trump said about sanders to reporters in the oval office earlier this month since the summer trump s campaign has spent only about 25 000 on facebook ads that mention sanders often lumping him in with other democrats according to an analysis by bully pulpit interactive a democratic communications firm that also examined the trump campaign s facebook ads targeting biden the trump campaign declined to comment on its advertising strategy if anything trump and his allies have been amplifying a message that sanders has been sending for years that the democratic establishment wants him to lose random events have been portrayed by team trump as part of a plot to doom sanders s candidacy the campaign has referenced the iowa caucus debacle which one official said deprived sanders of a victory lap clinton s fresh criticism of sanders and even the decision by the des moines register not to release a poll on the eve of the iowa caucus during the nevada caucus race which ended saturday the state republican party sent a truck to sanders s rallies displaying a message that the system is rigged against him and in at least one state republicans are trying to swing the election to sanders ahead of the south carolina primary this weekend some state republicans have urged party voters to cross over and back sanders with the explicit goal of vanquishing biden the candidate favored to win south carolina s open primary system allows registered voters to take part in either party s contest we will have a clear contrast between capitalism and freedom loving americans against bernie sanders and his democratic socialists so we would welcome that if it turns out that way said stephen brown the former chairman of the greenville county republican party trump isn t sentimental when it comes to blood sports like politics people are useful to him or they re not his advisers told me that he may feel some affinity for sanders because both face antagonism from party establishment figures but the sanders campaign is under no illusion that the president holds any real affection for him we understand that he s insincere jeff weaver a senior adviser to the sanders campaign told me trump s crocodile tears don t impress us during the 2016 race trump privately called sanders a lunatic sam nunberg a former trump aide told me appearing on jimmy kimmel s late night talk show that same year when both trump and sanders were vying for their respective party s nomination trump said i actually think bernie would be easier to beat than clinton derek thompson bernie sanders is george mcgovern polling suggests that he may be right a wall street journal nbc news survey earlier this month showed sanders beating trump by four percentage points in a general election race a poorer showing than biden and former new york city mayor michael bloomberg more worrisome for sanders is how voters tend to look at a candidate espousing socialist ideas in the same poll about 67 percent said they would have at least some reservations about a socialist candidate compared with just 28 percent who said they d be comfortable with one i like the idea of bernie having to explain democratic socialism versus communism and explain it in south florida to people who fled oppression in their countries marty obst a senior political adviser to vice president mike pence told me every presidential candidate wants a sure path to victory in the 2016 race clinton s campaign believed that the weakest candidate was trump seeing him as so flawed clinton would not only beat him but pick up a few red states such as arizona and georgia along the way in a show of force against trumpism she lost both states along with the ultimate prize in trump s orbit some are warning against a similar overconfidence i know there are republicans who want sanders to be the nominee that s living dangerously says john mclaughlin a trump pollster if he wins the 2020 election that s a bad loss it s more important that we focus on strengthening ourselves as someone whose own campaign prospects were sorely underestimated trump should be cautious in dismissing sanders making political predictions in this volatile climate is risky in time trump may not see sanders as the gift he once relished we want to hear what you think
