covid 19 is rampaging through the country s jails and prisons as of last week the marshall project documented more than 9 400 cases of covid 19 in u s jails and prisons with more than 140 deaths a twitter account tracking prison data puts the figure higher more than 18 000 staff and prisoners infected in the 45 states providing data the known infection rate in jails in prisons is about 2 times higher than in the general population and as of this week eight of the 10 largest outbreaks in the country have been at correctional facilities and even these grim numbers are assuredly low as with most other things when it comes to coronavirus testing prisoners are a low priority for example as of this week 29 prisoners in new jersey are confirmed to have died from the virus but the state has tested less than 1 percent of its incarcerated population despite an outbreak at a jail in miami florida has only tested 615 prisoners with 208 positive but that s from an incarcerated population of 95 000 and the state s department of corrections only began posting the data after several facilities were caught trying to hide virus related deaths full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the facilities that are doing more widespread testing the figures are jaw dropping nearly a quarter of prisoners tested at the bledsoe county tenn correctional complex have tested positive overall about 20 percent of prisoners tested in tennessee have tested positive yet of the 16 correctional facilities surveyed by a local tv news station 11 had tested five or fewer prisoners nashville journalist steven hale reported that of the state s incarcerated population of 30 000 just under 4 000 have been tested two months into the outbreak the riverbend maximum security prison in nashville had tested just two people at a rural prison in arkansas 680 of the 1 700 prisoners have tested positive ohio is one of the few states currently mass testing prisoners the results are astonishing at one facility more than 2 200 prisoners and 174 staffers tested positive at another nearly 1 500 prisoners and 93 staff as of this week 4 072 of the 6 375 inmates and staff the state has tested are positive for the coronavirus an infection rate of over 60 percent north carolina has tested less than 2 percent of its prisoners but at the one facility where mass testing has been done nuese correctional institution 460 of the 770 inmates tested positive or nearly 60 percent at lakeland prison in michigan the first and so far only prison in the state to test all of its inmates 785 of the 1 403 prisoners were positive harris county tex has tested 500 of its approximately 3 000 incarcerated people so far 262 have tested positive an infected to tested rate of 52 percent the infection rate at the rikers island jail is five times that of new york city and 30 times that of the united states the prison s first coronavirus death was a man who had been jailed for a technical parole violation new york gov andrew m cuomo d has refused to consider mass commutations to prevent further spread it isn t much better at the federal level in early march after numerous warning from public health officials about the virus in jails and prisons federal prosecutors were arguing in court filings that prisoners were more protected from covid 19 inside a prison than out a few weeks later the federal bureau of prisons put out a statement boasting that only 10 inmates had tested positive but that s because the agency wasn t testing five days later the number grew to 29 prisoners and 30 staff then came the outbreak at the oakdale facility in louisiana prison officials there responded by simply refusing any more testing of symptomatic inmates as of the most recent bop update 1 692 federal prisoners have tested positive as have 349 staff the associated press reported this week that 70 percent of federal prisoners who have been tested have tested positive at the same time the marshall project recently reported that less than one half of one percent of federal prisoners have been tested at the few facilities where mass testing is taking place infection rates are similar to those we re seeing in state prisons at the fci terminal island in los angeles for example half the inmate population has tested positive so far 33 federal prisoners are confirmed to have died from covid 19 the first confirmed death was patrick jones convicted of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute in a school zone he had 21 grams of cocaine in his apartment the school his apartment was near was a junior college he was sentenced to 27 years in prison the most recent confirmed death was andrea circle bear a native american woman who died after giving birth while on a ventilator circle bear was serving 26 months on drug charges a federal judge initially approved her admission into a drug treatment program but that decision was rescinded after federal prosecutors argued that her drug use presented a threat to her unborn child instead she was sent to a prison facility in texas where despite her low level crime pregnancy and at least one preexisting condition she was denied release contracted the virus and died the rapid city journal reports that at her sentencing u s attorney ron parsons told her don t let yourself or your property get mixed up in the world of illegal drugs it ends badly it didn t have to be this way over the past two months defense attorneys and advocates across the country have begged pleaded screamed and worked frantically to free as many people as possible often putting their own health at risk in king county wash an early epicenter of the outbreak public defenders filed motions to release low level offenders the sick and elderly and those nearing the ends of their sentences one attorney told me that while she and her colleagues attended release hearings in person prosecutors voiced their opposition over the phone to avoid exposure in washington d c city officials assured the public that the jail was taking appropriate precautions citing written policies but they didn t actually visit the jail in person to make sure those policies were being followed the city s public defenders did and found the obscene conditions later verified by an independent auditor in louisiana a sitting judge dismissed covid 19 concerns by explaining to colleagues that drug users have bad hygiene and therefore are more of a threat to spread the virus outside the jail than behind bars after pressure from some members of congress on april 3 attorney general william p barr issued a memo outlining terms for some federal prisoners to be released to home confinement but as with the d c jail those policies appear to only exist on paper the aforementioned marshall project report found numerous examples of prisoners being told they would be released only to find the release orders were subsequently rescinded politico reported that the federal bureau of prisons was isolating prisoners before releasing them sometimes in the same units where it was isolating prisoners showing symptoms of infection it s such a mess of mixed signals and bungled operations that one federal judge recently called it kafkaesque this is what happens when a bureaucracy built on punishment is tasked with compassion it s like asking the dishwasher to make coffee that isn t what it s for since the 1980s there have been periodic waves of stories about people mysteriously found hanging in local jails people arrested for low level crimes such as petty theft or drunken driving or mundane traffic offenses inevitably these flurries of stories have come with speculation that the deaths were murders it s hard to imagine why someone would hang himself over a reckless driving charge instead while there have certainly been plenty of incidents of inmate deaths at the hands of jail staff most of these deaths were suicides these suicides themselves don t occur in waves they re pretty consistent but so often a high profile incident gets journalists digging and they discover the others that have been occurring all along once it s clear that the deaths were suicides after all the outrage then dies down until the next cycle begins sometimes a few voices will make the obvious and important point people who are arrested for low level offenses should not be committing suicide and that they are should tell us that there s something wrong with our jails the opinions section is looking for stories of how the coronavirus has affected people of all walks of life write to us but that point never really seems to resonate with the public americans don t want jailers actively killing people but we don t want our jails too cozy either we want them punitive if that occasionally means conditions that might drive otherwise healthy people to suicide or neglect that leads to preventable death from other causes that s tragic but not tragic enough to hold anyone accountable the covid 19 outbreaks are a symptom of the same problem but distilled sped up and presented in starker relief the main difference is that unlike abuse of inmates or jailhouse suicides this time our neglect of the incarcerated comes with a price as jail and prison staff get infected they ll bring the virus home and infect the surrounding community but we seem to be okay with that too in the early days of the outbreak i spoke with a number of public defenders and criminal justice reform advocates who were hoping the mass emptying of the jails would help make the case for bail reform once thousands of low level offenders were released to prevent virus spread and needless deaths the thinking went we d see that keeping people behind bars because they can t afford bail is purely punitive and doing so does nothing to improve public safety but that argument rested on a faulty premise it assumed that when confronted with the urgency of the covid 19 that upon the realization that prisons and jails by their very nature make inmates sitting ducks for a highly communicable and potentially lethal disease judges governors prosecutors and other public officials would have enough regard for the health welfare and humanity of incarcerated people to at least get low level offenders out of harm s way it assumed they would give a damn it was a good faith assumption grounded in the notion that even the most retributive among us would want to prevent needless mass deaths behind bars it was wildly optimistic read more the post s view america s 2 3 million prisoners are sitting ducks for
