the former republican presidential nominee said the only logical explanation for trump s refusal to disclose his returns is that they hold a bombshell scott bixby in new york thu 12 may 2016 08 46bst first published on wed 11 may 2016 23 21bst donald trump s refusal to release his tax returns is disqualifying for a presidential candidate his predecessor as republican nominee mitt romney has said there is only one logical explanation for mr trump s refusal to release his returns there is a bombshell in them romney wrote given mr trump s equanimity with other flaws in his history we can only assume it s a bombshell of unusual size trump said in an interview with the associated press on wednesday that he would not overrule legal advice not to publicly disclose his tax returns before an audit is complete including if the audit is not completed before november s election although not legally required of presidential candidates the release of tax returns has been considered the norm for party nominees since gerald ford released a copy of his tax returns in 1976 trump has previously declared in a presidential debate that he would release his tax information and shrugged off delays as due to the inherent complexity of his personal fortune i have very big tax returns trump told nbc s meet the press on sunday i m sure you ve seen the picture where the returns are literally from the floor to up to here they re extremely complex there are no laws prohibiting tax returns under audit from being released richard nixon released his own taxes under audit in 1973 it is disqualifying for a modern day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters especially one who has not been subject to public scrutiny in either military or public service romney wrote tax returns provide the public with its sole confirmation of the veracity of a candidate s representations regarding charities priorities wealth tax conformance and conflicts of interest he added mr trump says he is being audited so there is nothing that prevents releasing tax returns that are being audited further he could release returns for the years immediately prior to the years under audit romney stated while not a likely circumstance the potential for hidden inappropriate associations with foreign entities criminal organizations or other unsavory groups is simply too great a risk to ignore for someone who is seeking to become commander in chief romney himself was criticized during the 2012 campaign for initially refusing to release his own returns and then upon their release for not releasing any before the year 2010 trump sought to temper the row with a tweet in interview i told ap that my taxes are under routine audit and i would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election
