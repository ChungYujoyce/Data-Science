on wednesday after defeat in indiana john kasich is announcing he issuspending his campaign which raises the question why why now what changed it was not as though he was ever winning losing indiana seemed like a classic kasich move i thought his whole strategy was win ohio and then just sort of amble alongthe campaign trailuntil the convention at which point some kind of miracle will occur that was even what his ads suggested theybordered on the fantastical they were all missing several key steps he appeared to be running a full south park underpants gnome strategy phase one collect underpants phase two phase three profit with a big question mark hanging high in the sky until the convention john kasich is the nominee his pac sads ran because mumble mumble this i thought was the plan somehow out of a clear blue sky everyonewas supposed towakeup and realizewhat wasgoing on and do the right thing this was already a science fiction premise why change now i thought oblivious was the strategy i thought this was the campaign equivalent of a filibuster where you just keep going until everyone around you is exhausted and succumbs was he not doing this on purpose he kept pointing out that he was good enough and smart enough and durn it people liked him especially in counterfactual scenarios the theme of the kasich campaign wasthe sound of one hand hypothetically clapping not to be confused with thejeb campaign the sound of one hand forgetting to clap he was a particular favorite of hypothetical voters in a hypothetical general unfortunately these days hypothetical voters are not enough still i thought that he was supposed to continue along on the road runner principle where if you never look down you never notice that you arerunning basically unsupported and can coast on to victory you don t need supporters as long as people basically don t mind that you are sticking around as donald trump kept pointing out the percentage of states kasich won got smaller and smaller with each new state added to the total what was keeping him in the race the dream of a contested convention look the odds that if trump failed to get 1 237 delegates those who madeit to the floor wouldwind up choosing kasich wereonly marginally better than the odds that trump reached 1 237 delegates and they miraculously picked kasich anyhow some miracle occurs was always an integral part of the kasich strategy why not stay just in case when you are the last thing standing between the gop and trump is not the time to suddenly remember how this is supposed to work receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
