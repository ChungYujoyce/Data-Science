the coronavirus judging by his performance at monday s covid 19 press conference the president is taking the workplace anxiety to heart or his standard behavior toward female journalists and open biases toward asian and asian american reporters just reemerged in the rose garden it began when cbs news white house correspondent weijia jiang who is chinese american asked trump about why he appears to consider individual countries ability to test for the coronavirus to be a global competition even as the american capacity for testing remains inadequate well they re losing their lives everywhere in the world he responded and maybe that s a question you should ask china don t ask me ask china that question okay after a tense pause jiang who reports on the white house not on foreign administrations asked the president sir why are you saying that to me specifically trump then claimed it was an open comment for anybody who would ask a nasty question like that weijia why is this a global competition to you when americans are losing their lives every day trump maybe that s a question you should ask china weija why are you saying that to me specifically trump i m saying it to anybody who would ask a nasty question like that pic twitter com hokjoxash8 while jiang has yet to remark on the incident shortly after it aired on cnn media correspondent brian stelter said that it s racist to look at an asian american correspondent and say ask china it s part of a pattern from the president which includes a 2018 incident in which he mocked a japanese reporter and told him to say hello to shinzo jiang s microphone was turned off as she pressed trump on her original question and he moved on to the next reporter pointing in the direction of cnn white house correspondent kaitlan collins who attempted to ask a pair of questions no that s okay trump said hoping to move on from the reporter whom he attempted to humiliate in late april when he directed the secret service to move her to a seat in the back of the press briefing room as collins made an effort to ask the president her questions trump decided to shut the presser down prematurely rather than answer shortly before the conflict over the seating assignment last month trump told collins as she tried to engage him don t talk to me on monday he showed that the threat was serious while revealing yet again how unserious his presidency remains good new out of new york katie miller the highest profile trump administration member to have contracted coronavirus is doing better a real sign of the times georgia s governor bids for the rnc amid talk that charlotte might not host after all there needs to be something for democrats to panic about and right now this is it in early april jason furman a top economist in the obama administration and now a professor at harvard was speaking via zoom to a large bipartisan group of top officials from both parties the economy had just been shut down unemployment was spiking and some policymakers were predicting an era worse than the great depression the economic carnage seemed likely to doom president donald trump s chances at reelection furman tapped to give the opening presentation looked into his screen of poorly lit boxes of frightened wonks and made a startling claim we are about to see the best economic data we ve seen in the history of this country he said the former cabinet secretaries and federal reserve chairs in the zoom boxes were confused though some of the republicans may have been newly relieved and some of the democrats suddenly concerned everyone looked puzzled and thought i had misspoken furman said in an interview instead of forecasting a prolonged depression level economic catastrophe furman laid out a detailed case for why the months preceding the november election could offer trump the chance to brag truthfully about the most explosive monthly employment numbers and gdp growth ever risk public health or else president donald trump on monday morning threatened to move august s republican national convention out of north carolina unless there are guarantees the state will let everyone attend i love the great state of north carolina so much so that i insisted on having the republican national convention in charlotte at the end of august unfortunately democrat governor roycoopernc is still in shutdown mood unable to guarantee that by august we will be allowed full attendance in the arena he began in a string of four tweets the rncis scheduled to be held in charlotte on aug 24 27 less than a week after democrats are set to wrap up their rescheduled convention in milwaukee it s not clear where the republican convention might be moved or how easily that could be done on relatively short notice and this is only part of why the way too late european travel ban was a complete disaster the europe restrictions followed six weeks later but unleashed chaos in ways that surpassed even that of the muslim ban current and former officials said key agencies including the departments of homeland security and transportation had no meaningful input in the nature of the europe restrictions or how and when they would be executed an administration official said officials from both agencies were present at meetings where the ban was discussed the administration scrambled to round up contractors to conduct temperature checks on tens of thousands of passengers officials said the magnitude of the mobilization was unprecedented even so the contractors were overrun by the rush of travelers that trump had helped unleash even the most basic screening steps seemed to backfire the cdc failed to distribute a new paper questionnaire in time for it to be shared with airlines in advance meaning passengers had to fill it out upon arrival as a result travelers found themselves reaching around one another for slips of paper and pencils risking transmission as the bottlenecks got worse maybe his physical is still being audited it s been more than six months since president donald trumpclaimed to have started his annual physicalat walter reed hospital but the white house is declining to explain why he has yet to complete the yearly doctor s examination senior administration officials did not immediately respond to nbc news request for comment about the delay despite trumpannouncing
