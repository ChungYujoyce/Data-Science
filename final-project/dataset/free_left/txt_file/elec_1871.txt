the big idea just like the midterms oneyear ago itwas another awful night for democrats sign up to receive the daily 202 delivered directly to your e mail inbox the kentucky surprise is the biggest story of the night here are eighttakeaways from bevin s blowout in the bluegrass state 2015 really is the year of the outsider democratic governors association executive director elisabeth pearson chalked up democratic attorney general jack conway s defeat to trump mania in a press release jack conway ran a strong campaign unfortunately he ran into the unexpected headwinds of trump mania losing to an outsider candidate in the year of the outsider focusing on social issues including promises to defund planned parenthood and defend kim davis helped drive the conservative base to turn out i wrote here monday about bevin sfocus on energizing evangelicals in the final days and it clearly paid off kim davis called herself ecstatic about bevin s victory in a statement released by the nonprofit representing her he is such a genuine and caring person i will be forever thankful that he came to visit me while i was in jail at a clerks meeting he hugged me and said he was praying for me i am looking forward to his leadership as our new governor the south is becoming even redder and the realignment that began a half century ago is nearly complete president obama is toxic even in non federal elections mississippi republican gov phil bryant easily won reelection too andthe gop increased its majority in that state shouse from 67 to 73 of 122 members that s nearly a super majority republicans even toppled thehouse minority leader per the clarion ledger pressure will let up a little bit on rand paul to drop out of the presidential race to focus on his 2016 senate reelection campaign the incumbent state auditor adam edelen who national democrats hoped would challenge paul in next year s senate race lost in a stunning upset david weigel and paul kane noteina smart take what this election shows is that people who ve been promoting democrats on the rise in kentucky have been completely wrong paul told the post last night not only has president obama destroyed the party in kentucky he s destroyed the bench the bench that was supposed to rise up and run for office that s gone paul celebrated bevin s win even though bevin hadsaid during the campaign ben carson is his favorite candidate in the presidential race the republican win is another big nail in the coffin for big labor unions in the south bevin s top economic priority is making kentucky a right towork state bevin will be a bull in the china shop but he is unlikely to govern as radically as many of the stories you ll read today suggest i ve spent more than 24 hours with the governor elect going back to january 2014 when i profiled him for politico bevin is certainly an ideologue but i ve seen him show signs of a profound pragmatic streak he told me last week that he ll lead in the tradition of a former kfc ceo a moderate democrat who was not beholden to anyone and cleaned up state government in the 70 s his efforts to make nice with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell who attacked him fiercelylast year show thathe s capable of becoming a serious politician there should be more soul searching among pollsters who once again got it wrong every survey of kentucky showed conway ahead which meaningfully altered perceptions of the race but but but turnout was very low across the country republicans could overinterpret the results at their own peril the presidential election exactly one year way will have dramatically larger and more diverse turnout which works against the gop serious structural problems persist the grand old party is still too white too male and too old hillary clinton s political director amanda renteria tweeteda photo of a vote here sign overnight and wrote wish more people did this today there were also some bright spots for the left on an otherwise dark night in a stinging rebuke of chris christie undercutting one of his rationales for seeking the presidency new jersey voters ousted at least three republicans from the state assembly alexander burns in the new york times republicans had hoped to build on mr christie s political successes and cut into the democratic majority in the chamber where democrats currently hold 48 of the 80 seats instead the election became a sharp reality check for allies of the governor who only two years ago won re election by a towering margin democrats battered republicans for their affiliation with mr christie sending paid political mail accusing them of aiding the governor s presidential ambitions at their constituents expense perhaps mindful of his diminished popularity mr christie appeared at private events to raise money for republican candidates but he never hit the campaign trail as a public spokesman for his party dems now have their biggest majority since the

been quiet for the first year in the senate but now that he s voiced his opinion he does not plan on letting up he gave his maiden floor speech yesterday i m a historian by training sasse explained until a few decades ago he said it was traditional for new senators to wait a year to speak that that s no longer the case he suspects speaks to the pathology of the modern senate where lawmakers deliver stale talking points for the benefit of the c span2 cameras often with nobody else in attendance i ask if he s been biting his tongue all year listening to speeches without giving any of his own oh for heaven s sake he says since he is 99th in seniority he s often tasked with presiding over the floor which in practice means hoping the c span2 cameras don t catch him munching on chocolate
