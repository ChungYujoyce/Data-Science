advertisement supported by his narcissism is a grave danger to our health by jennifer senior opinion columnist the coronavirus is no longer just a slow moving public health crisis that may soon turn into a rapid moving one it s a crisis of transparency it s a crisis of government legitimacy so it is in this spirit that we all have to say enough whose side is the trump administration on based on every public appearance we ve seen so far whether it s from a cabinet member or the director of the centers for disease control or the president himself the answer is clear not the public s president trump hellbent on re election is focused on massaging numbers and silencing bearers of bad news that s what autocrats do and it s endangering lives on saturday the associated press reported that trump overruled his own health officials who wanted to warn older americans and the fragile against flying on commercial airlines our storied c d c now annexed by politicians continues to insist that only the most floridly symptomatic patients be tested for the virus even that remains a challenge last week it refused to test an ailing nurse in northern california who d treated a positive patient prompting the head of national nurses united to read her story aloud at a news conference at a friday news conference at the c d c trump told reporters that tests for the coronavirus were now available to anyone who needed one yet just afterward we heard from governor after governor and doctor after doctor that this is categorically untrue with states in dire need of more tests we have no local testing available dr walter mills president of the california academy of family physicians told the san jose mercury news and of course it was at that same news conference that trump infamously said i like the numbers being where they are in explaining why he was reluctant to let passengers some of whom have tested positive for the virus off the grand princess cruise ship floating off california it has since been given permission to dock in oakland that news conference was to me the most frightening moment of the trump presidency his preening narcissism his compulsive lying his vindictiveness his terror of germs and his terrifying inability to grasp basic science all of it eclipsed his primary responsibilities to us as americans which was to provide urgent care namely in the form of leadership it s preposterous for trump to resist determining how widespread this epidemic is yet right now the united states isn t reporting how many people have been tested the c d c pulled the number from its website late last week an extraordinarily detailed article by the atlantic counting state by state put that number at only 1 895 in south korea the number was more than 140 000 which trump dismissed as sampling it was not it was testing straight and simple because we re testing only the sickest of the sick the american fatality rate from the coronavirus is roughly 4 percent it s a frightening and highly deceptive number even higher than china s most experts predict it s likely to wind up at 0 5 percent which is five times more deadly than the typical flu and it could be as high as 1 percent but trump has made the dangerous calculation that he d prefer to keep the number of cases low than convey the full magnitude of contagion when the coronavirus first appeared in china some commentators reached for the chernobyl comparison today the comparison looks increasingly apt for the united states as well maybe it s hyperbolic it ll be months before we know firm numbers on cases and fatalities but the commonalities are easy to spot we re reckoning with a silent invisible and potentially devastating public health crisis and the government is refusing to tell us the facts or what next steps to take because it s too concerned with optics to own up to its initial mishandling of the situation on friday morning trump crowed i think we re in great shape the difference is that because we live in an age of social networks the public is still getting information online but as with all information online some of it is terrible as well as good reuters just reported that democrats are twice as apt to view the coronavirus as an imminent threat to our country as republicans and the reason seems clear the news outlets that do the president s bidding are playing down the potential scope and severity of the problem meanwhile more clear eyed governors are declaring states of emergency and speaking directly to more mainstream news sources to voice their concerns as are doctors and epidemiologists the gulf between their discourse and the talking points of the federal government can be measured in light years the administration is still talking containment epidemiologists in the main are assuming it can no longer be contained and that we should all be responsibly thinking about next steps so that hospitals don t become overwhelmed many of them are worth following on twitter epidemiologists are the new rock stars everyone needs to step up for now the coronavirus is in mostly blue states where cities are but it s only a matter of time one week after representative matt gaetz of florida mocked concerns about covid 19 by wearing a giant gas mask on the house floor one of his constituents died of it senator ted cruz of texas and representative paul gosar of arizona both republicans have put themselves into quarantine having interacted with an infected person at the annual conservative political action conference there s even discussion of congress going into recess fox news republican elected officials the c d c director robert r redfield they all need to stop with their fulsome tributes to trump during news conferences and seize the microphone to help explain how to stem the disease s spread look at italy the government locked down an entire region of the country this weekend corriere della sera recently reported that the intensive care units in lombardy were on the brink of collapse with medical workers setting up beds in the hallways if we aren t careful that could next be us two days ago the british medical journal the lancet more or less implied that many countries won t be able to have both a healthy public and a healthy economy at this moment they ll have to choose this observation jibes with the conversation i had with nicholas christakis author of blueprint and an epidemiologist at yale last friday his lab is using big data to develop tools that would forecast the course of the epidemic in real time in his estimation 35 000 americans will die from the coronavirus this year which would place an enormous additional burden on hospitals already overtaxed by the flu season and his estimate is at the low end for predictions among the people in his field i m in the deeply ironic position at the moment of strongly discouraging social connection despite the fact that it s the central focus of my book and my life s work he says but it s going to take us working together in this unnatural way one that goes so against our evolutionary past to confront this epidemic what s so frightening so hideous is that our president is least equipped to do just that this crisis has unhelmed and unmasked him he s incapable of leading when it comes to trump truth decency and self possession have been in
