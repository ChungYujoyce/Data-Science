 battleground project in the key battlegrounds gop hopes are riding on the sheer force of trump s personality democrats are counting on a cutting edge field operation by kyle cheney and katie glueck 06 15 2016 05 33 am edt donald trump greets supporters before a speech on june 11 in tampa fla ap photo republicans will rely on the sheer force of donald trump s personality to tap into deep seated voter anger democrats are counting on a superior field organization to serve as hillary clinton s firewall interviews with state party chairs in the 11 critical battleground states that will likely decide the general election reveal the two major parties expect to employ vastly different playbooks for the november campaign each adapted to and shaped by the presence of polarizing and historically unpopular nominees at the top of the ticket advertisement his job is to be mr trump said rob gleason the chairman of the pennsylvania republican party his appeal is very different than a normal politician usually when we have rallies for people we prepare weeks in advance all he has to do is announce three days ahead of time he s going to be somewhere and a huge crowd shows up it always energizes people gleason s sentiments were echoed by gop chairs across the swing states from colorado to virginia to michigan they view trump as a lightning rod for the anger of economically struggling americans particularly the white working class and despite his flaws they can envision him causing a dramatic break from conventional voting patterns that will carry him to victory in november publicly at least they insist they aren t worried about reports of fundraising shortfalls or trump s dismissal of the need for sophisticated data analytics leave the back end operations like field organizing and data targeting to the state parties and republican national committee they say white house by edward isaac dovere quite frankly the people who know how to win elections in the state of florida are the people who have been winning elections in the state of florida said blaise ingoglia chairman of the state gop in 2012 we had people up in massachusetts telling the people in the state of florida how to win elections here we know how to win the elections here in the state of florida it s a lot easier to plug into the stuff we re doing deployed the right way trump s force of nature persona could help flip some long blue states toward the gop others said i think if he invests in michigan and shows up in our state he will do very well said ronna romney mcdaniel chairwoman of the michigan republican party and niece of 2012 gop nominee mitt romney we haven t had a candidate actually run a robust campaign in michigan where they re showing up post convention democratic state party leaders on the other hand tend to express confidence that their state of the art field organizations will carry clinton to victory i think we are way ahead said martha laning chairwoman of the wisconsin democratic party we have over 50 field organizers in the state of wisconsin our entire ticket is part of our coordinated campaign democrats are far more organized than republicans are added ohio democratic party chairman david pepper we have a very good operation we built that will merge into the coordinated campaign over 100 staff on the ground while democratic party leaders described frequent sometimes daily communication with the clinton campaign republican party chairs were more likely to describe weekly or twice monthly calls with the trump camp they expressed optimism that the frequency of communication will increase as the general election got underway i can call him gleason said of trump he ll call me back if i call him he doesn t have a lot of people that he s talking to it s a small staff and i think hillary has 1 000 people he s relying on us gop leaders repeatedly described trump s winning coalition this way disaffected coal workers in regions like southeast ohio or southwest virginia struggling blue collar workers in industrial southwest pennsylvania or suburban michigan combined with veterans the bulk of traditional rank and file republican voters and a share of democratic voters from minority groups who typically don t vote gop they expect animus toward clinton will ultimately outweigh any discomfort with trump and insist that he is likelier to corral wayward democrats than clinton is to peel off disaffected republicans call them whatever you want reagan democrats union democrats there s a lot more opportunity to bring those democrats into the fold than hillary clinton ever has at bringing even moderate republicans into her fold said iowa gop chairman jeff kaufmann congress by seung min kim and burgess everett democrats are likewise convinced that moderate republicans will desert the party en masse repelled by the extremes of trump s rhetoric i think some republicans are also going to vote for hillary trump is just too offensive said patsy keever the north carolina democratic party chairwoman you don t know what he s going to do you can t trust him with the decisions of the country it s not a game one area where party officials on both sides of the aisle were in agreement the two nominees would be competing among an electorate that s more diverse than it s ever been more than half of the nearly 20 chairs interviewed in both parties expected a sharply higher hispanic turnout we need to appeal to nontraditional republican voters the asian community hispanic community african americans indian americans have a huge population in northern virginia and richmond said virginia gop chairman john whitbeck we ve got to win those groups that s the coalition on the gop side that challenge has crystallized over the past week trump s campaign has been hammered in the wake of trump s racial attacks against an indiana born judge of mexican descent fueling democratic confidence that his polarizing rhetoric will send hispanic voters into their tent in droves every time he shows his face he gets us more votes said keever who like all the chairs was interviewed prior to the mass shooting in orlando he galvanizes democrats and just other people who are not democrats who are unaffiliated or republicans even there s just so many people who just cannot stomach his lack of respect that s a harrowing prospect for a republican party whose presidential ticket will be led by a candidate who has shredded a post 2012 gop playbook that called for a more tolerant and inclusive approach toward minority voters but some gop leaders believe their recent outreach efforts could insulate them we have been in the communities a lot earlier and with a very high concentration on hispanic communities minority communities engaging in venezuelan communities cuban communities puerto rican communities haitian communities faith based communities within those communities said ingoglia the florida chairman a lot of the hispanic communities here in the state of florida they themselves their parents or their grandparents have fled regions or countries that have been oppressive he continued what s going to resonate with them is that a hillary clinton presidency is going to turn this nation into something that more closely resembles the country that they fled from colorado gop chairman steve house who predicted his state could hinge in part on 300 000 to 600 000 hispanic voters said the state party has been working aggressively to engage the latino community in the state with an outreach and ground operation underway he also pointed to gop congressman mike coffman s outreach efforts coffman learned spanish and engaged in a relentless effort to court hispanic voters during his competitive 2014 reelection bid and house suggested the effort could be a template for courting those voters in 2016 in a race featuring two candidates with high unfavorability ratings though the responses from party chairs on both sides suggested that they were more comfortable attacking the opposition than making an affirmative case for their own presumptive nominee in some cases they ignored the race altogether or framed the presidential match up as a referendum on local issues by bianca padr ocasio in pennsylvania gleason cited scandals that sank the state s treasurer and attorney general as well as the indictment of rep chaka fattah in virginia whitbeck repeatedly invoked democratic gov terry mcauliffe a clinton ally who is facing a federal investigation regarding 2013 campaign contributions hillary clinton is not popular in michigan we had a governor like that in jennifer granholm said romney mcdaniel referencing the state s last democratic governor who left office in 2011 she credited the state s current governor rick snyder for engineering an economic turnaround michigan is on the comeback but our memories are long and we remember what it was like to suffer through bad economic times in our state there is a recognition that that could happen again michigan democratic party chairman brandon dillon scoffed at the analysis whatever ronna s putting in her lemonade i d like some of it he said the reason michigan s economy has turned around is because president obama s administration saved the auto industry this election is not going to be a referendum on jennifer granholm it s going to be a referendum on rick snyder missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020
