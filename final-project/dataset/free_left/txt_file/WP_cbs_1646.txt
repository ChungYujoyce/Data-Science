the following is a transcript of the interview with white house national economic council director larry kudlow that aired sunday august 25 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan good morning and welcome to face the nation today we are focusing on the economy its impact on policy and politics throughout our show you will hear from voters about what it means for them and we begin this morning with white house national economic council director larry kudlow he joins us from saint jean de luz france good morning larry larry kudlow morning margaret thank you margaret brennan the president was asked this morning if he regretted escalating the trade war with china then the white house released a statement saying he meant to say he only regretted not raising tariffs further which is it are you escalating or de escalating kudlow now look actually it s neither but he didn t quite hear the question this morning but his thought was if he had any second thoughts and he said sometimes he does he would have actually raised the tariff not lower it but there is no change a 5 additional tariff on 250 billion and then 5 additional tariff on the second tranche of 300 billion which as you recall goes into place september 1st and then december 15th because there are a lot of consumer exclusions he is responding to the chinese action and i want to say in my judgment at least both actions were very temperate very restrained alright both countries weigh in president trump has got to defend the american economy which he has done and of course as you know our battle to stop unfair trading practices from china more on that if you wish but he s continued the drumbeat but i want to make one last point if i may the negotiations between the two great countries continue we had deputies teleconference meeting last week another one is coming up this week and the principals still expect the chinese team to come to the united states in september so both countries seem to be protecting their turf here but the talks and negotiations continue and i think that s very positive margaret brennan do you expect china to retaliate to the tariffs the president put in place on friday kudlow i do not i i think you know his was an action to respond to their action so i doubt whether they re going to take another step margaret brennan okay kudlow i have not heard their official response yet we ll have to wait and see on that margaret brennan larry in the past you ve been very clear that you think tariffs are essentially a a tax on the american consumer and that it particularly hits low income families how do you tell americans that this is not going to spiral in a way that hurts them kudlow well look one point point i want to make is the economic burden of these tariffs is falling most heavily on china probably by a factor of four or five to one kudlow as far as any impact here i will argue as i have it s a very small minimal impact the burden of this thing is falling way on china and let me just add to your other question the impact for ordinary american families look consumer wages are booming consumer spending is booming actually the best performing sectors in terms of wage increase margaret blue collar workers middle income and lower income workers the bottom 10 percentile is doing the best and our tax cuts have actually provided at least i don t know twenty five hundred three thousand dollars less taxes lower tax liabilities margaret brennan right kudlow on ordinary average american families so the net net is the tax cuts in my judgment far outweigh very small harm regarding the tariffs and look the president again he has got to defend the american economy margaret brennan sure but but larry that success you just kudlow chinese trading practices and ip theft has done great damage to certain sectors of our economy margaret brennan which is why kudlow and the president margaret brennan which is kudlow is determined to defend it and change it margaret brennan which is why so many people support the idea of getting tough with china but they re worried that you re actually going to damage american businesses i m looking at statements from the retail industry leaders association just on friday mr president we implore you to end this trade war before the damage is irreversible national retail federation it s impossible for businesses to plan for the future how and where does this end larry this is the business community saying this china hasn t agreed to any concessions where does this end kudlow well look we we re in constant touch with all those business groups and by the way they re also saying before something really bad happens which i think is an implication nothing bad has really happened i i just want to disabuse so much of this recession talk out there it just ain t so margaret brennan right but businesses kudlow consumers margaret brennan you know have to plan kudlow employment margaret brennan for the future kudlow business itself is doing very well margaret brennan and confidence is a fragile thing you know that so businesses are saying kudlow well that s margaret brennan they re inhibited here kudlow that s fair enough but but at the same time truly thousands and thousands of businesses have implored the president to protect them against china s unfair trading practices and their ip theft and their force technologies of transfers and their high tariffs they have implored the president to take action look he s the he s the first president in our memory margaret to go after these chinese practices which have done so much damage to the american economy and the rest of the world s economy as well he has to do it he is going to continue to do it lower trade barriers would do great great help to our economy to everybody large and small companies we have our tax cut plan which gave the retailers and so forth great benefits gave individuals and small businesses great benefits and we are looking as i said earlier last week there s a tax cut 2 0 study going under my under my aegis we re looking at something it s not immediate we re not worried about a recession margaret brennan well so far but as as you heard the president said he was pulling back some because he was concerned it could be passed along to the consumer do you though based on what the president said again today do you believe that the president does have the authority to block private businesses from investing in china kudlow well look ultimately he does have authority it s margaret brennan how would that work kudlow an emergency economic power authority so in theory that law exists but that s not what the president said he s asking american companies to take a look take a fresh look at frankly moving out of china go in someplace else margaret brennan that takes years kudlow preferably coming home to america it will take years that is correct and that s why there s no immediate action here he just put that out there look i ve heard him say this time and time again the couple of years i ve been working here he said it to individual businesses he said it to the big business groups he s asking them to come home come back home to america we re giving you low taxes and low regulations and an entrepreneurial environment so in a sense this is nothing new maybe the way it was phrased was a little tougher than usual but we come home come home to america this is the bass play the best place to work and live and earn and invest margaret brennan okay so to be clear the president does not believe he can block private transactions with china kudlow he is not intending to right now that is not his intention margaret brennan but that is still something he s thinking about kudlow you know i i don t even want to go down that road it s like first things first let s look straight ahead straight ahead i m going to argue as i have the consumer is booming jobs are booming wages are booming even savings is booming at the same time this economy is strong margaret brennan alright larry kudlow always good to talk to you kudlow thank you margaret appreciate it watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24
