advertisement supported by your money allstate and american family insurance are pushing savings to customers automatically many others have not we asked by ron lieber the best kind of financial help is the kind that you don t have to ask for on monday allstate and american family insurance said they would give their personal auto insurance customers a break since most of them aren t driving as much as they did a month or two ago the savings don t amount to a lot allstate will give most customers 15 percent of their monthly premium back in april and may via a credit to their bank account credit card or allstate account american family will send auto insurance customers 50 for each vehicle on their policies but the nature of the action is exemplary and rare given the context of a pandemic people are sick and many more are struggling nobody wants to have to think to call their auto insurer let alone wait out the call center deluge afflicting most financial services companies auto insurance companies are in an advantageous position in the quest to eke out a public relations win in these grim times if people drive less they crash less fewer crashes mean fewer claims and fewer claims means more premium money sitting around on an insurer s books regulators in all the states where allstate and american family do business generally have to approve their plans to return customers cash but they expect to start sending their refunds soon we know there s been a significant reduction in miles driven and claims filed for personal vehicles since the pandemic began limiting people s activity american family wrote in an f a q on the repayments we are not seeing similar claim trends in our other lines of insurance such as homeowners where filed claims are increasing likely from people staying home more resulting in more accidents be careful with those fireplaces please allstate and american family s relative largess does raise a question though just how good have the stay at home orders been for auto insurers bottom lines allstate s chief executive thomas j wilson said the company was acting on relatively little information right now but what it has gathered was eye opening after one week s worth of data came in we knew this was significant he told me and it was less than two weeks from when we first saw the data to when we made this announcement mr wilson said that driving to work was usually about one third of people s total miles on the road but there are many unknowns insurers are still facing as a result of the stay in place orders he said the people who are still driving are driving faster based on allstate s data will they crash more and do more damage when they do have a wreck how long will the pandemic last when it ends will everyone still want to and get to work from home twice a week mr wilson said he would not know how profitable allstate s auto insurance operation would be without answering all those questions and more american family threw up its hands in similar confusion we re returning to our customers estimated savings based on our best determination of what we know now a company spokesman ken muth said in an email we ll continue to focus on aligning what we charge in premium to the expected costs associated with providing the insurance coverage which is primarily paying out claims doug heller an insurance expert with the consumer of federation of america saw all of this coming a few weeks ago the organization published a letter asking insurance companies to adjust their premiums in anticipation of a likely fall in claims and his colleague micah hauptman has urged customers to call their insurers and ask for a better deal mr heller said in an interview that he was surprised at the two insurance companies decisions since there hadn t been much pressure on them he said that probably would have changed though because state insurance regulators usually keep an eye out for excessive rates they re collecting all this premium and aren t seeing accidents or claims so they have a choice mr heller said they either start giving back money or have to explain their coronavirus windfall at some point on monday i made like a regulator and went to nine other auto insurance companies and asked them whether they intended to match allstate and american family so far nobody is but a couple sound close a progressive spokesman said that the company was exploring how to best return some premium to customers and that it expected to have those plans in place soon and state farm said its officials were closely monitoring our automobile insurance loss trends and are considering how best to take this into account and return value to our auto insurance policyholders we expect a decision in this regard by the end of the week usaa said we are exploring options to continue serving our members well during this difficult time we ll share more in the coming days others were vague a liberty mutual spokesman said the company was continually evaluating ways that we can support our customers and from nationwide we continue to evaluate all of our options travelers said we are working with our customers and their agents to address their changing circumstances and continue to consider a number of programs to support them further in this rapidly evolving situation others did not immediately answer my questions on monday farmers geico and chubb if you re a customer of any of those companies let me know what they say if you call and ask for a break every one of them should be looking at the same numbers allstate s chief executive is and having the same reaction advertisement
