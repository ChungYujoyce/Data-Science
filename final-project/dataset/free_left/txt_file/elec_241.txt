advertisement supported by man in the news by michael barbaro and monica davey long after government regulators had confirmed the lethal consequences of cigarette smoking mike pence mocked their warnings as hysteria in 1998 time for a quick reality check he wrote smoking doesn t kill long after most members of congress had abandoned the quaint practice of delivering one minute morning speeches mr pence eagerly held court in an empty chamber musing about sports and scripture and long after republicans war on big government was fading mr pence defiantly opposed his own party over the creation of signature programs like no child left behind and a medicare prescription drug benefit throughout his career as a congressman radio host and governor gov michael richard pence of indiana donald j trump s running mate has been deeply and proudly out of sync with his times with his formal bearing shiny helmet of white hair and carefully chosen slowly delivered words he is a throwback in his demeanor with his deep social conservatism public religiosity and aversion to negative campaigning he is a throwback in his political style mr trump and mr pence appeared for the first time in public together since mr pence was named as mr trump s running mate here s how we analyzed it he is so abstemious that he once declared that to avoid temptation he would never appear anywhere alcohol was served unless his wife was with him this has earned mr pence 57 both the admiration of republican voters who identify with his homespun manner and the frustration of outsiders who see him as a dangerous anachronism leslie lenkowsky a former professor at indiana university who has known mr pence for 20 years said that in an age of business minded governors who deliberately avoid touchy social issues mike sees himself as a champion of a very culturally conservative set of values that represent small town middle america he sees his role mr lenkowsky said as protecting them in interviews mr pence describes himself as a christian a conservative and a republican in that order those animating forces were at the center of the most consequential and controversial decision mr pence made as governor signing a 2015 law that could have made it easier for religious conservatives to refuse service to gay couples just as same sex marriage was spreading across the country transcript na the national firestorm generated by the law was so fierce that sports leagues trade groups and technology companies threatened to boycott mr pence s state forcing him to revise the law in a compromise that infuriated both sides of the debate for many americans it was a searing introduction to mr pence but for those who have closely tracked his career it fit a longstanding pattern the winds of change might blow but mr pence is slow to bend by the time he was elected to congress in 2000 after two failed tries mr pence had missed the republican revolution led by newt gingrich and his scrappy fiscally conservative acolytes who stormed washington in 1994 nobody it seemed had told mr pence that the rebellion was over he arrived in the house determined to slash federal spending and shrink the role of government it was not to be house republicans led by president george w bush created giant new programs like medicare part d and spent trillions bailing out wall street after the financial crisis i was like the frozen man mr pence said of his poor timing in a 2004 speech frozen before the revolution thawed after it was over a minuteman who showed up 10 years too late he left little mark on the institution during his 12 year congressional career he introduced 90 bills and resolutions none became law showing up late by many accounts was his fate as governor too by the time he was elected his popular predecessor gov mitch daniels along with a republican legislature had checked off almost every box on the conservative wish list shrunken budgets privately managed health care for state workers and a voucher program that allowed public students to attend private schools mitch daniels dominated indiana politics for the better part of 10 years said michael d mcdaniel who was the indiana republican chairman from 1995 until 2002 mike pence would be the first person to tell you that he knew that was going to be a tough act to follow so far he has struggled to carve out a national reputation beyond his polarizing pursuit of socially conservative causes in an echo of his actions on gay rights he signed a strict new law in march that bans abortions based solely on the fetus having a disability such as down syndrome the measure inflamed many women and abortion rights activists across the country and now faces a court challenge a society mr pence said at the time can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable the aged the infirm the disabled and the unborn governor mike pence of indiana who donald j trump announced as his running mate on friday strong strong has a relatively low approval rating among governors his conservatism friends said is firmly rooted in his indiana childhood a postcard from a tranquil midwest of the 1960s the son of a gas station manager he was a quiet altar boy whose favorite childhood memory was playing in a neighborhood creek in college he gravitated from his family s catholicism to evangelical christianity after a fraternity brother at hanover college challenged me to take seriously the claims of christ mr pence later recalled on the house floor his small town plain spoken personality was the centerpiece of his early campaigns in 1988 during his first run for congress he rode a single speed bicycle across 261 miles of his district to meet voters he lost but his feel for the local mood and mores allowed him to master a form of communication that proved pivotal to his political rise talk radio after he lost the 1988 campaign and another in 1990 the mike pence show became his tether to voters across indiana and a springboard into the world of national conservatives the show s origins reveal much about its host the head of a local station had sold mr pence and his mother who attended the meeting on the idea by reminding him that radio was ronald reagan s ticket to stardom in the 1930s our idea was just to keep his name out there said sharon disinger who is a co owner of the station with her husband the broadcast an amiable three hour discussion of politics weather and local life that ran from 1993 to 1999 was a hit it eventually aired on 18 local stations it was pleasant radio like a fireside type chat ms disinger said mr pence described it this way rush limbaugh on decaf and it paved the way for his eventual victory in a 2000 race for congress by then mr pence had made a declaration that could complicate his new political partnership with mr trump whose style leaves no rival unscathed he swore off personal attacks on campaign opponents saying he regretted his tactics against his two time democratic rival representative phil sharp in one 1990 campaign commercial mr pence hired an actor to play an arab dressed in stereotypical garb who theatrically thanked mr sharp for american dependency on foreign oil negative campaigning i now know is wrong mr pence wrote in a contrite essay after he lost to mr sharp in it he quoted from the bible about jesus and sin a campaign mr pence posited ought to demonstrate the basic human decency of the candidate mr sharp in an interview seemed unmoved to me neither he nor trump are of presidential timber mr sharp said but friends said it was a sincere conversion curt smith the president of the indiana family institute a conservative group said mr pence still talked about his regret over that poisonous campaign years later mike talks about his mistakes mr smith said he is coming from a place of conviction admission of error did not come as easily in the case of the religious exceptions law that mr pence signed in 2015 after offending gays across the country enduring a backlash from the state s business community and undergoing a painfully awkward nationally televised interview in which he struggled to explain the law s on the ground impact mr pence acknowledged only that he could have better handled the tv encounter soon after he accepted a revision to the law that he said would prevent businesses from denying services to gay couples or anyone else it was badly mishandled said mr lenkowsky the former indiana university professor on that even mr pence s conservative allies agree the compromise mr pence struck said mr smith turned out to be a dramatic unraveling and i was very disappointed mr pence however seems unperturbed by the politically costly decision and the resulting cultural clash that has come to define his time in office i don t think it s something he regrets said mr lenkowsky if that s his identity that s his identity he can live
