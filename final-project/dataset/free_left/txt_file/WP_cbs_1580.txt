even if they haven t been infected with the coronavirus hundreds of millions of americans have had their lives upended by the pandemic john dickerson reports on the toll the virus taken on our mental health hundreds of millions of americans are at home most of them don t want to be simple choices about what to touch where to walk and what to wear are fraught more than 100 000 people have died worldwide and fears of how much more those numbers could grow have stopped much of daily life but the bills have not stopped coming though the paychecks in some cases have we don t know when it will end it s a recipe for anxiety stress and grief which puts more of us than ever before in a struggle to stay well the regimen of physical hygiene is well established wash your hands stay six feet away cover your face but the rules for good mental hygiene are not as clear psychologists told us that after americans get past the worst of it the worst of it may not be over there may be mental health aftershocks it s hard to predict and living with that unpredictability is part of the challenge john dickerson what does it feel like when that phone rings francesca santacroce we run and we pick it up right away and we re just waiting just we don t know what to expect we don t know if they re going to tell us good news or bad news we re just really anxious about it francesca santacroce is describing the daily update from the hospital treating her father joseph a covid 19 patient on a ventilator before the coronavirus hit her home in the close residential neighborhood of staten island new york her father took care of the family while francesca worked in a doctor s office saving money for medical school a 23 year old biomolecular sciences major she is the first in her family to graduate college but when we first interviewed her at the approved distance in her driveway two weeks ago francesca was shouldering her father s duties cooking cleaning and caring for her 16 year old sister and mother who needs five days a week of home dialysis this video was shot by francesca s sister on a cellphone after their mother was also diagnosed with covid 19 francesca santacroce i literally feel like i m about to shatter in a million pieces right now i feel like one wrong move and i m going to break and i m going to fall apart but i know that i can t i can t do that because i need to take care of my family right now john dickerson you ve been doing this now for a week francesca santacroce yeah john dickerson how long do you think it s going to last francesca santacroce we don t know the doctors don t we don t know and i don t care how long it takes as long as he comes home uncertainty anguish and hope in the age of coronavirus it s not just francesca who is straining the pandemic that has rocked her family has touched nearly every american life daniel kaplin in the last few weeks i think covid has dominated all my sessions daniel kaplin is president of the new york state psychological association and francesca s therapist he spoke to us with her permission john dickerson everybody s racing to get back to their previous lives but once that moment comes what psychological effects of this do you think will linger daniel kaplin i don t think the world s going to be the same i think the loss of jobs even after the virus is gone people are still going to struggle they re going to struggle with how am i going to pay my rent my mortgage how am i going to feed my family so it s going to be an ongoing stressor for many people in this country john dickerson and there s also a psychological benefit to doing productive work daniel kaplin sure right what do you do when a person had their identity taken away from them because they no longer can work john dickerson their identity taken away from them and then they can t move about to replace that identity with any other useful purposeful activity daniel kaplin absolutely yeah john dickerson it s a double whammy daniel kaplin yeah it is days blend together when so much of what used to distinguish them has been paused bridge club is on hold graduation ceremonies are cancelled this week s religious services have been virtual those who live alone are vulnerable particularly the elderly but kaplin says we must all fight against the blurring of the days by establishing a routine john dickerson what happens if you don t have routine daniel kaplin when you don t have that structure that routine can for some people reduce their motivation to do the activities that they still need to do but from home and long term they can become overwhelmed oh i m not accomplishing my goals and then they could spiral into a depression many of us look for connection in social media and the news but too much of that can be harmful a preliminary study done in china after the outbreak found that high social media exposure nearly doubled one s chances of depression and anxiety dr yuval neria we know already from previous disasters that ongoing anxiety during trauma is a huge risk factor for ptsd and depression in the long term yuval neria is the director of trauma and post traumatic stress disorder at the new york state psychiatric institute he s a former israeli tank commander whose own traumatic experiences in the 1973 yom kippur war informed his career studying the brains of veterans with ptsd dr yuval neria the brain is really obsessed about identification of fear you know of what is safe and what is dangerous john dickerson and what i wonder about though there is the part of the brain that is always alive to fear part of the brain that says it s okay don t be fearful you ve been through this before but we ve never been through this before so dr yuval neria oh that s so true what you just said because most of us don t have a comparable memory or set of memories that can serve our understanding of what s going on right now neria led research and training efforts in new york in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks which has led him to be particularly concerned about the health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic dr yuval neria i mean we saw that after 9 11 we saw how many first responders really left out without sufficient medical care and psychiatric care john dickerson in new york city at 7 o clock people open their windows they applaud but then what happens when the clapping stops dr yuval neria right neria estimates that after 9 11 1 to 5 of new yorkers suffered from ptsd four years after the attack he worries there will not be a plan or enough money this time to treat a similar share of a vastly greater population dr yuval neria there is kind of almost like a honeymoon phase right now there is consensus high adrenaline adrenaline and let s do it together i think once this is ended and we face the reality of the aftermath coupled with financial difficulties and shortage of services all of those things can rapidly elevate the risk for a second pandemic which will be a mental health pandemic the cascading challenges were already falling on francesca santacroce who was managing them through therapy but the day after we first talked to her the hospital called her father joseph santacroce passed away he was 50 years old john dickerson francesca i m very very sorry about your father francesa told us she had been unable to see or speak to her father in the hospital but after he died she was given permission to enter the intensive care unit francesca santacroce and they walked me through the icu to see him and just to see all those people on ventilators it was really sad as i walked in the nursing staff all the physicians everyone who was on his case they were they were crying too they were so upset and he looked like he was sleeping honestly and i said to him i m here i m going to take care of everyone you know and everyone s in good hands you know i got this and i told him i loved him and that he can you know that he can go to heaven and i ll take care of everyone down here francesca s first task was taking care of her father s belongings and his car which he had driven to the hospital john dickerson and what was going through your head francesca as you were driving home francesca santacroce i apologized to him john dickerson apologized why francesca santacroce i was so sad that he had to you know go through that alone he had to spend his last last week in quarantine you know he didn t get to talk to us or see us i wish that i was able to hug him one last time and tell him i loved him one last time and you know have him play a joke on me one last time if i would ve known that this was coming i would ve used that time more wisely daniel kaplin one of the areas of guilt and regret is not being able to say good bye john dickerson what do you think are the challenges that francesca now faces daniel kaplin she s in her early 20s she is not financially secure mom is medically fragile just the anxiety around how do you float the household and then long term how does she take care of the family while truly pursuing her dreams the day francesca learned of her father s death jazz great wynton marsalis father checked into a hospital wynton marsalis he was in new orleans john dickerson and you were in new york wynton marsalis i was in new york i was kind of torn between if i go down there he doesn t have it and i bring it to him it s going to be worse four days later ellis marsalis a respected jazz musician and teacher passed away from complications of covid 19 he was 85 years old wynton marsalis he just didn t complain he had a world view he said man i don t determine my time he said the fact that you lose a loved one is no more significant than all the other people who are losing loved ones and that was always his philosophy john dickerson we re all part of the same human family wynton marsalis he felt that he believed it he played it he taught it and you know and he accepted death in that way also while marsalis grieves he is also responsible for jazz at lincoln center where he is managing and artistic director the nonprofit has had to close its performance space and has lost millions of dollars and marsalis says things are even harder for freelance musicians wynton marsalis my father was a freelance musician if this had happened when we were growing up we would literally just have to go from house to house on our street and just to eat this is a very serious time for the survival of a lot of our musicians a man used to juggling projects he once contributed to this broadcast marsalis has been touching base with musicians around the world and trying to raise money for jazz at lincoln center and also for struggling artists all of this returns him to the lessons of his father john dickerson so if he taught you about philosophy as much as about music what would his advice be for this moment we are in where we re sitting in an empty theater we don t know when this is going to end people are suffering wynton marsalis you know he would say you know where you at man what are you gonna do he said you talkin about doin you doin do sumpin let s go john dickerson so how does that work when you re talking to all the people who are involved at jazz at lincoln center and you re wynton marsalis i say almost the same mantra you know we we re in a bad position and we re not going to get out of this overnight but everybody is in our position so let s embrace this space let s work on the trust that we ve built up all of these years let s go out and make stuff happen that we want to see happen we have to move very fast but we have to be even more process oriented and more deliberate and that s how you master a moment of chaos and that is also the strength of jazz john dickerson i was just going to say jazz all of that practice and then in the moment you have to be ready wynton marsalis that s right you marshal all your forces john dickerson and be ready to improvise wynton marsalis and be ready to meet the demands of that moment another thing that we say to each other is let s see if we are who we said we were before we had to deal with this when john dickerson and what does that mean wynton marsalis when everything is normal it s easy for us to be full full of arrogance and commentary now we have to be for real our morality our concept our integrity all these things are coming to bear in this moment john dickerson because it s a test wynton marsalis yeah let s see man wynton marsalis we have a tendency to hear all the negative everybody s dying this and that skull and crossbones there s also this reaffirmation of what makes us great not just as people in a country as human beings recognizing the good amidst the sorrow is at the heart of the second line funeral celebrations of marsalis native louisiana when his mother died three years ago the jazz community took up their instruments for ellis marsalis that celebration will be delayed john dickerson since we re here in this beautiful space would you like to play anything for your father wynton marsalis oh yeah definitely john dickerson yeah wynton marsalis i ll play something for him i wanna wanna lay down my burden down by the riverside produced by andy court associate producer evie salomon broadcast associate claire fahy edited by april wilson john dickerson is
