advertisement supported by by jonathan mahler on paper donald j trump is the last candidate one would expect to raise eyebrows within the jewish community he is from the city with the country s largest jewish population and he made his fortune working among the jewish machers in new york s real estate industry his palm beach club mar a lago was effectively marketed as a jewish alternative to the town s private clubs that had historically excluded jews his daughter ivanka married an orthodox jew and converted he endorsed benjamin netanyahu for prime minister of israel terrific guy terrific leader and yet when he takes the stage on monday at the annual policy conference of the american israel public affairs committee the influential lobbying group known as aipac he will be facing a wary crowd mr trump s ostentatious disregard for the sensitivities of various religious and ethnic groups has hit a nerve among jewish organizations inspiring a barrage of denunciations from across the ideological spectrum they cringed at his trafficking in jewish stereotypes and recoiled when he hesitated before denouncing david duke the ku klux klan figure many jews have said mr trump s comments about muslims reminded them of when they had been singled out and a group of rabbis said last week that it would walk out of his aipac speech in protest what we ve learned from our history is that we can t stand idly by when a leader says those things said rabbi jesse m olitzky of south orange n j one of those who plan to eject themselves mr trump also stumbled when he waded into one of america s most charged foreign policy issues promising to remain a neutral broker between israelis and palestinians for the many jews who side with israel in its dealings with palestinians a number of whom are aipac members that was like fingernails across the chalkboard said ari fleischer the former spokesman for president george w bush mr trump later modified his position to be more pro israel but his wavering left many unconvinced so while mr trump has proved to be a master salesman at rallies and debates the crowd he is addressing on monday a leery group looking for meaningful specifics may be his toughest sell yet he s said a variety of things over the years much of it favorable to israel much of it ambiguous more recently said josh block a former aipac spokesman who now runs a pro israel nonprofit in washington the speech is an important opportunity for this audience to hear what he really thinks on these issues that matter a great deal as has often been the case with mr trump s campaign it is unclear how much the revulsion over his comments and behavior matters in the voting booth little data exist on jewish attitudes toward mr trump and because most american jews are democrats they will not have a chance to weigh in on him unless he becomes the republican nominee bruce balsam 59 who was walking into sabbath services on friday at temple emanu el the stately synagogue a few blocks north of trump tower on fifth avenue said mr trump s shifting position on the israeli palestinian conflict really disturbs me but he added i d want to hear more about that he said he considered mr trump s take on national security and muslim immigration to be more anti islamic than presidential but agreed that caution needed to be taken people who are coming from certain parts of the world where anti american sentiments are high we should be highly cautious of mr balsam said mr balsam pointed to temple emanu el one of the largest jewish institutions in the world as an example you have armed guards outside he said gesturing toward the new york police department s counterterrorism officers who are frequently stationed at the synagogue you have armed guards inside hope hicks a spokeswoman for the trump campaign said mr trump looks forward to speaking to a group whom he has tremendous respect for mr trump has said as president there will be no one stronger on israeli american relations than him and his consistent support and advocacy for israel over many years is proof of this she said additionally mr trump is the only candidate to speak with clarity about the deadly threat of radical islam isis and other islamic terror groups cannot be defeated if we are politically correct that mr trump has found himself in the position of having to defend his pro israel credentials is something of a surprise given his history he has been honored by a variety of jewish groups over the years and as he likes to point out once served as grand marshal of the salute to israel parade in manhattan he has also flirted with licensing a trump tower in israel mr trump has joked in the past that people assume he is jewish because he owns so many buildings in new york he has even claimed to be the victim of anti semitism in the 1990s he accused the palm beach fla government of blocking his efforts to open mar a lago because the club was going to be open to jews he went so far as to send the town council copies of the 1947 film gentleman s agreement about a journalist who poses as a jew in order to expose anti semitism when the anti defamation league objected to mr trump s characterization of his treatment he summoned its national director abraham foxman to breakfast at the plaza hotel to complain mr trump did not apologize though he did agree to stop claiming anti semitism and instead use the more general term of discrimination mr foxman recalled now mr trump is the one who has come under attack after rolling out a familiar anti semitic trope in a speech to the republican jewish coalition late last year i m a negotiator like you folks he told the crowd he then criticized president obama s nuclear deal with iran a deal opposed by many american jews and mr netanyahu is there anybody that doesn t renegotiate deals in this room mr trump asked perhaps more than any other room i ve ever spoken in mr trump was widely criticized for the remark but inside the room he was met mostly with laughs i thought it was kind of lightly phrased said kenneth bialkin who was in the audience he knew he was in a jewish environment the jeers came from the group when mr trump declined to commit to jerusalem as the undivided capital of israel that coupled with comments he has made about remaining neutral worried some pro israel jews who were not necessarily mollified by mr trump s subsequent claims that he is israel s biggest friend israel benefits from a strong consistent reliable america said william kristol the editor of the weekly standard who has been one of mr trump s most vocal conservative critics i don t think that would be trump s america according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president virtually no one thinks mr trump is anti semitic and the invitation from aipac is a sign that the group is open to hearing what he has to say three of the other four major presidential candidates are also addressing the conference being held in washington only senator bernie sanders declined to attend saying he was going to spend the day campaigning in the west notably sheldon adelson the casino magnate and a major donor to republican and israeli causes said recently that he would back mr trump if he were the nominee and a newspaper that he owns israel hayom has written favorably about mr trump but there is still concern about mr trump s behavior which if not anti semitic is at least seen by many jews as overly accommodating of bigotry the way he dillydallied with david duke basically sent a message that was perceived by many in the jewish community as he s looking for any votes he can get from the hard right said alan m dershowitz the defense lawyer to mr dershowitz the problem is not simply mr trump it is the white supremacists who have rallied around his candidacy it s quite frightening to see who supports him he said ms hicks the campaign spokeswoman said mr trump had disavowed david duke and continues to strongly condemn any groups that share those hateful views and for all of his critics in the jewish world mr trump also has his supporters including sid dinerstein the former chairman of the palm beach county republican party in florida donald trump s relationship with israel and the jews is beyond fabulous mr dinerstein said noting that his wife displayed a trump bumper sticker on the dashboard of her mercedes benz mr dinerstein said he trusted mr trump to negotiate good deals for israel he only negotiates from strength he doesn t know anything else and to make sure that america doesn t get pushed around he and his wife are hardly the lone trump supporters in their predominantly jewish community he said though not everyone is outspoken about it sometimes people come over to me and quietly say sid i never thought i would say this but i m voting for trump mr dinerstein said and i say everybody says
