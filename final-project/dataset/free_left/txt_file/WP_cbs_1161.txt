watch cbsn live by caitlin o kane march 23 2020 4 53 pm cbs news dr anthony fauci has been working overtime the past few weeks as the coronavirus crisis escalated across america between his job as director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid and his crucial position on the white house coronavirus task force fauci has become a strong and authoritative voice for americans in the midst of the pandemic and he s working alongside another strong voice president donald trump in an interview with science magazine fauci admitted he is sort of exhausted but other than that i m good i mean i m not to my knowledge coronavirus infected to my knowledge i haven t been fired he added with a laugh fauci has stood by mr trump s side during almost every white house press conference on the coronavirus and in some cases he s spoken up to correct or dial back certain claims the president has made but in the interview fauci stressed they are working together well to trump s credit even though we disagree on some things he listens fauci said of the commander in chief he goes his own way he has his own style but on substantive issues he does listen to what i say at times it can seem like the words of guidance offered by the two men are like the circles of a venn diagram not identical but overlapping in the middle for instance mr trump has repeatedly referred to covid 19as the chinese virus while fauci sticks to the scientific names and when the president tweeted that an experimental drug combo has a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine fauci followed up with a much more modest assessment explaining that more research will be needed to see if it works against the coronavirus when asked in the interview if he disagrees with things that happen during the press conferences fauci was careful his response well i don t disagree in the substance he told science magazine it is expressed in a way that i would not express it because it could lead to some misunderstanding about what the facts are about a given subject one thing he explicitly disagrees with mr trump s hand shaking we should not be doing that not only that we should be physically separating a bit more on those press conferences fauci said to his credit the vice president is really pushing for physical separation of the task force during meetings fauci added that mr pence enforces the rule of no more than 10 people gathering for their meetings but he acknowledged the crowded stage during press briefings is a different beast i keep saying is there any way we can get a virtual press conference thus far no fauci said but when you re dealing with the white house sometimes you have to say things one two three four times and then it happens so i m going to keep pushing when science magazine reporter jon cohen asked fauci about mr trump s repeated claims that a travel ban on china had a big impact on slowing the spread of the virus to the u s and that china could have shared information about the outbreak months earlier before it was even detected yet the niaid director seemed almost at a loss i know but what do you want me to do i mean seriously jon let s get real what do you want me to do fauci asked rhetorically fauci said advisers try to tell mr trump when his claims don t comport with facts but i can t jump in front of the microphone and push him down ok he said it let s try and get it corrected for the next time fauci said fauci also spoke about the delicate balance of states like california new york and illinois mandating stay at home orders for millions of people while the federal government stop short of calling for a nationwide lockdown it is felt and it isn t me only speaking it s a bunch of people who make the decisions that if you lock down everything now you re going to crash the whole society he said while stressing that high risk areas do need to ratchet it up facui was also asked about a moment at last friday s task force briefing that s gone viral at friday s press conference you put your hands over your face when trump referred to the deep state department a popular conspiracy theory it s even becomean internet meme have you been criticized for what you did cohen asked fauci no comment he responded first published on march 23 2020 4 53 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know get the latest breaking news delivered straight to your inbox copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
