series coronavirus contractors with no experience in food distribution are looking for suppliers on facebook while some food banks scramble to find desperately needed deliveries by isaac arnsdorf the u s response to covid 19 propublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they re published a food relief program championed by president donald trump and his daughter ivanka is relying on some contractors who lack food distribution experience and aren t licensed to deal in fresh fruits and vegetables the contractors on friday began delivering boxes containing fresh produce to food banks and other nonprofits forty nine out of the 159 contractors picked by the u s department of agriculture to deliver boxes containing produce don t have a requisite license from the same agency according to a search of the usda s database using the information released about the contractors some of the contractors are established companies and many food banks told propublica they re successfully and gratefully receiving shipments but other contractors have eclectic backgrounds with little track record in food distribution such as a wedding planner a caterer and a brand builder as a result some food banks are left scrambling for shipments or even callbacks we thought this would work very well and we really needed the food due to rising unemployment and business closings said pamela irvine ceo of feeding america southwest virginia which serves the poorest and most rural counties in that state the usda she said had money and wanted to respond quickly which they should have because you saw all this produce grounded and milk being dumped however they didn t think about how that product should end up on a table somewhere and didn t communicate and didn t have a process in place for bidders to understand are you a public health worker medical provider elected official patient or other covid 19 expert help make sure our

has more information on what to do if you are sick the awards to firms for which no licenses could be found amount to 105 3 million about 15 of the total for produce boxes the usda also hired contractors for boxes containing meat and dairy at a total cost of 1 2 billion for six weeks with the possibility of extending the licenses under the perishable agricultural commodities act or paca are required for wholesalers processors truckers food service firms and anyone else who buys or sells more than 2 000 pounds of fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables a day according to the usda s website much like you need a driver s license to operate a vehicle the law requires that you have a paca license to operate a produce business the agency s website says a paca license is proof to your customers and suppliers that you are a serious business person who can be trusted to honor the terms of your contracts the licenses give vendors a way to resolve payment disputes and many producers won t sell to someone who isn t licensed we don t do business with people without a paca license said noah murguia the ceo of murguia fruit an orange wholesaler in california murguia said he is selling oranges to licensed contractors in the program but doesn t understand why anyone without a license would be allowed to participate to me it s a big joke he said the usda s official solicitation and application form don t mention paca licenses an agency spokesman said contractors that don t already have one will need to get one all proposals were carefully reviewed by a team of contracting and technical experts and contracts made accordingly the usda said in a statement companies will have to submit documentation showing deliveries that meet the contract requirements in order to be paid the agency said trump heralded the program in a tweet on may 9 saying it was implemented at his personal direction starting early next week at my order the usa will be purchasing from our farmers ranchers specialty crop growers 3 billion dollars worth of dairy meat produce for food lines kitchens farmers to family food box great news for all secretarysonny zippyduvall ivanka trump

but also to rebuild to rebuild our economy as we emerge speaking at a kick off event in maryland last week ivanka trump addressed the awards to small operators saying we want to encourage and support a robust ecosystem of distributors across the nation the white house referred questions to the usda the usda has a long established program that buys and distributes food to schools food banks and households totaling 3 3 billion pounds and 3 5 billion in 2019 vendors have to be preapproved and meet precise specifications subscribe to the big story newsletter with millions more americans struggling to buy food as the coronavirus pandemic shutters businesses usda officials decided they needed to be more flexible about vendors products and quantities the development of the farmers to families food box program represents a completely different way of doing business for us chris purdy associate deputy administrator of the usda s commodity procurement program said in an online seminar for applicants but these times call for activities outside of our comfort zone when the program was announced the nonprofit organization feeding america surveyed its nationwide network of 200 food banks about their needs and worked with seven national distributors on how to implement the program but none of those distributors received contracts irvine s organization in southwest virginia committed to taking 3 3 million pounds of produce 2 million pounds of meat and 2 5 million pounds of dairy over six months so far her team has only secured 480 000 pounds of produce 25 000 pounds of meat and no dairy after five days of cold calling distributors who won contracts out of nine distributors contacted three never responded and two didn t know what the program was irvine said this is just going to blow your mind it makes no sense irvine said the only distributor who would ship them produce is sending it cross country from washington state we actually think he called us by mistake bob frampton feeding america southwest virginia s chief operations officer said but he s been great to work with and we took what we could get because we re not crazy here s the dismal equation for food banks panic shopping and hoarding have led to supply shortages volunteers frightened of the virus have stopped showing up and a newly jobless population has sent demand soaring it s not clear why some offbeat bids were successful federal contracts are heavily regulated but the labyrinthine rules and procedures sometimes lead to curious outcomes businesses owned by minorities or veterans routinely have a leg up the usda spokesman said the agency looked for contractors who would support local and regional farmers the contracts also moved much faster than normal companies had only a week to submit bids and the usda announced winners just a week later rejected applicants received a form letter saying some of the most common factors for losing were missing signatures according to a copy of the letter obtained by propublica on a conference call a few days after the contracts were awarded the usda told winning bidders that they would need to apply for a paca license if they didn t already have one according to stephen martin of blueprint foods identified on the usda s announcement as smh2 manufacturing receiving 1 million we never knew about a paca license until they brought it up on a conference call martin whose company typically delivers prepared foods to grocery stores said in an interview what they re asking us to do is a fairly simple thing like what we do anyway except usually we cook things so it s actually easier still there are challenges for companies like martin s that are working on their first government contract we still have to go over how to invoice martin said the notion that they built the plane in the air is accurate some upstanding companies that have experience with government contracts were denied on mistaken grounds while winning bidders who don t have their own warehouses staff and distributions channels are now looking for subcontractors according to tom stenzel ceo of the united fresh produce association this is not sour grapes from those that may not have been awarded this is a genuine effort to ensure integrity and confidence in the program and that fresh produce actually gets to those in need in an efficient and cost effective way stenzel said in a letter to usda leaders three companies that received a total of 6 million in contracts are licensed but are involved in business disputes that were reported to the usda according to the agency s public data doug peterson the ceo of aggrigator which received a contract for 2 6 million said the company is trying to resolve its five disputes and the complaints never came up in the bidding process peterson said the company is producing 4 000 boxes a day and started deliveries on saturday a california avocado grower named ben holtz received a contract for 40 million more than any other company without a paca license holtz posted on facebook looking to buy truckloads of usda carrots usa cucumber usa apples usa sweet potatoes usa onions usa green bell peppers usa pears usa tomatoes if your farm or shed or packing operation wants orders pm me one commenter asked holtz if his company is in the produce blue book an industry standard business directory that rates the creditworthiness of produce suppliers without that assurance the commenter wanted to know if holtz would be paying cash upfront holtz replied huh holtz has since made a website and said he has more than 10 000 orders in a phone interview he said he s already delivered more than 2 200 boxes and has thousands more on the way this isn t foreign to me holtz said in a phone interview i have lots of experience running jobs this is just a job i m a fourth generation avocado grower i can talk produce i know how things get to where they need to be i know how to run jobs with manpower and people with limits and constraints and financing it s going to take everything and everybody i ve ever known to pull this off and we re doing it we re off to the races holtz was surprised to win a contract at the top of the range he applied for for up to 1 million boxes getting up to seven digits was just kind of cool looking he said i put it down and they said all right holtz doesn t have a paca license but said he has applied for one and asked the usda to expedite it holtz s lack of a license and absence from the produce blue book have made some vendors wary of him holtz said but he said he relies on industry contacts or pays cash if you want to know anything about me and my reputation call up anyone in the california avocado world and they will know my name he said the usda awarded a 39 1 million contract including 6 25 million for produce to cre8ad8 llc pronounced create a date a wedding and event planner in san antonio we had no idea we d be asked to help on this level ceo gregorio palomino said in a facebook post he does not have a paca license and said he applied last week palomino told the san antonio express news that the job isn t that different from his usual work we knew that we easily could do this because instead of putting tchotchkes in a bag that is going to go to a conference attendee this is the same exact thing except it s just food going into a box he told the newspaper in a statement palomino said he s in an initial planning phase and his next steps will be hiring up to 100 people and assigning roles and tasks this is the largest contract
