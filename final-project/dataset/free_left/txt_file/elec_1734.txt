advertisement supported by by adam nagourney philadelphia few conventions were as successful as when democrats gathered in 1992 in new york to nominate bill clinton for president there was the hollywood produced man from hope video a dramatic midtown manhattan stroll by bill and hillary clinton from macy s to madison square garden and a six day post convention bus caravan that drew crowds all the way through its end in st louis as mrs clinton arrives here for her own nominating convention she faces many of the same problems her husband encountered in 1992 she too is damaged after a bruising campaign and shadowed by a cloud of mistrust stirred by her actions while mr clinton was a relatively new if battered face ready for his reintroduction in 1992 mrs clinton is a political institution with one exception she has spoken at every democratic national convention since 1996 if you don t know the clintons by now you are never going to know them said newt gingrich a former house speaker donald j trump entered the republican national convention last week in cleveland with the opportunity to recast the way americans viewed him a moment he arguably failed to seize but mrs clinton s task in philadelphia is decidedly harder she has been a fixture on the american political scene for a generation subjected to endless attacks examination and analysis she is a proxy in debates over feminism and political power and a recurring subject of parody on saturday night live views about her particularly on issues of trust after the f b i investigation into her handling of emails as secretary of state are seared in place with many voters pollsters say after 25 years her days of reinventing herself are almost surely gone and yet these four nights in the public eye particularly coming after mr trump s often chaotic convention in cleveland offer her a chance to persuade important segments of the electorate to take another look at her to consider parts of her life that have been lost in the glare of scandals and investigation and to judge her candidacy in contrast with the dark image mr trump presented last week of himself and the nation that would start with supporters of senator bernie sanders of vermont many of whom particularly younger ones learned much of what they know about mrs clinton through the prism of mr sanders s attacks and have been steadfast in their opposition to her potentially all the more so after her choice of senator tim kaine of virginia a moderate as her running mate but just as crucially mrs clinton might also find an audience with independent voters struggling between two candidates they do not like who will have an opportunity after this week to make a direct comparison between the visions being offered by mrs clinton and mr trump for nearly a year mrs clinton has struggled to answer questions about her use of a private email server particularly after her conduct was excoriated by the f b i republicans have accused her of negligence criminal mishandling of classified information and even treason rightly or wrongly the most recent controversy is what has defined her most she is someone with a long record in public life but people forget said david greenberg a history and journalism professor at rutgers university younger voters who don t have the memory or older voters with short memories from that perspective there is much that mrs clinton may be able to do as she controls the convention stage for the next four nights a parade of democratic stars including a sitting president a former president and mr sanders stand ready to offer a remedial course in hillary clinton we have a cavalry who are fully armed said david plouffe who managed barack obama s campaign in 2008 for trump it was all on him mrs clinton also has the advantages of following the turbulent republican gathering and of having a team far more experienced than mr trump s at producing sophisticated conventions giving her an opportunity to contrast a presumably more united party and a more consistent message with what was displayed in cleveland rob reiner a hollywood director and actor who is a longtime supporter of mrs clinton said she should use the convention to tell the story of her life she has been an advocate her entire life for women for children for all the causes that we care about he said i know she has a lot of baggage and all that stuff he added but a lot of that is unfair so what might mrs clinton do uniting the party is the easy part yes she needs to galvanize her party entering the general election and mrs clinton may be aided greatly both by mr sanders who is set to trumpet his endorsement of her and by mr trump who has proved to be a great mobilizing force for democrats but unity is not enough considering the passion that mr trump s supporters have shown mrs clinton who is not known for her ability to light up a room would be well advised to figure out a way to have democrats to borrow a phrase fired up and ready to go the one thing that needs to happen coming out of the democratic convention is for the obama coalition being very enthused about her candidacy not just beating trump mr plouffe said she has to give a speech that makes people as excited about her as they are about beating donald trump senator chuck schumer of new york a democrat who served with mrs clinton in the senate said the convention would offer her an opportunity to debunk what he called the conservative caricature of her the right wing media has tried to portray her as something she s not mr schumer said the convention is a great way to undo some of that media image people will see her up close they will see her the way she is i think their minds are open age is a virtue the demographic differences between clinton and sanders supporters underline one of mrs clinton s biggest challenges he crushed her among younger voters whom she will need in november the convention will give her a shot at winning them back even before arriving here mrs clinton had taken steps to close that gap by among other things moving toward mr sanders s position in favor of free tuition at public colleges there are other ways she can extend her appeal eighty percent of her speakers should be under 40 mr gingrich said she has to convince the younger generation that she is an acceptable leader for that generation younger voters have much to learn about mrs clinton be it her record in the senate or her years as first lady an added bonus for mrs clinton many of them have managed to come this far in life without knowing the political meaning of the word whitewater one thing to watch whether mrs clinton avoids decades old references like her reaching back to voodoo economics a 36 year old attack line that george bush used on ronald reagan at the event this month where mr sanders endorsed her do not forget trump conventions are about drawing contrasts and mrs clinton has shown no reluctance to highlight her differences with mr trump philadelphia will provide an enormous stage to refine those arguments and respond specifically to how mr trump tried to sell himself to voters in cleveland particularly on immigration and the threats of terrorism and crime she s in a position where she can be the safer choice said stuart stevens a republican consultant who ran mitt romney s campaign for president in 2012 in times of instability voters tend to look for safety and mrs clinton will benefit from timing if the back to back conventions somewhat resemble a slow motion debate between the candidates mr trump has had his say and mrs clinton can make a closing argument that if done right could stick in the minds of many voters for her the convention speech is the opportunity to have the final two words of the summer political season said steve schmidt a senior adviser to john mccain when he ran for president in 2008 the race is going to freeze in place a couple of weeks after those conventions advertisement
