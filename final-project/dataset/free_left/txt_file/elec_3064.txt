 2016 the first in the nation primary state is also first in polling volatility by steven shepard 02 05 2016 05 11 am est recent polls indicate that marco rubio the first term florida senator who placed third in iowa is the early beneficiary of the post caucuses momentum ap photo pollsters in iowa are searching for answers after they failed to predict ted cruz s victory over donald trump and marco rubio it might even be worse next week in new hampshire pollsters and other observers surveyed by politico this week pointed to a number of reasons why new hampshire is such a uniquely difficult state to poll chief among them the volatility in the electorate that persists right up until voting begins advertisement people are moving around from candidate to candidate said dante scala an assistant professor at the university of new hampshire and author of a book on the state s first in the nation primary i think if you called the same person in two successive nights you might get two different answers of who they like recent polls indicate that rubio the first term florida senator who placed third in iowa is the early beneficiary of the post caucuses momentum early tracking polls a daily tracker launched this week by the university of massachusetts lowell and a small sample post iowa survey from the university of new hampshire show rubio s numbers ticking up while the changes aren t huge at the moment they are significant in this regard rubio is seeking to parlay his momentum to break away from a pack of candidates who had been jockeying for second place behind trump a group that includes cruz jeb bush john kasich and chris christie the early post iowa surveys show cruz slightly ahead of bush and kasich with christie sagging lower 2016 by kyle cheney but before rubio starts writing his victory speech monday night it s worth recalling the most famous example of the failure of pre election surveys to predict the outcome of the new hampshire primary on jan 3 2008 the day of the iowa caucuses hillary clinton led barack obama by 7 points in the realclearpolitics average of new hampshire polls and then obama won iowa despite just four days separating iowa and new hampshire obama quickly surged in the polls opening up an 8 3 point lead in the final rcp average but something happened on the way to an obama sweep of the first two states clinton stormed from behind in the race s final 24 hours leading pollsters including the industry s professional organization the american association for public opinion research to conduct thorough reviews of industry practices their most basic conclusion polls that stop days before the primary miss important shifts in voter preference that occur right up until election day late deciders haunt everybody scala said this week recalling his expectation in 2008 that obama would run away with the primary i remember watching the actual returns come in and realizing half an hour in that wasn t going to happen it s a lesson the pollsters who survey new hampshire are taking to heart late deciding voters are the biggest reason why pollsters are lowering expectations that the pre primary surveys will match the results next tuesday we expect way too much of polls more than they could possibly deliver said university of new hampshire pollster andy smith who is conducting surveys for cnn and manchester s wmur tv we re asking people what they plan to do and they really don t know these people really are volatile added monmouth university pollster patrick murray they really are undecided even if they pick a candidate today or tomorrow they can change their mind the seven day interval between the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary last year while longer than 2008 also poses challenges it comes very soon after iowa which is a major news event warned steve koczela the president of the massinc polling group which polls the state for wbur fm the boston area npr affiliate any time you do a poll right after a major news event you can expect changes and the new hampshire primary comes right during those changes by hadas gold that leaves those polling new hampshire with a limited window they want to measure changes since iowa but the news organizations that commission those polls don t necessarily want to wait until the last minute besides some pollsters believe releasing horse race polls on election day is an unethical practice that could unfairly influence results massinc s koczela said the horse race is only one reason why news organizations commission polls a more important purpose he said is to provide a meaningful narrative of the campaign even if that means leaving the field earlier and undermining the survey s chances of more closely matching the election results in terms of accuracy it would be nice to poll right up until the very last minute said koczela but there are other things that are important other than accuracy that s an issue in all elections and late deciders are a more acute problem in primaries where voters generally like most of the candidates and aren t making their decisions based on partisan cues as in general elections the timing of these surveys also highlights a common complaint among pollsters too much attention is paid to the horse race and their surveys are mostly being used to predict the results of elections the public wants to know what the score is unh s smith said but i think it behooves public opinion researchers that we try to tell the public the real story of what s going on late deciders aren t the only challenge facing new hampshire pollsters some cited the state s open primary system in which unaffiliated voters can participate in either party s primary koczela pointed to the past two presidential races without an incumbent as evidence of how undeclared voters can shift in 2000 he said many of them participated in the republican race to back arizona sen john mccain over george w bush but in 2008 the democratic race was more compelling and independents were more likely to pull ballots in the obama clinton contest it means the electorate is quite different each time said koczela there s not a repeat of how things looked in a previous elections smith however insists koczela and others are making too much of the independent factor most of them are partisans he said they vote consistently partisan and vote consistently in their party s primary another complication the sheer number of polls and calls from campaigns in the state has left voters dreading the ringing of their telephones people in new hampshire are inundated with calls and information and requests on their time said umass lowell pollster joshua dyck it s not only pollsters calling voters it s also campaigns calling voters by gabriel debenedetti yet there are also ways in which polling new hampshire is an easier endeavor than iowa pollsters cited the extremely high turnout rates for presidential primaries in new hampshire which can draw more than half the eligible voters in iowa on the other hand fewer than one in five active voters participated in monday s caucuses pollsters said that makes it easier to ensure that they aren t including too many non voters in their surveys turnout here is so high said smith turnout in 2008 for example was 54 percent of voting age residents no other state has anything like that pollsters are hoping they can avoid another in a long line of embarrassing misses in new hampshire ronald reagan won a landslide victory over george h w bush in 1980 but the polls overstated the former california governor s advantage walter mondale led gary hart in the polls in 1984 after romping in iowa but hart pulled the upset in new hampshire in 1988 gallup showed kansas sen bob dole entering the new hampshire primary with an 8 point lead over bush dole was up by 7 to 10 points marist college pollster lee miringoff recalled this week everybody was saying dole on a roll but bush won by 9 points leaving pollsters again to conclude that they should have kept polling to the end gallup left the field at 4 p m on the sunday before the tuesday primary i was dismayed about the fact that we didn t put enough emphasis on the potential for things to turn around literally overnight the late andrew kohut then the president of the gallup organization told the new york times after the primary there s no guarantee that there will be a similar last minute shift in either primary this year unh s smith recalled then massachusetts sen john kerry s victory in the state 12 years ago when kerry overtook former vermont gov howard dean in the polls about a week before the primary and never looked back we got it dead right in 2004 he said i thought i was a genius
