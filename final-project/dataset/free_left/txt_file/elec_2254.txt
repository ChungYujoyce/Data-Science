advertisement supported by political memo by matt flegenheimer and jonathan martin senator ted cruz has long cheered donald j trump s presence in the republican presidential field thanking him for focusing national attention on issues like border security speaking to donors in new york city on wednesday mr cruz suggested a more strategic reason to be grateful mr trump is bending the race in mr cruz s direction he has framed the central narrative of this primary as who will stand up to washington mr cruz of texas said at the private fund raiser echoing remarks he has made publicly now if that s the central narrative the natural next question is o k who has stood up to washington mr trump in this view has taken a machete through the brush for mr cruz allowing him to rise quietly despite his own reputation for bombast while mr trump absorbs the scrutiny a front runner attracts and eventually peters out as mr cruz has wagered at the same time in an election season of intense outsider fervor mr cruz seems to have found through mr trump support for his case that his own government experience railing against leadership in both parties should be seen as a genuine asset let me point out he said last month creating a rare public contrast with his rival when it comes to standing up to washington i was doing it long before mr trump was running for president it is at least partly this belief that mr trump has made the case for mr cruz without intending to that seems to explain mr cruz s conspicuous public deference to mr trump though avoiding his attacks is surely another consideration the period of total harmony appears to be over mr cruz according to an audio recording from wednesday s fund raiser said mr trump was facing a challenging question about whether he had the judgment to be president on friday morning mr trump took note on twitter somewhat gently by his standards he will fall like all others mr trump said will be easy and at a rally in des moines mr trump tweaked mr cruz on a critical local issue his opposition to subsidies favored by the ethanol industry oil gives him a lot of money mr trump said ominously he also appeared to take a swipe at the senator s faith i do like ted cruz but not a lot of evangelicals come out of cuba in all fairness he said donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention still asked if he would consider naming mr cruz as his vice president or nominating him to the supreme court mr trump said admiringly that he had things in mind for ted noting that other candidates had not been as kind to him mr cruz s campaign declined to comment on mr trump s remarks at the rally on twitter hours earlier mr cruz struck a diplomatic tone the establishment s only hope trump me in a cage match he said sorry to disappoint realdonaldtrump is terrific dealwithit mr cruz and his allies believe that he stands to benefit the most from any collapse by mr trump according to a new york times cbs news poll this week mr cruz is the preferred second choice of 26 percent of trump supporters the most of anyone in the field yet for mr cruz patience is risky mr cruz s standing has risen nationally and he has emerged as a force in iowa leading in one recent survey and securing several important endorsements but he continues to trail mr trump typically by double digit margins in most state and national polls it is also unclear if mr trump s supporters including the many who have limited experience in republican primaries will prove transferable if mr trump exits the race one of cruz s assumptions is that all those voters will stay in the primary electorate david winston a republican pollster said we just don t know if that s the case edward j rollins a veteran republican strategist said mr cruz stood to gain little from confronting mr trump more directly trump s either going to self destruct or not pay attention to the details you need to pay attention to mr rollins said with mr trump in the race he added cruz is not the guy everybody s attacking mr cruz appears confident in what he openly described at the fund raiser this week as his bear hug approach suggesting that he has given deep thought about how to position himself relative to mr trump and the angry republican electorate in a recent interview he cited his experience framing the narrative in law and politics he said he had long focused intently on sun tzu s principle that every battle is won before it is fought it is won by choosing the terrain on which the battle is fought he said mr cruz also seems intent on avoiding returning fire at mr trump and aiding a third candidate in the race a dynamic with some historical precedent in 2004 sniping between howard dean and richard a gephardt helped john kerry come from behind to win the iowa democratic caucus in the interview mr cruz indicated that he would be willing to contrast himself with mr trump if necessary on policy grounds he has done so gingerly at times most notably after mr trump s call to ban muslims from entering the united states mr cruz underscored that his experience taking on the washington establishment was markedly different from anyone else s in the race asked if that included mr trump mr cruz repeated himself advertisement
