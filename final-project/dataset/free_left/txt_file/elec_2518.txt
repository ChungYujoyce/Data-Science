on issues of common cause especially issues as essential as the fight against cancer biden spokesperson bill russo told abc news earlier this year one of the first challenges to biden s candidacy will be answering tough questions on allegations from some women who have said that the former vice president made them feel uncomfortable in past interactions by touching them without their permission on wednesday his democratic rival sen kirsten gillibrand of new york signaled that biden is going to have to directly answer to voters on the allegations this will be biden s third run for president he previously ran in 1988 and 2008 before serving as vice president to barack obama biden will likely campaign on his connection to the former president though a source familiar with obama s thinking tells abc news that its unlikely he will throw his support behind a specific candidate this early in the primary process but obama did have praise for his former running mate after his announcement president obama has long said that selecting joe biden as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made he relied on the vice president s knowledge insight and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency the two forged a special bond over the last 10 years and remain close today katie hill a spokesperson for obama told abc news in a statement the republican national committee is already taking aim at biden s candidacy saying the country doesn t need eight more years of biden joe biden has been running for president and losing since the 80s
