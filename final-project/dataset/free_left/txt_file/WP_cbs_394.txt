watch cbsn live by rachel layne july 1 2019 4 21 pm moneywatch president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping over the weekendhit the pause button on their trade war and agreed to resume discussions that means u s companies and consumers bracing to pay more for everything from mobile phones to clothing to fireworks are getting a reprieve on footing the bill for 300 billion in tariffs on chinese goods threatened by mr trump for now but a pause does not a trade agreement make and talks have collapsed before most recently in may indeed many trade experts remain skeptical a long term agreement will be reached anytime soon here s a look at what happened and what s next heading into the trump xi meeting this weekend at the g20 summit in japan trade experts gave the biggest odds to a pause in the escalation of tariffs and other tit for tat moves by both countries rather than an outright agreement and sure enough mr trump said the u s would put off moving forward on 300 billion in planned tariffs on imported chinese goods some observers including the washington post s heather long noted china got nearly all of what it wanted from its meeting with mr trump in addition to the tariffs he agreed to ease some restrictions on chinese telecom huawei from doing business with u s tech companies and china agreed to buy more farm products the sides didn t set a schedule for negotiations we have no assurances and again the president himself said several times we want quality talks there s no timeline here the issue is quality not speed white house economic adviser larry kudlow told margaret brennan on cbs face the nation this sunday morgan stanley economists on sunday said the pause doesn t do enough to quash signs of a slowing global economy and shore up corporate confidence in part because there s no clear path to an agreement as things stand we lack clarity on whether real progress was achieved on the sticking points that caused talks to break down in the first place morgan stanley chief economist chetan ahya said in a note the last time mr trump and xi met in early december at a g20 gathering in buenos aires argentina they also reached a cease fire that injected new life into the talks but the momentum didn t last and the discussions collapsed in may mr trump then raised the 10 tariffs he had imposed on 200 billion in chinese goods to 25 those tariffs remain and will cost u s households 106 billion a year or 831 for the average family new york fed researchers found china this weekend also left its counter tariffs in place contrary to what mr trump has claimed u s companies not exporting countries pay tariffs on goods and services imported from china and elsewhere while some firms can absorb the higher costs most consumer and tech companies opt to push at least some of the increased expense onto consumers that means higher prices pulling back from the brink of further tariff escalation is a good sign for retailers and their customers and we look forward to continued progress in the talks with china so that further tariffs can be avoided and existing ones lifted the national retail federation s david french said in a press release this weekend the basic fight between the two countries hasn t changed raymond james analyst ed mills pointed out in a note to investors tariff escalations and tech restrictions still remain extremely likely over the coming weeks months he wrote but that threat will likely be discounted potentially significantly by the market until signs emerge of trump seeking to restart the fight the latest truce might mean no new tariffs until the end of 2019 at least if talks stall height securities analyst clayton allen wrote in a note he forecast a growing possibility that the larger talks with china continue with no real headway until the 2020 election china and the u s are sparring over the trump administration s allegations that beijing steals technology and coerces foreign companies into handing over trade secrets china denies this the u s has also tried to rally other nations to not use chinese telecom firm huawei s gear in their upcoming 5g systems branding the company a national security threat the white house also barred huawei from buying american technology without u s government approval mr trump said saturday he would allow u s companies to sell their products to huawei but he wasn t yet willing to remove the company from a trade blacklist the president s easing of pressure on hauwei has already drawn pushback from some in congress if president trump has in fact bargained away the recent restrictions on huawei then we will have to get those restrictions put back in place through legislation senator marco rubio r florida tweeted on saturday economic adviser kudlow told face the nation that huawei is still subject to restrictions regarding doing business with u s firms and gave few details on how that might change there was no explanation of how this would work other than a throwaway line that additional work must be done height securities allen wrote the white house might grant huawei a 90 day temporary license to do business with some u s firms for some products allen speculated the u s economy has now grown for 121 consecutive months making this the country s longest expansion ever yet economists remain concerned that a recession is on the horizon one of the biggest downside factors remains the trump administration s protectionist policies and the trade war with china paused or not though the u s economy is still growing a key
