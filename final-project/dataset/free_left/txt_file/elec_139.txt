 2016 sanders consistently beats donald trump in the polls it s getting harder to overlook by steven shepard 05 24 2016 05 25 am edt bernie sanders shakes hands with audience members after speaking at a campaign rally at great bay community college on feb 7 in portsmouth new hampshire getty for months bernie sanders and his supporters have pointed to polls that show him running comfortably ahead of donald trump in november but now that hillary clinton s lead over trump has disappeared and the two likely nominees are now running neck and neck in national polls his argument is gaining new resonance clinton and her campaign argue that the vermont senator hasn t undergone the kind of scrutiny that clinton and trump have and that his poll numbers are over inflated compared to candidates who have faced intense political attacks from the other party advertisement the data remain unequivocal however the latest averages from huffpost pollster give clinton a just less than 2 point advantage over trump while sanders who is virtually certain to finish well behind clinton in pledged delegates leads trump by 10 points trump has narrowed clinton s lead by 5 points since the end of april while he s only chipped 2 points off sanders edge moreover there s evidence that clinton will face challenges uniting democrats the way trump has brought republicans together since eliminating his opponents sanders backers appear increasingly hostile to clinton polls show especially those voters who currently favor sanders over trump but say they would defect to the republican if clinton is the democratic nominee the debate isn t just academic part of sanders last ditch argument to the unpledged superdelegates he d need to win over to have any hope of winning the democratic nomination is that they should consider which candidate would run best against trump before making their choice by nolan d mccaskill virtually every poll taken in the last two months has me doing better against trump than hillary clinton sanders said on cnn on sunday clinton and her campaign have dismissed that argument repeatedly over the past few months maintaining that sanders hasn t been assailed as clinton has clinton hasn t gone negative on sanders with paid media thus far and with the former secretary of state poised to emerge as the pledged delegate leader at the end of the voting next month it s unlikely sanders will be the subject of attack ads over the next three weeks i don t think he s had a single negative ad ever run against him clinton said sunday on nbc s meet the press and that s fine but we know what we re going into and we understand what it s going to take to win in the fall three polls conducted last week confirm sanders advantage in the general election an nbc news wall street journal poll released on sunday showed clinton leading trump by 3 points 46 percent to 43 percent sanders on the other hand had a commanding 15 point advantage 54 percent to 39 percent last week a fox news poll showed clinton trailing trump by 3 points but sanders ahead by 4 points a cbs news new york times poll was better for clinton showing her leading trump by 6 points but sanders was 13 points clear of trump that survey showed some pollsters in fact aren t even asking about a potential sanders trump matchup an abc news washington post poll out this weekend didn t include sanders in the general election trial heats the poll matched clinton against trump showing trump leading clinton among registered voters 46 percent to 44 percent then added a hypothetical three way race including 2012 gop nominee mitt romney as an independent candidate the ballot test isn t the only survey data point pointing to sanders strong position and the shortcomings of both trump and clinton according to huffpost pollster sanders average image rating stands at 50 percent favorable and 41 percent unfavorable that s far better than the historically poor ratings for trump 39 percent favorable 57 percent unfavorable and clinton 41 percent favorable 55 percent unfavorable clinton has one distinct advantage over sanders more democrats want her to be the party s nominee a finding reflected not just in election returns over the past five months but also in more recent national polling clinton has a 12 point lead in the latest polls measuring the preferences of democrats nationally but increasingly there are warning signs that clinton could struggle to bring those sanders supporters into the fold while about two thirds of sanders backers in the nbc news wall street journal poll say they would vote for clinton over trump clinton s image rating stands at only 38 percent positive 41 percent negative and last week s nbc news surveymonkey poll an online large sample survey that allows for analysis of smaller subgroups profiles the small but significant pool of voters who are choosing sanders over trump but defect to trump over clinton by hadas gold the data suggest it will be difficult for clinton to win them over ninety one percent of these sanders trump voters have an unfavorable opinion of clinton including a staggering 73 percent who have a strongly unfavorable opinion democrats are adamant that clinton will be able to unify the party after she clinches the nomination democratic pollster geoff garin who is advising the pro clinton super pac priorities usa told politico last week that it s certain that clinton would benefit from putting the intraparty divisiveness behind her in the same way that trump has benefited from that on his side but it s not clear that clinton has the room to grow that trump did after he knocked out his gop rivals trump is managing to win from 80 percent to 90 percent of self identified republicans in the polls roughly equal to clinton s share of the democratic vote sanders isn t beating trump because he s winning more democrats polls show he s winning over more independents and even a few republicans still trump has mostly unified the gop against steep odds even as late as the indiana primary earlier this month 42 percent of gop primary voters said they would be scared or concerned if trump were elected president and a number of prominent republicans including house speaker paul ryan still haven t expressed public support for trump s candidacy for democrats pre election surveys and exit polls alike have shown a greater inclination for unity than their republican counterparts but as sanders continues to press his argument and trump runs neck and neck with clinton the process of bringing sanders voters into the fold becomes more difficult for clinton as she seeks to reclaim her polling lead over trump headed into the summer missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico
