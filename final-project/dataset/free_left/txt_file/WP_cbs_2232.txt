60 minutes speaks to a doctor who says nyc hospitals are like hell on earth as waves of patients suffering from covid 19 come through their doors and a nurse says the u s is treating the virus with equipment that lags behind what s being used in other countries the united states has the tragic distinction of having the highest daily death toll from covid 19 anywhere on earth last week saw nearly 2 000 americans die at home or in hospitals each day thousands of medical workers are falling ill pulled from the frontlines just when we need them most so far more than 50 have died nationwide for doctors and nurses a steady supply of personal protective equipment ppe can be a lifesaver but there are massive shortages in those supplies how did the wealthiest most medically advanced nation on earth wind up so utterly unprepared to confront this pandemic we spoke with the combative white house official in charge of procuring ppe and doctors and nurses risking their lives without the same protective gear many of their counterparts around the world have dr sheldon teperman every hospital in new york city is teeming with this virus right in my place there are hundreds and hundreds of patients many many dozens of intubated sick covid patients in the average place in new york city whether it s nyu cornell presbyterian northwell stony brook there are hundreds of intubated covid patients and a lot of people are dying dr sheldon teperman is chief trauma surgeon at jacobi medical center in the bronx the borough has one of the highest covid 19 death rates on earth he runs four intensive care units full of critically ill patients his days he told us seem endless it s the same in hospitals all over new york city cross town at brooklyn hospital center overworked doctors and nurses with limited protective gear some wearing trash bags bound with tape race from emergency to emergency at wyckoff hospital in brooklyn body bags line the hallway one doctor called conditions there catastrophic after another 16 hour day jacobi medical center s dr teperman came to us exhausted we maintained social distance each in a different new york city location dr sheldon teperman so covid comes in waves it comes in waves so it could be manageable in the emergency room at a given moment and then we re hit with a terrible wave bill whitaker when that wave washes in what is it like in the er dr sheldon teperman so emergency medicine physicians and nurses they ve gotta stare into the faces of these very scared citizens in new york and at a certain point when they can no longer breathe for themselves they have to have a tube put down their throat and they have to be put on the ventilator bill whitaker you told us it was like hell on earth dr sheldon teperman yeah so i m you know i m calibrating what i m saying to here right we people need to stay home new york city is on fire our neighbors are dying health care workers are being affected right now you know my boss my second in command my nephew my senior nurse second senior nurse bill whitaker the people you just mentioned have all fallen ill from covid 19 dr sheldon teperman yes yes and some of them are quite sick dr teperman and his colleagues are repeatedly exposed he told us he sees the virus in hot zones around the hospital dr sheldon teperman i m speaking metaphorically that i see the virus it s also a protective mechanism there are moments in the hospital you know where the virus conceivably is pluming into the air because a procedure is being done that creates an aerosolizing of the virus i mean that s just a fact those are the true n95 moments n 95 s are the coin of the realm in this crisis respirator masks that filter 95 of airborne particles just as important though are the gloves gowns goggles face shields surgical masks all ppe designed to be discarded after every encounter with an infected patient bill whitaker do you have enough masks kelley cabrera no bill whitaker do you have enough face shields kelley cabrera no bill whitaker gowns kelley cabrera no kelley cabrera is an emergency room nurse at jacobi kelley cabrera we want to help our patients and we want to do it safely who led a protest to draw attention to the lack of ppe at hospitals nationwide the problem has gotten so bad there s a hashtag get me ppe on twitter with posts like i m a physician at a new york city hospital and this is the ppe i was just handed for my shift a yankee souvenir rain poncho i m a physician at a hospital in nyc and this is the ppe i was just handed for my shift our federal government has completely failed its health care workers getusppe pic twitter com beh11ra7ee kelley cabrera look my neck is exposed i m wearing a reused mask i have another one covering it cabrebra has been filming video diaries but says she s speaking out reluctantly we conducted the interview remotely kelley cabrera every healthcare worker infection every healthcare worker death is preventable bill whitaker how do you feel about going into work every day are you safe kelley cabrera no absolutely not if you do a simple google search look at what other countries are wearing in comparison to us i mean it makes i mean it makes sense that we re getting infected how could we expect not to more than 900 doctors and nurses in boston have tested positive for covid 19 yet as of last week in hong kong where masks are not reused there were no reported infections of hospital workers kelley cabrera prior to this prior to coronavirus we would have been reprimanded for doing the things that we re doing now we re walking around with medical waste from room to room from patient to patient bill whitaker did i hear you say you re walking around from room to room wearing medical waste kelley cabrera that s correct that s what it is we re wearing stuff that is it s dirty the fact that we re given a mask to wear for five days it s it s wrong one of her fellow nurses freda ocran has died another was put on life support and a young er doctor was admitted to the icu bill whitaker and yet you go back to that hospital every single day kelley cabrera if we don t go who s gonna take care of these patients i mean i think we re getting to a spot where where people are are really i mean it s a very difficult moral question you know it s like do i not show up to work and protect myself or do i show up with and do the best that i can with what i have to help other people a lot of us are speaking out because we realize that this problem is so much bigger than our individual hospitals cabrera says she and her fellow nurses are skeptical about the shifting centers for disease control guidance on the use of personal protective equipment when treating patients with covid 19 kelley cabrera we re looking to the cdc for answers and initially they had certain recommendations for what we should wear we watched those recommendations be scaled back not based on science not because miraculously coronavirus wasn t as contagious they scaled those back because they knew that we didn t have the proper supplies peter navarro the biggest lesson here is make this stuff here economist peter navarro is special assistant to president trump for trade and manufacturing tasked with getting ppe to america s medical workers peter navarro we wouldn t be having this problem if we had the domestic production of essential medicines medical countermeasures medical supplies like masks and medical equipment like ventilators if we made it here we wouldn t be faced with this that was that was the original sin navarro spoke to us from washington d c with the strategic national stockpile now depleted he was put in charge of the defense production act to mobilize american industry to meet the demand for medical supplies bill whitaker i m here in new york and we hear daily the hospitals are running out of masks they re running out of gowns they re running out of gloves my question is how did we the united states the most powerful the wealthiest country on earth get blindsided like this peter navarro it s the global globalization of production through multinational corporations who salute no flag who love cheap sweatshop labor and who love the massive subsidies that the chinese government throws at production to bring it from here to there navarro is an architect of the trump administration s trade war with china and is one of the biggest proponents of its america first policies now in the wake of the outbreak more than 70 countries across the world are restricting the export of products u s doctors and nurses desperately need to treat covid 19 bill whitaker we have a nurse that we ve been speaking to the nurse asked what has taken you so long peter navarro what is taking bill whitaker you re talking about ramping up and the defense production act and she s on the front lines having to reuse masks and gowns peter navarro we re moving in trump time which is to say as swiftly as possible if you look at the trajectory of events we we we we learn about the potential for a pandemic we re not sure what the scope of it will be the trump administration starts rapidly mobilizing but but it this this is the 500 year flood and it takes time bill whitaker i have seen reports that the intelligence community was notifying the administration back in january that this was happening peter navarro this is like like the fake news stuff it s like okay somebody said bill whitaker it s not fake news sir peter navarro it s like show me the money here what exactly did they say did they say there s gonna be a global pandemic that s gonna shut down the entire global economy well it turns out navarro himself said almost exactly that a few days after our interview the news site axios published this memo navarro wrote in late january in which he warned the white house national security council the china born virus could cause a global pandemic take a half million american souls and cost the economy 5 7 trillion he told us he does not contest its authenticity peter navarro no apologies here from this administration we are we are doing better and more than any other president could ve done bill whitaker sir this is the best you can peter navarro you say this is the best you can it s like oh somebody coulda done better really who coulda done better on this i mean really think about this kelley cabrera and i know it s a pandemic and we it s just really hard for us to accept the fact that this is the best that we can do i wouldn t wish this upon anybody we re running out of supplies that it s not just the ppe and ventilators we re running out of iv pumps we re running out of stuff that we never ran out of before and it is unacceptable that in the united states of america the richest country in the world we are struggling like this this week was one of the worst in new york s history covid 19 patients filled hospitals and morgues in numbers that dwarfed 9 11 the trump administration says it s moving heaven and earth to get medical supplies here heaven can wait new york can t bill whitaker the president did say that the problem with some people is just no matter how much you give them they say it s never enough dr sheldon teperman well laugh i would say come visit we re taking care of just in our system america s largest public hospital system thousands and thousands and thousands of covid positive patients so yeah there s never gonna be enough keep it comin because you don t wanna go into those rooms do you we re gonna go into those rooms we just need to be properly protected produced by sam hornblower and graham messick associate producer jack weingart broadcast associates mabel kabani and emilio almonte edited by craig crawford
