advertisement supported by multiple democratic candidates said they expected to finish strong in the caucuses though official results appeared to be a ways off by the new york times the release of iowa caucus results was delayed after inconsistencies in the reporting of data this is not a hack or an intrusion said a spokeswoman for the state democratic party the party is using photos of results and a paper trail to validate the results a frustrated pack of democratic presidential candidates sought to turn the mood of chaos to their own advantage tuesday morning as they barreled toward the next nominating contest in new hampshire there are 41 delegates up for grabs a tiny fraction of the 1 991 delegates needed to win the democratic presidential nomination troy price the chairman of the iowa democratic party said shortly after 1 a m that he expected to have caucus results to report later today after party officials had manually tallied the data on a brief conference call with reporters mr price stressed that the caucus results were being delayed because of problems reporting delegate totals from the more than 1 600 precincts not because the system had been hacked this is taking longer than expected he said the system is in place to make sure we can report results with full confidence several hours after the caucuses ended the state party still has not publicly reported any results mr price did not take questions and the call ended after he finished reading his statement he said the system the party put in place for 2020 which requires written records for each precinct s results was implemented in case such a communications breakdown took place we have backups in place for this reason he said we are updating campaigns and will continue to provide updates as they are available results in the iowa democratic caucuses were delayed monday evening creating widespread confusion among the presidential campaigns party officials said the results had been delayed because of inconsistencies in their reporting the reporting problems are believed to have only delayed the results not called them into question we found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results said mandy mcclure the party s communications director in addition to the tech systems being used to tabulate results we are also using photos of results and a paper trail to validate that all results match and ensure that we have confidence and accuracy in the numbers we report this is simply a reporting issue the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion the underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results on a conference call with the presidential campaigns iowa democratic party officials said the delay was because of the new rules requiring caucus leaders to report three sets of numbers to party headquarters rather than just the delegate totals representatives from the campaigns became angry at the party officials who hung up after being asked about when results might be known according to two people who listened to the call since the caucuses began 50 years ago iowa democrats reported only one number the delegate count from each of the state s precincts but after the razor close 2016 race in iowa between hillary clinton and mr sanders mr sanders s allies pushed the democratic national committee to require caucus states to track and report the raw numbers of how many people backed each candidate for iowa the new reporting standards meant counting how many people backed each candidate on the first and second alignment that change requiring the reporting of three separate numbers from each of the state s more than 1 600 precincts has slowed the gathering of data to a crawl additionally many precinct chairs across the state abandoned the new app that was built to help tabulate and report results as they struggled to log in they opted instead to use the telephone hotline to report i have had three precincts unable to report results said william baresel the floyd county chair one rural county chairman took to twitter to report results from a handful of precincts before calling it a night already a number of prominent democrats have questioned the role of iowa casting the first ballots in the primary process criticizing the largely white older state as unrepresentative of the diversity of their party technical issues happening in the midst of such a highly watched caucus could contribute to doubts about iowa s standing in the primary process transcript from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today the kickoff to the 2020 campaign was undercut on monday night by major delays in the reporting of the results from the iowa caucuses the story of the day it s tuesday february 4 here comes alex i ll just grab a water yeah yeah whispers that was alex burns hi hi happy caucus day happy caucus day is that a thing people say out here i don t know it s something we say out here exactly so let s just set the scene a little bit it s 4 p m we re in des moines in about 2 5 iowans are going to start heading to these caucus locations around the state we re going to do the same and i want to talk with you about how this is going to work so can you just give me a quick primer on this very particular tool of american democracy the caucus well calling it a tool of democracy is generous in the view of some people it is not a secret ballot this is not something where people take 10 minutes in the middle of their workday go vote and then return to their desk this is an in person out in the open exercise of demonstrating your public support for a candidate the way this works literally physically in practice is there are hundreds of predesignated caucus locations around the state and around 7 p m local people show up at these locations and they re asked to gather themselves into groups according to which candidate they re supporting they do that there is an assessment made about which candidate has 15 percent of the support in the room and which candidates do not hit that threshold of support so when people refer to the threshold that s what they re talking about 15 percent support at the caucus site of everybody in the room 15 percent of everybody who has showed up that s right if you haven t hit that 15 percent threshold your candidate does not qualify to get delegates and then the voting goes to a second round where you get to reallocate yourselves to candidates who did hit the 15 percent threshold so if you go in there expecting to caucus for alex burns and alex burns in the first round only has 9 percent of the people in the room supporting him highly possible entirely possible he s not super popular in iowa you can reallocate your support to somebody else in the room perhaps michael barbaro who just barely cleared the threshold at 16 5 percent so what might be the impact of this process on the field of 2020 democratic candidates and what we know about those dynamics i m thinking about bernie sanders for example who has been polling in the lead and who we understand has benefited from more moderate iowans splitting their support among the other leading candidates in the race well what the sanders campaign believes will certainly be good for him or almost certainly be good for him is having that first round popular vote ultimately released to the public they believe that however the reallocation process ultimately sorts itself out that he is very very likely to have the most support on that first round of caucusing so that even if he ends up slipping behind somebody else they will be able to brandish that as a symbolic victory which is another way of saying he predicts he might lose some support through the process as it goes along exactly and for the more moderate candidates those candidates have been competing for a lot of the same indecisive voters who are trying to sort out which of these candidates is the best bet against trump but i m not for bernie sanders right so if you are a moderate woman in the suburbs of des moines and you are tempted by three or four of these candidates you may very well have the chance to vote for one and then change your mind in the second round and it s really anyone s guess right now as to whether you are going to see more moderates moving towards joe biden on the second round or women moving towards elizabeth warren on the second round or perhaps pete buttigieg supporters scattering across the field it is wildly unpredictable and because of the way that 15 percent threshold works it is hugely important whether somebody in the first round is at 16 percent or at 14 percent not only because whether they hit the threshold for themselves but because it will determine whose supporters are actually deciding what happens on the second round and in a caucus site where elizabeth warren is at 16 percent her people are locked in in a site where she s at 14 percent that s a place where suddenly bernie sanders is in a position to pick up all the support from liberals who preferred elizabeth warren but might consider him on the second round right right but if elizabeth warren s at 16 percent bernie sanders can t go after any of her supporters because they re locked in right so if you are pete buttigieg or joe biden you are looking at the other guy and really hoping he doesn t clear 15 percent in a lot of places because you re betting that most of those voters are moderates and are likelier to go to me by a lot than they are to go to bernie but if both biden and buttigieg mostly end up at 16 or 17 percent then they could find themselves sort of persistently stuck behind bernie sanders or elizabeth warren so what should we be most on the lookout for as we head out to these caucuses a lot of voters here are not necessarily going to make up their mind based on the ideological factors that we perceive as the national media looking at these candidates from afar there can be a real sort of oversimplification for the way we see the lanes in this race that we think that somebody who is an elizabeth warren supporter is more likely to go to bernie sanders than to joe biden as i just said but it may be that somebody is an elizabeth warren supporter not because they are left populist ideologically but because they like her experience and they saw her in television ads with barack obama and they liked that so they could easily go to pete buttigieg not bernie sanders right or to joe biden or anybody else right that if you re a klobuchar voter i think we in the national media tend to think of her as a centrist candidate and by and large she is she s also the only other woman with a real shot at clearing the 15 percent threshold in this process and if you re for amy klobuchar not just because she s a centrist but because you feel like it s important to elect a woman president you might end up moving to the ideological left on a second round just because elizabeth warren is the option available to you got it so you re saying don t make assumptions i m saying that anybody who is gaming this out in advance with ideology as the sole or defining characteristic of how these voters make up their minds is really risking missing the way real people are going to experience this thank you alex thank you so we will talk to you four hours five hours hopefully four o k good luck you too here we go prepare yourself for some extremely unpleasantly cold weather o k i don t know oh actually that s reid yeah hello hi hi reid hi how are you thank you for being our chauffeur i feel like my dad s taking us all to the soccer game it s really wild what are you listening to reid i have les mis on i told you are you a big les mis guy no but this is like the last day so this is the song that last day of iowa the last day of iowa so this is the idea of the song is like one day more one day more can we crank it we can crank it hold on one day more watch them run amuck catch them as they fall never know your luck when there s a free for all we ll be ready for these school boys tomorrow we ll be far away tomorrow is the judgement day singing along tomorrow we ll discover what our god in heaven has in store one day more can you pull the lyrics up on your phone singing along one more day one day more continue on second avenue for four miles so we re pulling into johnston middle school and the parking lot is getting pretty there s a lot of cars here pretty full i d say there s a couple maybe 150 cars here we re asking you to stay right in this area here o k and then when press press right over here on the left i ll take it i ll just go over here t s over there and see if you re on the o k it s 6 o clock and the doors have just opened precinct one is on this side precinct two on this side we are now in a very crowded main hallway of the school and i think they re going to go register you re not on here either yes i am oh good thank heavens that s my husband checking ids thank you hi how are you you know each other do a lot of people know each other yeah neighbors two houses down yeah and then they head into the caucus room which is a gym which is i believe a gymnasium i m just i m having flashbacks to high school so now we re in the gymnasium there s a huge set of bleachers in the back and that is where the candidate alignment is going to begin there are signs for bernie and people are sitting on those bleachers there are signs for pete people are sitting on those bleachers warren klobuchar yang the sign in is practically done and it s 7 o clock so how about that applause whispering it s tom leffler he s the precinct chairman he s running the caucus in the vicinity testing testing whispering amy klobuchar is outside is she allowed in yeah all right amy klobuchar has just walked into the room dramatic entrance it is so great to see all of you here so my story just so you know i am from minnesota i am a granddaughter of an iron ore miner i m the daughter whispering why is klobuchar here and why is she allowed to be here any candidate who shows up can speak whispering and what s the point of her showing up at the last minute right before the caucus because this is really the time when she has to convince undecided caucus goers to come for her and more important people who their candidates might not be viable on the second alignment to get them to come to her on a realignment iowans love people to show up and she s literally shown up at the caucus yeah it s a really dramatic gesture what unites all of you in your separate groups is bigger than what divides us i would love to have your support but i also want us to win big in the general election let s do it thank you everybody thank you applause do you know what s happening right now excuse me do you know what s happening right now is now the time you vote yeah see what we re doing is i don t think we have to they told us we had a total of 358 people here to caucus registered voters we have to have 15 percent to be viable well that figures out to 54 is a count that you have to have to be viable so i was going to ask does it look like anyone s in at this moment in danger of not being viable and who isn t well the yang group is probably not going to be viable doesn t look they have 54 people over there biden it doesn t look like biden is going to be viable here so biden and yang may not make 15 percent may not make may not have 54 people right whispering are you surprised that biden doesn t seem viable at the moment very surprised are you upset well what happens happens but i think that s a mistake i can t understand the lack of support of course my wife s supporting somebody else who is your wife supporting warren o k yeah so if you don t become viable where do you think you re going to go next warren o k yeah we ll see you over there yeah whispering are you guys the yang gang whispering yes we are how are you guys doing we re from the daily with the new york times how s your vote count we re about 20 short to viability we re also looking at a very small biden crowd and hoping we can pop over there i don t know how and then maybe negotiate we re hoping that s my hope so you want to convert them to yang you think my hunch is the yang is probably more of a group of true believers versus hoping just for the most electable candidate so we ll find out the yang people are now heading over to the biden people to do some business do you want to over here we d be willing to tell you why he s a good candidate for me i really like yang i really want to see him in the government he needs to be in the government i don t see him as president quite yet he s still young he s got a lot to do but we need him in the government now and i think that i would agree cabinet member at least cabinet member or something and so he will be there let me tell you why i think joe and we would love to have joe no we re not going to go joe because he caucused when i was 24 his first election 1988 he is solid as a rock no he s not he just almost got impeached or caused our whole country to fall apart with the impeachment and his son he got his son that job for 50 000 a year that s crooked 100 percent and that s going to come up during the election if you don t think that s not going to come up when he runs against trump have you fact checked that yes i have yes have you fact checked the whole thing yes i have and about the legitimacy of it his son yes his son his son has not done anything for that money his son has not done anything for that money so this is your overture to the biden people yeah i m sorry i know it didn t work very well did it it fell flat on its face so i ll go back god these people scare me that amazes me i m so sorry about that you didn t seem swayed what you didn t seem swayed i m not swayed are you angry no i m not angry i m disappointed your face is a little red o k well yeah because i m hot but not that kind of hot did that feel like a winning argument from the yang people to you no not to me do you know where you might go biden no but are you going to go somewhere else if he s not viable if he is not viable amy would be my second choice will you try to convince your group to go to amy i don t know what i ll do i ll have to think about that i have to think about that because i but amy would be my second choice final results are being read now for the first allocation biden has 37 37 will not be viable you can come over here o k this is pete pete buttigieg has 70 viable applause viable warren has 59 viable applause klobuchar has 75 applause viable so at 8 o clock here is the count from the first round the first allocation as it s called sanders has 76 klobuchar has 75 buttigieg has 70 warren has 59 biden has 37 is not viable yang has 33 is not viable steyer has four not viable gabbard has three not viable and there are now 77 votes among the nonviable candidates that will be redistributed in the coming minutes and that could obviously given the spread between the top candidates completely change everything of course some voters may just walk out because dinner s at home getting cold or because they don t believe in any of the other candidates if you want your voice to be heard join us join team bernie i think we re going to go i m going to go with amy amy klobuchar so we have some we have some biden voters who don t have a home heading over to klobuchar what s your name if i could ask you kathleen finkenhour kathleen i can see from reading your lips that you are about to go home and not cast a vote because joe biden is not viable can you explain that decision i just he s just my candidate there are other ones that are good i don t want to go to bernie why not i just i just uh i don t he s too he s too far one way he s just too far to the left for me for me i m 82 years old so i like amy i really like her but you re not going to go there either no i m not going to go there either i m just kind of old and tired and i m going home i guess i just don t have the feeling other than i want joe and i guess i don t have the fire i used to have laughs oops a daisy have a safe trip home i don t have a sane reason for any of this oh god if i can get down without breaking my neck so it s about 8 15 and it feels like realignment has more or less finished people have switched sides switched seats switched camps and it feels like a final count is upon us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 warren has apparently added nine or 10 new caucusgoers in this latest round who were you with steyer steyler steyer yang you had another biden there biden have you counted the new ones yeah 10 the new warren votes in round two have pretty much come from everywhere they ve come from yang biden steyer and uncommitted klobuchar has picked up a lot of new votes too it looks like she might win this precinct highly possible 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 let s do it again klobuchar picking up nearly 30 votes and it looks like that s going to be enough oh wait we ve got one more sorry i was behind you wonderful what s the count 31 and 75 is 106 o k now collect them o k collecting cards o k i cheated and i looked at that spreadsheet and it looks like amy klobuchar has won this precinct o k bernie had seven more the new total for bernie is 83 warren applause warren had 10 more the new total is 69 klobuchar had 31 more the new total is 106 applause and pete had 11 more the new total is 81 so at 8 24 here are the results amy klobuchar wins this precinct just one but she wins it and sanders in second place so what we saw happen which reid predicted could happen sanders won round one by a hair and lost round two klobuchar won round two i mean the big thing was klobuchar got almost all of biden s people and so she won this precinct thank you reid so i got to run to pete s headquarters for the pete a palooza i understand that you re literally leaving us carless is that what you re saying i m leaving you carless you re going to walk back from johnston reid thank you thank you thank you it was so nice to meet you you also and have yourself a water thank you so much for your help it was really fun nice to meet you you too i wonder what happened in this other precinct are you guys from the other precinct yeah what was the result there oh pete won i guess pete won and what was the who s second third and fourth so pete won and then there was a tie between warren biden sanders klobuchar was there a big shift in the realignment a lot of people went over to amy amy wasn t viable before the realignment and then she ended up with two delegates afterwards so she doubled her people yeah that s o k buddy yeah i know you want down but you re just going to run backwards and we don t want that so well thanks again have a good night we ll be right back we re going to connect with our colleagues in new york right now it s 11 22 iowa time 12 22 new york time and we re getting the sense that we won t have the results by 6 a m when this episode needs to go up so we re figuring it out hi hi hi you re on speaker here how do you like that so we just have been so deep in the tape that we have no idea what the news actually is so what s going on so there s just a huge delay in reporting from all the precincts that for all we know could extend late into the evening or even the morning uh huh so does just nobody know what s actually happening put this into perspective for us how seismic of a shock is what has happened here at the iowa caucuses in 2020 you mean what hasn t happened the results right the outcome yes that one the thing we ve all been waiting for yes do you think we ll get results tonight or tomorrow morning tomorrow afternoon before the debate on friday it s unclear sean sebastian is joining us right now from story county he s a precinct secretary out there what can you tell us about this delay in getting any results sean well wolf i have been on hold for over an hour with the iowa democratic party the guy in the white house is chuckling all night here showing the democrats can t even get a three car funeral organized or whatever you want to call it inaudible can i help you so this is a real coincidence wolf i just got off hold just now hello so i ve got to get off the phone to report the results all right go ahead report the results hello can we listen in as you report them sean yep all right let s listen o k hi hello they hung up on me this has not been a success so alex it s 12 jesus it s 1 o clock in the morning you seem a little frustrated i m a little frustrated michael why because we have no results from the iowa caucuses we have seen sort of anecdotal data dribbling out all evening but the iowa democratic party has not posted any complete results from any of the caucuses online there s just been a massive failure of data collection and transmission and verification and so we don t really know a whole lot more about who won the iowa caucuses now than we did three or four hours ago and do you understand exactly what happened why we don t have the results where the breakdown happened we don t know in all the kinds of forensic detail that i think we probably will soon enough but what seems to have happened is that this time the iowa democratic party created an app that was intended to make it super easy for the volunteer leaders at these 1 600 plus caucuses to send in the results to a central hub and that that app did not get the job done whether that s because of user error or bad wi fi bad cell service we don t really know in full we know that the backup system was supposed to be that these precinct volunteer leaders were supposed to be able to call in the results and that then the phone lines got totally overloaded and so the state party is trying to collect and verify three different sets of data to report out exactly what happened in these caucuses and we have access to exactly none of them so how are we seeing the candidates handling this absence of information we re trying to see each of them fill this void with their own message as uncertain as that message might be at this time they have access because of their own sophisticated campaign machinery to at least some detailed data about what probably went on on monday night right their precinct captains of course have their tallies for every precinct that s right the campaigns aren t flying completely blind the way we sort of are as reporters we don t have hundreds of people around the state feeding us information like that so when you see one of the leading candidates come out and strike a certain tone in a speech or not strike a certain tone in a speech they re not completely guessing they re at least making a pretty educated guess about what kind of final results they might experience like what well the biden campaign for instance has been extraordinarily aggressive at going after the integrity of the iowa caucus process if you re a campaign that doesn t think that you re going to finish so great here and you want to put a permanent asterisk on the results and just point the attention of democrat voters later in the process this is how you d do it you heard biden in his speech to supporters sort of raise an eyebrow at what was going on with the caucuses as i think most democrats can relate to well the iowa democratic party is working to get these results get them straight and i want to make sure they re very careful in their deliberations and then point towards states where he thinks he is going to do better than he probably did here based on the information that his campaign has so it s on to new hampshire nevada south carolina well beyond we re in this for the long haul you heard a similar not quite as baleful approach from the elizabeth warren campaign because this race started right here in iowa but from tomorrow it will run from ocean to ocean she came out and gave a speech pointing to the long haul ahead of them in the democratic primary sort of an upbeat speech that she felt good about what would happen here in iowa tonight showed that our path to victory is to fight hard but it wasn t a sort of attempt to declare victory and you did hear her campaign manager roger lau go out and say that every second that the iowa results are not known it undermines the process that is notably a tone that you re not hearing from the sanders and buttigieg campaigns which among the competitors here in iowa probably feel the most optimistic about their odds of coming out on top let me begin by stating that i imagine have a strong feeling that at some point the results will be announced applause and when those results are announced i have a good feeling we re going to be doing very very well here in iowa applause so we don t know all the results but we know by the time it s all said and done iowa you have shocked the nation applause mayor buttigieg basically gave a victory speech as though the race had been called for him even though we re not nearly there yet because by all indications we are going on to new hampshire victorious applause that is a very very forward leaning posture in a situation of great uncertainty right that s known as leaning into a vacuum but it s a hell of a vacuum right now right that there s just no information for ordinary people and his campaign i think genuinely from my own conversations with them feels very good about their odds of ultimately winning or coming close in this state right and then you have senator amy klobuchar who certainly believes that she did a little bit better than anticipated we know there s delays but we know one thing we are punching above our weight applause and whose campaign manager went out on twitter and said according to their internal data she is running even or ahead of vice president biden in a lot of places again we have no way to verify on our own whether that s true at this point but it is the position that a number of the campaigns are taking i have heard it from advisers to klobuchar to warren and to buttigieg that joe biden had a weak finish that s certainly what they re hammering away at well actually at the precinct where we went in suburban des moines a town called johnston the thing that alex you had predicted would happen actually did happen sanders ended up as the front runner in the first count and then when the realignment happened the more moderate candidates ended up benefiting and that ended up working out in klobuchar s favor she won the final tally by about 20 25 votes and that might have been aided by the fact that she showed up but what do you make of that i think most of us who were following this campaign and a lot of the strategists who were active participants in this campaign believed that that dynamic would favor joe biden at the expense of amy klobuchar that if there was a moderate candidate who was persistently not quite hitting that 15 percent threshold it would be her and that her supporters would mostly go to joe biden if something like the opposite happened that could give us a really fascinating result when we actually get the numbers we re waiting for this will be thrown into much sharper relief any moment now any moment any moment do you think that tonight s kind of meltdown of this process is going to lessen the ultimate significance of the results in iowa because the usual significance we give it as the first in the nation is that it s the kickoff of the whole thing i think it s extremely likely both because of the meltdown tonight and because of just how much else is going on in the news this week between impeachment the state of the union a global pandemic the super bowl on the eve of the iowa caucuses i don t know how much the ultimate victor is going to be able to break through now that they ve been denied their own evening to spike the football as it were and i think it s possible that a candidate who gets really embarrassed here will suffer badly for it but i think the likelihood that somebody gets some enormous surge of momentum based on the results of iowa is much more questionable now than it would have been if the iowa democratic party had run this process in a more competent fashion alex thank you thank you and good morning good morning in the annals of expected news president trump won the g o p caucuses in iowa the contest was largely symbolic while democrats have saturated the iowa airwaves for over a year mr trump faced little opposition in the republican caucuses in past years republicans have canceled their caucuses when an incumbent president was running for re election still mr trump and his team have used the past week to try and grab some attention away from the democrats on thursday mr trump drew more than 7 000 fans to a rally where he predicted that iowa would deliver for him again in november he also deployed cabinet secretaries top republican officials and trump family members to the state early tuesday mr trump called the confusion on the democratic side an unmitigated disaster the only person that can claim a very big victory in iowa last night is trump he tweeted the trump campaign also questioned the legitimacy of the contest democrats are stewing in a caucus mess of their own creation with the sloppiest train wreck in history said brad parscale mr trump s campaign manager it would be natural for people to doubt the fairness of the process and these are the people who want to run our entire health care system while the caucus results remained in limbo early tuesday most of the democratic candidates boarded planes and left the state behind flying east to new hampshire to start a new round of campaigning before the feb 11 primary there pete buttigieg the former mayor of south bend ind appears to have the first event of the day a stop by riverwalk cafe in nashua at 7 a m before going on to a full day of five town hall events around the state senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts was also set to campaign in the state on tuesday morning former vice president joseph r biden jr senator amy klobuchar of minnesota and senator bernie sanders of vermont had events scheduled there through the day as well ms warren landed in manchester shortly after 4 a m surrounded by senior aides and top surrogates in brief remarks to supporters ms warren said she felt good about her campaign s position even as the official results remained unclear when i left iowa i said it is too close to call and it still is but i feel good she said we are in 31 states and have thousands of people on the ground ms warren thanked her team in iowa and said organizers would disperse to other states for what her campaign has said it expects to be a long race in previous statements her campaign manager and chief strategist said they believed that ms warren had finished in a closely bunched top three in iowa with mr buttigieg and mr sanders nature may abhor a vacuum but candidates abhor it more and so in the absence of any official results from the iowa caucuses they all tried to frame the vacuum in the best possible light ms klobuchar said she knew one thing we are punching above our weight mr sanders joked about the delay and said he had a good feeling that when the results finally arrived we re going to be doing very very well mr biden said he was going to leave iowa with his share of delegates ms warren of massachusetts said it was too close to call but assured her supporters that they were one step closer to beating president trump then there was mr buttigieg who decided the vacuum didn t exist what a night he yelled to a mass of cheering supporters late monday declaring with zero percent of precincts officially reporting that by all indications we are going on to new hampshire victorious because tonight an improbable hope became an undeniable reality in truth that reality was very much deniable a buttigieg aide said that his campaign had received results from 77 percent of its precinct captains and that those results showed him in position to win the most state delegates but this was hardly conclusive jeff weaver a senior adviser to the sanders campaign said he had similar numbers from mr sanders s precinct captains showing him ahead and even if the internal results are accurate results can vary hugely from precinct to precinct so there is no way to say that 77 percent of the precincts accurately reflect the whole so we don t know all the results mr buttigieg said but we know by the time it s all said and done iowa you have shocked the nation christopher c krebs the director of the homeland security department s cybersecurity agency said late monday evening that the mobile app being used in the caucuses had not been vetted or evaluated by the agency cybersecurity experts also said that the app had not been properly tested at scale and that it was hastily put together over the past two months iowa democratic party officials only decided to use the app to report results after a previous party proposal which entailed having caucus participants call in their votes over the phone was scrapped on the advice of democratic national committee officials j alex halderman a professor of computer science at the university of michigan and david jefferson a computer scientist at lawrence livermore national laboratory said monday night that they had warned state officials that the mobile reporting app was vulnerable to what is known as a denial of service attack in which hackers flood the central servers used to power the app with traffic stalling them or knocking them offline this app has never been used in any real election or tested at a statewide scale and it s only been contemplated for use for two months now said mr jefferson who also serves on the board of verified voting a nonpartisan election integrity organization this is an embarrassment but it shouldn t shake people s confidence in the results mr halderman said if this had been an election conducted by phone or online that would have been a major disaster we might never know the results and would have had to re run the entire contest this is an urgent reminder mr halderman said of why online voting is not ready for prime time mr jefferson warned that nevada is also currently slated to use a similar mobile app to report its caucus results in a few weeks ms warren said the early returns in iowa showed an appetite for her campaign of big structural change even as official results were muddled by technical difficulties in a rare set of prepared remarks after being introduced by her grandchildren ms warren repeated a new refrain this campaign is for you it was in keeping with her attempts to paint herself as the candidate best suited to unite the democrats moderate and progressive wings she acknowledged that the race s official results were still muddled it is too close to call but i m just going to tell you what i do know she said as the baby daughter of a janitor i m so glad to be on this stage tonight she then gave the sort of positive speech often given by victorious candidates this race started here in iowa but from tomorrow it will run ocean to ocean east to new hampshire and then west to nevada then down to south carolina she said this fight will stretch across all 57 states and territories that make up this great nation until we unite together as a party in milwaukee the road won t be easy but we are built for the long haul on a frustrating night for every candidate all of whom were hoping to declare victory quickly and then jet off to new hampshire mr sanders tried a bit of humor let me begin by stating that i imagine i have a strong feeling that at some point the results will be announced mr sanders told supporters at his election night watch party and when those results are announced i have a good feeling we re going to be doing very very well here in iowa the biden campaign sent a letter to the iowa democratic party late monday night citing considerable flaws in the reporting system for the caucuses and seeking information from the party before results are made public the integrity of the process is critical and there were flaws in the reporting systems tonight that should raise serious concerns for voters kate bedingfield a deputy campaign manager for mr biden said on twitter addressing supporters mr biden said he wanted to make sure the state party was very careful in their deliberations and added that he expected the results to be close we re going to walk out of here with our share of delegates he said we don t know exactly what it is yet but we feel good about where we are in the letter the biden campaign s general counsel dana remus wrote that the app to relay results from the caucuses had failed and that the backup telephone reporting system had not work either these acute failures are occurring statewide ms remus wrote ms remus said that campaigns should get more information from the state party as well as a chance to respond before official results are made public we believe that the campaigns deserve full explanations and relevant information regarding the methods of quality control you are employing and an opportunity to respond before any official results are released she wrote there may have been no official confirmation of how anyone was doing ms klobuchar told supporters monday evening but she knew she was doing well we know there s delays ms klobuchar said speaking at the des moines marriott but we know one thing we are punching above our weight even in a crowded field of candidates even during the well earned impeachment hearing of donald j trump which had me bolted to my senate desk for the last two weeks we kept fighting and you kept fighting for me she said somehow some way i m going to get on a plane tonight to new hampshire and we are bringing this to new hampshire i gotta say i m a numbers guy and we re still waiting on numbers from tonight the former tech entrepreneur andrew yang said in a speech to supporters in des moines we re all looking around being like what s the math but the math that i care most about is the fact that this movement has become something that has already shocked the political world he added and it s going to keep on going from here it s going to keep on growing from here there s one candidate saying that whatever happens in iowa tonight does not matter all that much mr bloomberg the former new york mayor spent monday flying through california stopping in sacramento fresno and compton he shook hands with voters took a few questions from reporters and plans to get on a plane to michigan tonight mr bloomberg is waging an extremely unconventional campaign skipping the first four early states entirely and instead focusing on super tuesday and beyond i m a believer that if you want to fight the last war you believe things like whoever wins iowa goes all the way mr bloomberg said in an interview at a community center in compton on monday you believe that only six states matter that was the last election that s not true today early voting officially began monday in california and mr bloomberg is urging supporters to cast a ballot for him now though mr bloomberg mostly demurred from playing pundit he stands to gain if the moderates stumble in iowa reporting
