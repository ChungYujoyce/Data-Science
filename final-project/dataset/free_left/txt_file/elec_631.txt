advertisement supported by after overseeing the dispersal of hundreds of hasidic mourners in brooklyn mayor bill de blasio called the gathering absolutely unacceptable by liam stack mayor bill de blasio lashed out at hasidic residents of the williamsburg section in brooklyn late tuesday night after personally overseeing the dispersal of a crowd of hundreds of mourners who had gathered for the funeral of a rabbi who died of the coronavirus in a series of posts on twitter mr de blasio denounced the gathering which the police broke up and warned the jewish community and all communities that any violation of the social distancing guidelines in place to stop the spread of the virus could lead to a summons or an arrest something absolutely unacceptable happened in williamsburg tonite a large funeral gathering in the middle of this pandemic the mayor said in one post when i heard i went there myself to ensure the crowd was dispersed and what i saw will not be tolerated so long as we are fighting the coronavirus the authorities have dispersed several well attended religious gatherings since restrictions on such events were enacted in the face of the outbreak the events that were broken up included weddings and funerals in new york neighborhoods with large jewish populations but the episode on tuesday which according to yeshiva world involved the funeral of rabbi chaim mertz appeared to be the first time the mayor had directly participated in a dispersal my message to the jewish community and all communities is this simple the time for warnings has passed mr de blasio said in another post i have instructed the nypd to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups this is about stopping this disease and saving lives period jewish groups and leaders reacted to the mayor s warning with outrage chaim deutsch a city council member who represents a section of brooklyn with a large orthodox jewish population expressed anger and disbelief on twitter writing this has to be a joke but singling out one community is ridiculous he added in another post every neighborhood has people who are being non compliant to speak to an entire ethnic group as though we are all flagrantly violating precautions is offensive it s stereotyping and it s inviting antisemitism i m truly stunned jonathan greenblatt the head of the anti defamation league said the mayor s remarks were unfair to the more than one million jewish people who live in new york city the few who don t social distance should be called out but generalizing against the whole population is outrageous especially when so many are scapegoating jews he wrote on twitter this erodes the very unity our city needs now more than ever other people noted the size of the crowds that had gathered earlier in the day across the region to watch a military flyover by pilots from the navy s blue angels and the air force s thunderbirds honoring essential workers the orthodox jewish public affairs council said in a post on twitter that people failed to social distance at a funeral the same day that thousands of new yorkers failed to distance for 45 minutes to watch a flyover on wednesday mr de blasio defended his remarks at a news conference and said he spoke last night out of passion i spoke out of real distress that people s lives were in danger before my eyes and i was not going to tolerate it he told reporters i regret if the way i said it in any way gave people a feeling of being treated the wrong way that was not my intention it was said with love but it was tough love it was anger and frustration but he rejected the suggestion that his comments unfairly singled out members of the jewish community or reflected a double standard in enforcing social distancing rules it has not happened other places let s be honest he said this kind of gathering has happened in only a few places and it cannot continue it s endangering the lives of people in the community i understand politicians every one has said oh look you know this is like people gathering in the park he added no it s not like people gathering in the park it was thousands of people can we just have an honest conversation here it was not acceptable a spokesman for rabbi mertz s synagogue kahal tolath yakov said in a statement that it came up with a plan to have many streets closed so that people participate and walk the coffin while following the social distancing rules and wearing masks unfortunately this didn t pan out and nypd had to disperse the crowds the spokesman jacob mertz wrote we shall note that everyone followed the police officers orders and the vast majority had masks yet the confusion and chaos led to scenes of large crowds the pandemic has hit hasidic residents of new york with devastating force sickening and killing people at a rate that local leaders and public health data suggest may exceed that of other ethnic and religious groups hundreds of hasidic people have died of the virus community leaders said including influential religious figures like the rabbi yaakov perlow who led the novominsker hasidic dynasty and agudath israel of america an umbrella ultra orthodox organization most of the orthodox jewish leaders who have died amid the pandemic have not had big crowds at their funerals but some have been mourned at large public gatherings like the one on tuesday in williamsburg the persistence of such events has drawn wide news media coverage it has also generated deep unease among hasidic groups who feel they are being singled out for opprobrium and worry about anti semitism and in any case they argue public health violations in their neighborhoods endanger them most of all updated may 27 2020 common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity

world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities dermot f shea the new york city police commissioner said on wednesday that the department learned of rabbi mertz s funeral on tuesday and made plans to monitor it videos posted on social media showed that members of the neighborhood hasidic safety patrol known as shomrim were there as well mr shea said the department had thought it was unlikely a large crowd would gather for the funeral as time unfolded last night there were probably several thousand people that came in and around that location he added additional officers were called in and in pretty short time that crowd was dispersed mr shea said 12 summonses were issued for failure to disperse and he criticized events such as the one on tuesday for putting members of my department at risk and said they would be met with stern consequences gatherings of any size have been banned in new york state for more than a month as part of the sweeping orders enacted by gov andrew m cuomo to slow the spread of the coronavirus the police department has assigned hundreds of officers to enforce social distancing rules responding to calls of overcrowding at stores parks and other gathering spaces officers have made 11 arrests and issued 134 summonses to people accused of violating emergency rules according to the department s daily enforcement reports almost half of the summonses issued and two of the arrests made stemmed from a birthday party at a barbershop attended by nearly 60 people in brooklyn the police also broke up a speakeasy in brooklyn and a marijuana party in manhattan mr mertz from kahal tolath yakov said in a statement that the rabbi s death had left the community in a period of mourning and devastated by the loss of this highly revered spiritual leader may the almighty help that this plague should end very soon he wrote and no one shall endure any more losses to this terrible pandemic and we shall all stay safe and healthy
