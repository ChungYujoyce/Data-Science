advertisement supported by three years ago president trump swiftly fired his first national security adviser michael t flynn for lying to the f b i ahead of the november election mr trump and his allies are now telling a very different tale by adam goldman and mark mazzetti washington after announcing that the justice department was dropping the criminal case against michael t flynn the former national security adviser attorney general william p barr was presented with a crucial question was mr flynn guilty of lying to the f b i about the nature of phone calls he had with the russian ambassador to the united states after all mr flynn had twice pleaded guilty to lying about them well you know people sometimes plead to things that turn out not to be crimes mr barr said last week in an interview with cbs news then he went even further and described the infamous calls during the trump presidential transition as laudable mr trump and his allies now accuse the f b i of framing mr flynn which is part of the president s broader campaign to tarnish the russia investigation and settle scores against perceived enemies ahead of the november election there was more whipsawing in the case this week as a federal judge appointed a hard charging former prosecutor and judge to oppose the justice department s plan to drop the charges against mr flynn to a large degree this extraordinary turn of events has overshadowed the stark changes in the trump administration s story line on mr flynn from three years ago mr flynn top white house officials said then had lied to vice president mike pence and other aides about the nature of his calls to the ambassador had lied repeatedly to f b i agents about the calls and might have made himself vulnerable to russian blackmail revisiting the chaotic weeks surrounding mr flynn s ouster based on recently disclosed government documents public statements court records and interviews show how much the original trump administration concerns about him have been buried under the president s cause of portraying the russia investigation as a witch hunt mr barr for example has recently argued that the f b i interview of mr flynn was not justified because agents who had been investigating him had not found any wrongdoing and were on the verge of closing the case when agents found out about the call with the russian ambassador sergey i kislyak they concocted a reason to keep the case open for the express purpose of trying to catch lay a perjury trap for general flynn mr barr said in the cbs interview a broad array of legal experts disagree this case reeks of political influence said marshall l miller a former top prosecutor in brooklyn and the principal deputy of the justice department s criminal division mr flynn admitted twice under oath that he lied to the f b i political appointees at d o j are now trying to rewrite the law to erase the crime transcript from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today federal prosecutors are asking a court to throw out their own criminal case against former national security adviser michael flynn mark mazzetti on what led to that decision it s thursday may 14 mark remind us where the michael flynn story starts well michael flynn was a three star army general who had a quite distinguished career became the head of the defense intelligence agency under the obama administration and then he gradually sort of moves into the trump orbit in 2016 when trump was running for president during the republican convention we do not need a reckless president who believes she is above the law he famously leads a chant lock her up yes that s right lock her up of lock her up meaning to hillary clinton right if i did a tenth of what she did i would be in jail today and after trump is elected he announces that he s going to make flynn his national security adviser so it s during this time when there s a series of events that get michael flynn into trouble it s shortly after christmas in 2016 when the obama administration announces a number of sanctions against russia for its efforts to sabotage the 2016 campaign it was soon after that the washington post reports that trump s incoming national security adviser michael flynn repeatedly called the russian ambassador to the u s that the washington post reported that flynn had been on a number of phone calls with the russian ambassador on the exact same day on the same day the obama sanctions were announced which raised questions about whether the incoming trump administration was trying to meddle with the obama administration s foreign policy i talked to general flynn about that conversation actually it was vice president elect mike pence goes on face the nation they did not discuss anything having to do with the united states decision to impose a censure against russia pence says that flynn had told him the sanctions never came up on the call but the justice department had transcripts of the calls in which flynn had actually urged the ambassador not to overreact to the obama administration s sanctions f b i agents interviewed michael flynn about whether he discussed u s sanctions with russian so f b i agents are sent to the white house to interview flynn what has he told investigators he tells them that the sanctions never came up on the call right he s lying to the f b i right this all becomes public and in february 2017 general michael flynn suddenly resigned late last night flynn is forced to resign he is the shortest serving national security adviser now in modern history and what happens to flynn once he s pushed out of the white house the f b i continues to investigate flynn but very little is heard from him for a number of months and during this time president trump starts leaning on james comey the f b i director in essence to drop the flynn investigation right and that raised this idea that the president of the united states was trying to obstruct justice and that s this kind of cataclysmic moment that ultimately sets off a chain of events that leads to not only comey being fired but also the appointment of mueller as the special counsel right in many ways the flynn saga is the beginning of the mueller saga and the beginning of a very dark chapter for the trump administration that s correct what ends up happening to michael flynn well flynn pled guilty to repeatedly lying to the f b i flynn ends up pleading guilty to lying to the f b i says that he is cooperating becomes a cooperating witness in the mueller investigation he s awaiting sentence court documents make clear that flynn was not acting alone and the significance was that he was the first top white house official to plead guilty as part of the mueller investigation court papers say flynn could get up to six months behind bars but he was under mark i feel like for many people that is where the michael flynn story pretty much ends right i mean you have this three star general national security adviser who just totally falls from grace after lying to his bosses and the f b i and now he s headed to prison that s right and the mueller investigation marches on and the next significant point is the end of 2018 into 2019 when flynn is set to be sentenced by a federal judge and the mueller team weighs in breaking news right now bob mueller s office is recommending to the judge that michael flynn actually not receive any prison time and says flynn s been a good witness michael flynn cooperated plenty with the special counsel they recommend very little if any jail time the defendant provided firsthand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and russian government officials and something curious happens then where flynn s legal team which had been very cooperative towards the mueller investigation clearly they cut what seemed to be a pretty good deal with the mueller team decide to take a more combative stance they enter into the public record this idea that maybe flynn had been railroaded that the f b i may have set him up so this angers the judge he really reads flynn and his team the riot act saying are you now saying you re not remorseful and why are you now accusing the f b i of misconduct and basically says let s take a pause we re going to put this off for a few months and come back to me when you ve found some remorse in the intervening time the ground starts to shift william barr has just been sworn in as the new attorney general gaining broad control of the special counsel robert mueller s russia investigation william barr takes over as attorney general i believe it is vitally important that the special counsel be allowed to complete his investigation he during his confirmation hearing pledges that he s not going to interfere with the mueller investigation so mueller famously then delivers his report to barr in march of 2019 the deputy attorney general and i concluded that the evidence developed by the special counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense and barr writes a very short summary of sorts that he says summarizes mueller s findings which we now know misinterprets the mueller report it s quite clear starting at that point that barr has great issues with not only the mueller investigation but how this all began how the russia investigation began at the f b i and whether there was real misconduct i ve been trying to get answers to questions and i found that a lot of the answers have been inadequate and i also so he makes no secret of the fact that he s going to start investigating the investigation he is going to launch a campaign to get to the bottom of what happened and whether there really was a political effort to go after donald j trump and his advisers and what does that mean for michael flynn awaiting sentencing for lying to the f b i as the ground shifts and as it s clear that barr is going to look at the predicate for the entire investigation flynn decides to get a new lawyer nothing about this case was done right they violated every rule every protocol who is not only a lawyer but also a pundit of sorts the entire prosecution was false it must be dismissed this is a texas lawyer named sidney powell who has made no secret of the fact that she thinks the entire thing is a witch hunt their prosecution of general flynn was needed to keep the obstruction hoax going against the president because they already knew the russia hoax had fallen apart very much in line with what the president of the united states has said so the whole thing was orchestrated and set up within the f b i and days before she takes over as flynn s lawyer she writes a secret letter to attorney general barr where she writes quote it is increasingly apparent that general flynn was targeted and taken out of the trump administration for concocted and political purposes wow so you re saying flynn recognizes the winds are changing recognizing that there s literally a new sheriff attorney general in town who s skeptical of the entire russia investigation and so flynn hires a lawyer who fits quite nicely into that dynamic yes and during that period of time attorney general barr decides to appoint another prosecutor who s going to examine the case and see whether there had been any misconduct that had taken place so just to be clear in addition to examining the roots of the russia investigation broadly barr appoints a specific prosecutor inside the department of justice just to examine the flynn case that s right and that leads to the release of a number of documents to the public in recent weeks that have led both flynn s lawyers and the president to make the case that michael flynn was indeed railroaded and set up by the f b i we ll be right back mark tell us what s inside these documents in essence the documents are internal f b i and justice department communications around the time that flynn was interviewed by the f b i and what they show kind of broadly are that there was concern about the decision to interview flynn one of the documents that got a lot of attention was written by bill priestap who at the time was the head of the f b i s counterintelligence division which was running the whole russia investigation and this is january 24 four days after the trump administration takes over and right before there is this decision to go send f b i agents to interview the national security adviser and priestap writes quote what s our goal truth admission or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired wow in another document he seems to understand the risks of conducting this interview and he says protect our institution by not playing games and if we are seen playing games the white house will be furious some of that language is quite potentially inflammatory the idea that the person running the investigation is wondering if their goal might be to get the national security adviser fired essentially to get him in trouble it raises this question of whether sidney powell flynn s lawyers had a point that they were trying to set him up right and finally there s also interesting divide that is revealed between the f b i and the justice department and what some of the documents show is that there was some concern of justice department about what the f b i was up to so there s some concern about whether or not interviewing flynn is at all a good idea right and we find out that the f b i only tells the justice department they re going to go do this while the agents are on their way to the white house huh mark what happens once these internal f b i documents are released what s the reaction this unleashes a torrent of criticism he should dismiss the case for egregious government misconduct without a doubt by flynn s lawyer sidney powell that the government has been hiding this evidence that shows their own crimes while they were accusing mr flynn falsely of any crimes because they made it all up by other commentators on the right a lot of people close to this feel like michael flynn was setup never lied admitting that they got things completely wrong and actively worked to defame instead it looks like two systems of justice in terms of how the f b i handled hillary clinton and how they handled donald trump by president trump when i looked at what they did to him they tormented him dirty cops tormented general flynn making the case that flynn should never have been interviewed and the case should now be dropped and what would be the legal basis for that argument what in the documents do flynn s lawyers seize on and say makes his prosecution illegitimate well they re saying that these documents reveal that there was real concern in the f b i about whether the interview should have taken place in the first place mm hmm and if the interview doesn t take place then there s no lies to worry about and if there s no lies then there s nothing to prosecute flynn on and therefore there is no case period and michael flynn should walk free you have no predicate to be there in the beginning then whatever you find is immaterial to the investigation and this is what barr seizes on when he makes this incredibly dramatic decision last week just in this afternoon the justice department is dropping its criminal case against president trump s former national security adviser retired general michael flynn to drop the charges against michael flynn the justice department today is holding that there was not a legitimate basis to do an investigation of flynn barr said there was never any good reason to interview michael flynn in the first place and so whatever flynn said during the interview was irrelevant and barr even goes further than that attorney general barr thank you for speaking first to cbs news hi catherine in an interview last week he not only criticizes the decisions that were made at the time to interview flynn there was not in our view a legitimate investigation but he also goes to bat for flynn going all the way back to flynn s phone calls with the russian ambassador and it is very typical and very common for the national security team of the incoming president to communicate with foreign leaders and that call there was nothing wrong with it whatever in fact it was laudable and it was nothing inconsistent with the obama administration s policies and it was in u s interest he was saying to the russians don t escalate he actually says that the phone calls were laudable and that it was perfectly understandable that flynn would talk to the russian ambassador to try to lower tensions in a very tense environment when history looks back on this decision how do you think it will be written well history is written by the winners so it largely depends on who s writing the history i mean what s fascinating about what barr is doing is that it does not feel like every day when the department of justice sides with a defendant in a criminal prosecution over its own prosecutors who have successfully gone after that defendant and it s in keeping with what william barr has done for a year from the time that robert mueller presented his report to barr barr has questioned the legitimacy of the investigation and any fruits of that investigation he has questioned whether those prosecuted were done so fairly or whether the f b i overreached he has also backed decisions to lower sentences of others mark is barr s legal analysis in the flynn case sound is it in dispute barr s decision has been widely criticized plenty of legal experts say that prosecutors in general have wide discretion to decide which aspects of the investigation they want to pursue what is germane to the case and in this specific instance the fact that there was an ongoing investigation into contact between trump aides and the russians would make flynn s calls germane to this particular investigation that is not to say that now looking back there haven t been instances of f b i abuse over the course of the russia investigation mark given everything you ve just said and reading these documents that have been released from the department of justice about the debate that went on inside the f b i these notes from an agent about how to conduct this interview whether they might basically trap flynn in a lie and get him fired i mean is there a version of this where what bill barr has done is exactly what any justice system should do when there are serious questions about the legitimacy of a prosecution which is kind of give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant you always want greater transparency when it comes to how an investigation was conducted that s true if the target is michael flynn or if the target is someone far less famous the concern of course is whether there is abuse going on in the other direction what do you mean that what the attorney general is doing is in effect launching a campaign to discredit the investigation to discredit the mueller probe to discredit its results in a way that will ultimately benefit his boss president trump remember president trump who s been railing against the quote unquote witch hunt for years will be using this for his re election campaign so the concern of course is that bill barr is kind of acting as a proxy warrior for the president but mark is it possible that both things can be true that the attorney general bill barr may be trying to discredit the entire russia investigation and in the process very much oversimplify things and that the prosecution of michael flynn might be flawed yes both of those things can be true and this is why the passions are so intense on this issue because both sides want to control the narrative and because of that can t allow necessarily any gray area in this argument either michael flynn is a hero or he s a traitor either the mueller investigation was a just pursuit or it was a witch hunt and of course there is a lot of space between those characterizations and nuance that gets lost because the political debate is black and white so mark what s going to happen to michael flynn now well of course given what william barr decided there is a very likely scenario that michael flynn soon is a free man and he is brought back into the fold and in the coming months we see him once again campaigning for donald trump thank you mark thanks michael on wednesday night the times reported that before the department of justice sought to throw out the case against michael flynn it had interviewed the f b i official whose notes have been interpreted as potentially seeking to entrap flynn in that interview the official bill priestap said that his notes had been misconstrued and that there was no effort to set flynn up we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today the scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent significantly worse than any recession since world war ii we are seeing a severe decline in economic activity in a speech on wednesday the chairman of the federal reserve warned that the pandemic could permanently damage the american economy if congress does not act to prevent a wave of bankruptcies and prolonged unemployment long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up and leave families in greater debt the message from jerome powell suggested that the trillions of dollars that congress has already pumped into the economy may not be enough additional fiscal support could be costly but worth it if it helps avoid long term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery and the house of representatives is poised to temporarily change its rules to allow lawmakers to vote and hold committee hearings remotely so that they can avoid traveling to washington during the pandemic the rules expected to pass tomorrow would mark a major change for a body long defined by the tradition of meeting and voting in person that s it for the daily i m michael barbaro see you tomorrow mr flynn s troubles began with a phone call it was dec 29 2016 the day the outgoing obama administration announced sanctions against russia for the country s widespread effort to disrupt the 2016 presidential election mr flynn who was mr trump s incoming national security adviser urged mr kislyak in a phone call not to escalate tensions with a retaliatory move against the united states perhaps by kicking american diplomats and spies out of russia given the circumstances the call was remarkable the united states government had just determined that its longtime adversary had launched a concerted effort to sabotage a presidential election and the incoming national security adviser was having a back channel discussion with a top russian official that might lead to the new trump administration gutting the sanctions its predecessor put in place to punish the russians mr flynn chose not to document the calls with the ambassador a decision that records from the investigation of the special counsel robert s mueller iii show was based on his concern that he might be interfering with the obama administration s foreign policy weeks before mr trump took office his concerns were well founded when president vladimir v putin of russia did not retaliate after the obama administration s sanctions president barack obama was perplexed and asked spy agencies to figure out why the f b i unearthed the discussions between mr flynn and mr kislyak when reviewing transcripts of the ambassador s intercepted calls f b i officials discussed interviewing mr flynn whom agents had been investigating as part of the bureau s inquiry into whether any trump campaign associates had conspired with russia during the presidential election the matter took on greater urgency when mr flynn s discussions with mr kislyak were revealed publicly by david ignatius a washington post columnist top trump transition officials including mr pence as well as reince priebus who was to be white house chief of staff and sean spicer the incoming white house press secretary questioned mr flynn about the washington post column mr flynn denied that he spoke about sanctions with mr kislyak and mr spicer repeated those claims to members of the news media days later on jan 15 2017 mr pence was asked about the column during an interview on the cbs news program face the nation the incoming vice president said that he had talked with mr flynn about his calls with mr kislyak and he said that mr flynn was unequivocal they did not discuss anything having to do with the united states decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against russia the vice president said mr pence s interview set off alarms at the f b i and the justice department if mr flynn had lied to the vice president the russians knew that and could use it as leverage over mr flynn newly disclosed documents made public in mr flynn s criminal case show officials were also concerned that mr pence might have been lying as well the implications of that were that the russians believed one of two things either that the vice president was in on it with flynn or that flynn was clearly willing to lie to the vice president mary b mccord a former top national security at the time said in an interview with the special counsel s office the f b i decided to try to find out who was lying to whom james b comey the bureau s director at the time sent a pair of agents to the white house to speak with mr flynn who by then was only a few days into his job as national security adviser but mr comey made the unusual decision to not notify senior justice department officials about the interview until the agents were already on their way to the white house blindsiding and infuriating the officials who oversee the f b i about a highly sensitive session during the interview mr flynn was asked about sanctions and other topics he denied talking about russian sanctions according to documents even as agents used his own words from the highly classified transcripts to refresh his memory mr flynn seemed relaxed agents would note and did not betray any signs of deception but the f b i reports from the interview did not square with the transcripts of the phone calls and soon trump administration lawyers were discussing whether mr flynn might have committed a felony by making false statements during the interrogation mr priebus later recounted to mr mueller s investigators a meeting with mr trump in which he told the president about the concerns that mr flynn had lied during his f b i interview mr trump was angry mr priebus recalled and said not again this guy this stuff within days white house lawyers including the white house counsel donald f mcgahn ii had concluded after reviewing the transcripts of the calls that mr flynn had repeatedly lied about his discussions with mr kislyak according to the findings by the special counsel mcgahn and priebus concluded that flynn could not have forgotten the details of the discussions of sanctions and had instead been lying about what he discussed with kislyak mr mcgahn and mr priebus decided that mr flynn needed to go and made that recommendation to mr trump on feb 13 after mr priebus told mr flynn that he must resign he brought him into the oval office there mr flynn and the president hugged and mr trump said he would give mr flynn a good recommendation you re a good guy the president said according to the account mr priebus gave to the mueller team we ll take care of you ten months later after mr flynn had pleaded guilty for lying to the f b i agents and agreed to cooperate with the mueller investigation mr pence said that removing him from the white house was the right move what i can tell you is that i knew that he lied to me the vice president told cbs news and i know the president made the right decision with regard to him mr pence no longer holds that view and his change over time reflects the far more combative position among trump administration officials toward the various investigations into mr trump and his advisers as this shift was occurring mr flynn jettisoned the legal team that had advised him to cut a deal with the mueller prosecutors and hired a new lawyer sidney powell who launched a frontal attack on the forces that she believed led her client into wrongfully admitting to a felony offense in a letter to mr barr last june days before officially becoming mr flynn s lawyer ms powell wrote that it is increasingly apparent that general flynn was targeted and taken out of the trump administration for concocted and political purposes the letter was disclosed last year by federal prosecutors in the flynn case after mr barr announced his decision last week to drop criminal charges in the flynn case top trump administration officials including those who three years ago believed most vehemently that he should be fired said that he would be welcomed back at the white house i think general michael flynn is an american patriot he served this country with great distinction mr pence said last week in an interview with axios on hbo and for my part i d be happy to see michael flynn again advertisement
