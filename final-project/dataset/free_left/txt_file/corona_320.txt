friday despite a slight increase in number of hospitalizations and number of patients on ventilators louisiana is in a better place today than we were at this time last week gov john bel edwards said friday it is because of you he said it is because of the people of louisiana and your compliance with the stay at home order louisiana has over 19 000 people diagnosed with covid 19 the state has lost

released data showed that while african americans make up roughly 32 of louisiana s population they account for 70 of the deaths in the state we want to make sure that we have better health outcomes on the other side of this pandemic as well the governor said so we need to answer the question what are the social determinants of health disparity and how do we ensure health equity for all of our citizens and thistask forcewill be meeting this charge edwards said his state has received additional federal funding for continuing testing sites in the state some of which were scheduled to close as soon as today edwards said he still isn t satisfied with the testing within the state and that is another issue the task force will tackle there is no region of our state that isn t currently testing but we don t believe that we have adequate testing anywhere he said dr deborah birx the response coordinator for the white house coronavirus task force cautioned friday we have not reached the peak you can see for the first time that in the united states we re starting to level on the logarithmic phase like italy did about a week ago birx said at the white house briefing this gives us great

surgeon generaldr jerome adams said the government is taking steps now to combat the alarming trend the government is working on data collection targeted outreach and increasing financial employment education housing social and health support so everyone has an equal chance to be healthy adams said at friday s briefing in new york the state hit hardest by the pandemic gov andrew cuomo is cautiously optimistic we are slowing the infection rate the three day average hospitalization rate is down and for the first time new york has registered a negative number of icu admissions cuomo said at his friday press briefing there were 17 fewer people in intensive care units statewide than there were previously cuomo said in new york state over 160 000 people have been diagnosed with covid 19 that s more than any other state in the u s and country in the world over 7 000 people in the state have died the death toll is going up and i understand the logic to that cuomo told good morning america anchor michael strahan friday these are people who came into the hospital a couple of weeks ago they didn t recover they were put on ventilators and once you re on a ventilator the longer you re on a ventilator the worse it gets as preliminary data showed the largest percentage of coronavirus deaths in new york city was among hispanics the governor on wednesday called for more testing in minority communities hispanics accounted for 34 of covid 19 deaths though they make up 29 of the population twenty eight percent of those who have died from covid 19 in nyc have been african american are we shocked that the rates are higher in the african american latino community we shouldn t be michael if we re being honest cuomo told gma we know that there s inequality in the health care system we know that the poorer communities often pay the highest price for these types of emergency situations because they re really just bringing to light that systemic racism and discrimination in the system let s learn from this moment cuomo said it s testing and understanding why the minority community has a higher rate is it because they work in public sector jobs and they were essential workers and they didn t have the luxury michael of staying home and they didn t have the luxury of going to stay at their second house or staying with a relative in their home in the suburbs there has to be
