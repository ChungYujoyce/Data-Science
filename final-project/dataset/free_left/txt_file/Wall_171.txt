advertisement supported by blaming the city for coronavirus is a way of letting the federal government off the hook by kim phillips fein ms phillips fein is a history professor at new york university the anxious notes have been arriving in my inbox from people all over the country watching reports and wanted to check in i know why they are concerned new york city has emerged as the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the united states for those of us in the city even if we are staying in our apartments almost all day pressing elevator buttons with our elbows or gloved hands when returning from a once a week journey to the grocery store we are well aware that we are living at the heart of the storm almost as alarming as the health data though is the suggestion circulating in some political corners that new york and new yorkers are to blame for spreading for the coronavirus as though the city helped to create a health threat now endangering the good people of the south and midwest once it was the chinese virus now it also belongs to new york as president trump put it in his short lived bid to quarantine new york new jersey and connecticut some people would like to see new york quarantined because it s a hot spot the implication being that if new yorkers could only be kept where they are with checkpoints and guards if need be covid 19 could be stopped from spreading elsewhere in the country gov ron desantis of florida set up checkpoints to stop cars with new york or louisiana license plates so that state troopers can warn drivers to self quarantine or face 60 days in jail even as he hesitated to put any social distancing in place or close the beaches for spring break instead of admitting the danger of community spread in florida the governor framed the problem as one of outsiders bringing germs in governors in maryland and other states warned anyone arriving from the new york city area to isolate themselves on twitter covid 19 has taken on a new sobriquet the cuomovirus there s a long history of scapegoating new york city for problems that have their roots far beyond the hudson in the 1970s the ford administration blamed new york s liberal politics generous social safety net and strong public sector unions for the fiscal crisis that almost brought the city to bankruptcy even though that crisis arose when the country as a whole was mired in recession at a moment when federal policies encouraged suburban flight and the departure of factories from cities like new york despite the national context for the city s difficulties president gerald ford warned that there could be no federal aid for the country s largest metropolis because it had brought its problems on itself as his press secretary ron nessen put it this is not a natural disaster or an act of god it is a self inflicted act by the people who have been running new york for a long time underlying ford s punitive attitude was a deeper conservative critique of the city its history of leftist politics its tuition free city university and its network of public hospitals several of which were closed in the fiscal crisis all made new york suspect as did its reputation as a center for the gay rights movement and feminism the vision of new york as morally suspect a city of sexual promiscuity and libertine mores also helped shape the federal response to the aids epidemic of the 1980s the reagan administration failed so dismally in addressing the health crisis not even mentioning it publicly for years after it had emerged as it raged in part because aids was viewed as a disease of the cities especially of gay men and iv drug users not as a problem of the heartland but while some aspects of new york s situation in the 1970s and beyond were unique the larger problems the city faced were those confronting the entire country and the aids epidemic too spread throughout the nation blaming new york was a way to let the federal government off the hook today the scapegoating of the city could have consequences even more profound than during the 1970s it could mean the city not getting the federal money it needs or a sufficient supply of ventilators and masks and enough support for health care workers what is more the suggestion that new york is uniquely susceptible can support the dangerous illusion that allowed the coronavirus to gain traction here in the first place that we are able to cordon ourselves off from one another that one region of the country or the world can be separated from the rest acting on this fantasy would be the real danger to states like florida vermont and tennessee at the same time painting a picture of the entire city as equally at risk may make it harder to address the likelihood that the coronavirus will probably have the most devastating impact on working class and poor people who are less likely to have good access to health care whose underlying health may be worse to begin with and for whom the economic penalties of social distancing are more profound the dense urban spaces of new york city are empty now the libraries and public schools closed the playgrounds and streets notably quiet but the social solidarity that they nurture still has the capacity to offer lessons that might help the rest of the country i ve seen this even in my own apartment building where people have mobilized in support of the most at risk residents all from a distance of six feet high school students are offering virtual tutoring to homebound elementary school kids younger tenants are picking up groceries for elderly people for whom a trip to the store might be more dangerous the most organized among us are keeping phone lists so that tenants can call one another if any of us get sick and need help and as is happening in places around the world every night at 7 people come to the windows and the balconies of my apartment complex to cheer for the heroism and dedication of the city s health care workers the e m t s ambulance drivers physician assistants janitors cooks orderlies doctors and nurses as we chant and clap we can see one another from the windows and across the courtyard and even in this moment of devastation the collective life of our city offers sustenance and hope may that mutual support be felt across our country and beyond kim phillips fein a historian at new york university is the
