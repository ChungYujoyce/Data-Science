the tragicomedy that is the republican presidential race took an interesting turn over the weekend ben carson is now leading donald trump and republican field in the latest cbs new york times poll carson takes26 percent of the vote while trump earned 22 percent although carson s lead is within the margin of error this is a significant shift in longstanding trends trump has been the leader for several months now but carson appears to have broken through with key demographics particularly evangelicals the cbs report sums up carson s advantages well carson has made gains across many key republican groups in a reversal from earlier this month he now ahead of trump among women and is running neck and neck with him among men carson s support among evangelicals has risen and he now leads trump by more than 20 points with this group carson performs well among conservative republicans and those who identify as tea partiers it s not terribly surprising that carson leads trump among women and evangelicals trump is the misogynist par excellence and carson is a proud religious fanatic these are natural demographics for carson but carson s rising support among men and tea partiers relative to trump is somewhat surprising tea partiers don t do policy their project is essentially negative which is why the gop s nihilism and obstructionism began in earnest when tea partiers were elected to congress in 2010 neither carson nor trump have anything resembling a platform or a plan they re outsiders with no political experience who want to disrupt the status quo that s a message that resonates with conservative men and tea partiers if there s a difference it s that trump is louder and more aggressively obnoxious than carson which ought to endear him to these demographics evidently though carson s unhinged nice guy routine is working his new campaign ad perfectly illustrates both his appeal and his vacuousness in a 30 second tv spot carson manages to hit all the right conservative notes without coming close to explaining what he s going to do i m ben carson and i m running for president he says the political class and their pundit buddies say impossible he s too outside the box well they do know impossible impossible to balance the budget impossible to get border security impossible to put aside partisanship i m ben carson i m running for president and i m very much outside the box if you re waiting for the part where he says how he s going to balance the budget or get border security or put aside partisanship you don t know ben carson or the new gop carson is basically doing the same thing as trump bashing the political class and promising to fix everything that s broken only carson does so with a lukewarm smile whereas trump pounds his fist on the table with tri statebravado it doesn t matter that neither candidate has a discernible plan to accomplish any of these things the empty rhetoric is more than enough for republican voters one of the more interesting findings in the new cbs nyt poll is that 55 percent of trump backers say their support is firm while 80 percent of carson supporters say they could change their minds this is good news for trump it suggests carson is far more of a flavor of the month candidate than trump whatever the reason trump has real staying power he s proven that carson however remains a question mark he may well win in iowa thanks to his support among evangelicals but the gop s last two iowa winners santorum and huckabee lost the nomination trump moreover is well positioned in the other early primary states like new hampshire and south carolina where he remains comfortably ahead of carson carson s boost in the polls will be a boon to his campaign but his long term viability is still debatable if this trend continues for another month or two however trump might be in real trouble sean illing is a usaf veteran who previously taught philosophy and politics at loyola and lsu he is currently salon s politics writer follow him on facebook and twitter read his blog here email at silling salon com copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
