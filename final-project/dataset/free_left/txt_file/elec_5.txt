 2016 how gop establishment in wisconsin will do anything to stop trump in next key primary by katie glueck 03 31 2016 05 18 am edt ted cruz campaigns at the altoona family restaurant on march 28 2016 in altoona wis ap photo wisconsin s republican establishment is publicly lining up behind ted cruz privately it s killing many of them to do it a substantial slice of wisconsin republican party veterans and business leaders can t stand cruz s combative style in the senate abhor his hard line on immigration could do without his heavy religious rhetoric and have misgivings about his general election prospects but they re willing to swallow all of that to back their best hope of beating donald trump though some can t help but pine for paul ryan or someone like him coming out of a contested convention advertisement cruz may not be their first choice but he may be their only choice said brandon scholz a longtime gop operative who runs a governmental and public affairs shop in madison others who have not been on the cruz ship are at least at this point buying into wisconsin is the firewall to stop trump a prominent wisconsin republican business leader who required anonymity in order to speak freely added that he expects that the business community will turn out next tuesday and a narrow hold your nose vote for cruz majority will prevail among those republicans there will be a stop trump vote but i do not think it reflects enthusiasm for cruz this person said it s going to be an unenthusiastic vote it s a pick your poison vote that does not have the business community fired up they re basically asking what color suicide vest do you wear by steven shepard it s a far cry for the enthusiasm many in the state show for ryan who as well as being a native son matches cruz s fiscal conservatism with a less combative approach to governing a deep focus on empowerment for impoverished communities and an emphasis on expanding the party it s a vision and certainly a tone more in keeping with marco rubio than with cruz and it s one that many in the party seem to be struggling to fully let go of with our style here the sort of inclusive aspirational style of conservatism paul ryan would represent the big question in my mind was what would happen when rubio dropped out would rubio backers be willing to make the switch to cruz who quite frankly is not a natural fit here said charlie sykes a prominent conservative radio host and a leader in the stop trump movement in wisconsin i don t think people know cruz very well here i think the evangelical style might have been a little harder edged than we re used to sykes said despite that awkward fit between the hard line conservative texas senator and a wisconsin gop that has prioritized unity the establishment has united for him and against trump in a way that it hasn t in other states leading wisconsin republican voices from sykes himself to wisconsin gov scott walker are backing cruz with varying degrees of enthusiasm walker said tuesday that he is proud to back the texas senator both assembly majority leader jim steineke and assembly speaker robin vos who like many others in the state establishment were backing rubio after walker dropped out of the race are now supporting cruz it appears to be yielding results cruz surged to a 10 point lead over a stagnant trump ahead of next week s primary according to the marquette law school poll the state s most reliable pollster for some of cruz s newfound supporters however it remains a marriage of expediency and it hasn t stopped establishment eyes from wandering some are gaming out a scenario in which cruz wins wisconsin and goes on to keep trump under the needed number of delegates to become the nominee paving the way potentially for someone else to emerge from a brokered convention by kyle cheney in the weeks before he made his endorsement even walker floated the possibility of another candidate emerging as the nominee from an open convention saying if it s an open convention it s very likely it would be someone who s not currently running former congressman scott klug a cruz critic who is supporting ohio gov john kasich says that pining for ryan the home state congressman and house speaker is widespread very consciously a lot of people are hoping it s paul klug said adding that he personally thinks a brokered convention respect for ryan aside would be absolute chaos ryan himself has said repeatedly that he does not want the nomination and wants someone who ran for president this year to be the nominee he has also said that this no is different from the ones he initially offered about becoming house speaker calling it a totally different situation still ryan s fans are hoping they can coax him to the top of the party ticket the way they once did to the top of the house ryan also as mitt romney s 2012 running mate has experience on the presidential campaign trial and many in wisconsin and beyond see him as a future president but barring a stunning last minute change from ryan for center right wisconsin republicans for now the choice is cruz many lining up behind cruz buy his campaign s principal line about why he should get their support trump must be stopped and cruz with his deep organization in wisconsin and nationally his well funded campaign and his reliably conservative record is the only one with a shot at doing it the endorsement from right wisconsin the website associated with sykes acknowledged that cruz was not a first or even second choice but it called him the candidate best positioned to take on trump if you look at the political establishment in southeastern wisconsin it very heavily leans cruz from the talk show hosts all the way to a lot of state leadership klug said the whole southeast wisconsin infrastructure is tilting cruz to freeze out trump sykes said that when vos the assembly speaker who i really did not expect to come around came on board it indicated this is a binary choice suggesting that if wisconsin is going to be a firewall you had to support cruz you had to at least tactically decide for cruz you can feel the dominoes falling in that respect in the last four days that cruz is now the choice of wisconsin s establishment is a remarkable development given that the texas senator made his name running as a fiercely anti establishment insurgent who routinely clashes with party leadership in washington and whose views particularly on immigration have only grown more conservative throughout the primary campaign to the dismay of chamber of commerce types who want a more big tent approach but in wisconsin home to walker and to ryan who are both considered quite conservative the entire gop has moved right over the past 10 years walker who during his failed presidential bid was considered too conservative by more centrist donors and party leaders aligned with other candidates elsewhere in the country is the establishment here by katie glueck walker s statewide approval rating has plummeted since his presidential bid but scholz said he still holds significant sway over republicans in the state it is very much his party and his endorsement is likely to sway some fence sitters if they re in the establishment they are sitting there going i m not certain what i m going to do i think the governor s endorsement speaks a lot means a lot he said and while trump s policy positions have been all over the ideological map cruz s policy views also square fairly well with party leadership said mark graul another longtime gop operative in the state cruz has got a lot to offer center right conservatives he said probably on eight out of 10 issues center right voters agree with ted cruz that s not the case with donald trump nationally those reservations along with concerns over cruz s hard line views have caused some moderate donors and party leaders to decide to stay out of the primary altogether and focus on house and senate races instead other prominent establishment voices including jeb bush and mitt romney have spoken out in support of cruz but on tuesday wisconsin is expected to have the largest primary turnout since 1980 and many establishment oriented republicans have an interest in the state supreme court elections also held that day adding motivation for voters already afraid of trump winning the nomination that center right turnout for ted cruz however will be grudging we don t need to continue to agitate and polarize we need somebody who can try and build some consensus said another wisconsin republican business leader who does not like cruz or trump and is holding out hope for ryan but on tuesday the republican said i ll vote for cruz missing out on the
