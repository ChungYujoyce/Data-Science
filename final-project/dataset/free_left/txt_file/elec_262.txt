 2016 the task of tracking and counting delegates in a contested convention is going to require a once in a generation feat of political and technological engineering by darren samuelsohn 03 24 2016 05 26 am edt attendees check their cellphones on the final day of the 2012 republican national convention in florida getty the race is on for the gop convention killer app the political equivalent of a moonshot that will enable the rival presidential campaigns to navigate what s expected to be a chaotic july convention tracking counting and potentially swaying the cleveland convention s 2 472 delegates amid a maze of confusing rules is a mission critical function in a nominating process that figures to be contested which is why the campaigns have already embarked on a once in a generation feat of political and technological engineering advertisement the goal isn t necessarily an app but rather some combination of technology designed for the first contested national convention in 40 years while campaigns for statewide office have used delegate tracking data technology in state party conventions and even at recent national party conventions nothing on the scale of what would be required for the summer of 2016 has ever been attempted running one statewide convention is a massive undertaking says chris lacivita a former senior adviser to rand paul during his 2016 presidential run who has run campaigns for several contested statewide conventions running 50 plus simultaneously is gargantuan it s herculean it s massive donald trump s plan includes arming his whip team and campaign surrogates with new custom built hardware so they can keep in constant touch during what could be multiple rounds of balloting barry bennett a trump convention strategist said the campaign doesn t yet have a budget for its tech strategy and also insisted there is no need to create a unique iphone app or even rely on a more generic digital platform instead trump staff would use a closed loop system to ensure maximum speed communicating on the convention floor without having to worry about the potential for shaky internet service in what will no doubt be an overloaded quicken loans arena what you need is a communications platform that is independent of bandwidth in the room so congestion isn t a problem bennett said every trump delegate could have one so we could constantly be gathering info from them by kristen east as for ted cruz behind in the delegate count but still plodding away as if he can win the nomination outright the texas senator is building his own convention technology modeled off the same data driven strategy he s been using to micro target key demographics in the early primary and caucus states whatever tech approach the campaigns take the focus first centers around gathering intelligence on all of the gop delegates headed to cleveland many of whom are still being elected throughout the spring at local and state conventions and other executive meetings here the key for cruz is deciphering which delegates are bound to other candidates and which ones we can persuade chris wilson head of the cruz research and analytics shop said in an interview as it builds up that data the cruz campaign will develop software over a six to eight week period later this spring that its convention whip team can use to go to work on the floor in case of internet malfunctions the cruz system is going to be built so it s capable of running both online and offline in cleveland unlike trump s the cruz effort won t involve building new hardware it s tough to improve the iphone wilson said likening the convention tech project to work the campaign has done around other big attendance events where there was a very specific audience in mind that could be reached with a tailored online message both to grow its network and raise money among those events wilson cited forums hosted during the past year by the national rifle association republican mega donor sheldon adelson and the conservative political action conference as we move into the convention we ll take that same sort of approach said wilson who is leaning on saul anuzis to spearhead the cruz campaign convention technology planning effort john kasich spokesman rob nichols declined to address any convention plans but responded via email when we win the white house and draft our how we did it memoir we ll devote a chapter to all that deep background inside strategic launch code info and i ll advance it to you before we send to the publisher by kenneth p vogel throughout the 2016 cycle the leading republican white house hopefuls have leaned on expensive data driven operations to help volunteers knock on the right doors and spread carefully calibrated messages on television online and through direct mail so it makes sense that the next beachhead in the push for tech supremacy would be at a contested convention gop technology and convention experts say the remaining campaigns could see this effort grow even more elaborate in the coming weeks if the delegate race stays close and where the ultimate ticket out of cleveland is a trip to the general election against the democrats it s a big what if exercise said lacivita but campaigns planning for the big what if would be the best prepared to deal with it should it arrive the technology options are really limitless for the campaigns it s just a matter of how much time and money they want to spend for different bells and whistles at the same time they also need to be sure that anything they construct can actually be used during the convention both to stay in compliance with internal party rules that won t be codified until a week or so before the event and also just in terms of technical capacity given the outsized communications demands that all the candidates plus thousands more delegates spectators and media will be placing on cleveland s internet infrastructure on one end of the spectrum for convention technology is what one gop operative called a ford pinto version of delegate tracking that boils down to some basic spreadsheets and calculations defining the loyalty levels of all the convention voters combined with the ability to share real time updates outlining when during the balloting process each person would be free to support someone other than their state s primary or caucus winner a cash rich campaign could also build the cadillac model that has all manner of fancy upgrades some of the tools described sound more apt for the macy s marketing department or the nsa but they include facial recognition software to help quickly identify lesser known delegates and a mobile tracking system so key campaign staffers could know the whereabouts of delegates as they travel from the convention floor out into the city center s hotels restaurants and bars using data and the latest in technology to track delegates at political conventions actually isn t a new thing in 2012 mitt romney s presidential campaign had a data file available of all its delegates to backstop against a potential uprising by ron paul supporters something that ultimately wasn t needed on the tampa convention floor other efforts have been on a much smaller scale at the state party level interestingly many of the tech tools used in those down ballot races were developed by some of the same tech minded strategists who have been key inside players in the 2016 presidential race optics by m scott mahaskey wilson the cruz strategist helped create delegate tracking data and technology that utah gop senate candidate mike lee used during his state s 2010 convention when he knocked out incumbent sen bob bennett the work that wilson and his firm did was actually seen as so effective that sen orrin hatch hired them to avoid the same kind of tea party backlash at his own 2012 state convention of course technology alone isn t going to be enough for trump or cruz or even a dark horse third candidate like kasich to prevail if there s an open convention in cleveland several gop convention strategists insisted that human intelligence and old school communication methods will be needed too everything from two way radios to hand signals and perhaps even the kinds of seemingly random coded signs seen on the sidelines of college football games also potent many gop aides say will be the personal relationships that republican campaign operatives have built across the country over many past election cycles after all what the candidates at this late stage of the nomination fight will be trying to do is to get the delegates to make them tell you something they want to keep to themselves said benjamin ginsberg the former republican national committee general counsel and attorney for the romney and george w bush presidential campaigns there isn t a computer program in the world that can substitute for being in the political trenches with someone added lacivita i m not trying to poo poo high technology but if you spend all your time developing and war gaming and playing dungeons and dragons with the newest high tech whiz bang toy you re going to lose the advantage and time the convention facilities themselves also could put limits on just how effective any campaign technology is the rnc is already working with technology and telecommunication firms to try to get enough web capacity for everyone coming to cleveland we will have more bandwidth and infrastructure than ever before convention spokeswoman kirsten kukowski said but that s also easier said than done just ask anyone who has ever tried to post a picture on facebook at a crowded baseball game or concert well aware of the bandwidth issues republican digital strategists say it ll be a tough decision on what to budget for new pieces of software that could be rendered useless if the convention center gets overloaded at pivotal moments or if staffers got assigned to a windowless war room with concrete walls where they re challenged in sending messages to their floor whip staff gop digital operatives also said they were concerned about any new gop convention rules that won t be firmed up until a week before the july event that could prohibit them from even using any new innovations for example they warned against limits on the number of ipads allowed on the floor or perhaps even on a specific piece of technology itself like facial recognition or mobile tracking several campaign experts said they don t think the candidates need to go overboard with their convention tech requests the first thing they need is a spreadsheet and a calculator lacivita said by alex isenstadt another source maintained that what s necessary is a tracking system akin to what s used for working big dollar donors a fluid script that changes based on a person s specific interests the most important thing will be solid data on the delegates as well as information on alternates who step in if there s an absence estimates for a killer convention app appear to range from five to six figures and the incentive to spend money on the technology is seen by many as well worth it if it can potentially put someone in the white house said one gop tech expert anyone who goes to convention will be able to fund raise enough money off a couple weeks worth of emails to pay for it whether you re donald trump or john kasich limping in with 150 delegates kyle cheney contributed to this report missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your
