goers narrowly beating out joe biden s 20 a difference within the poll s 4 point margin of error rounding out the top five are bernie sanders 11 pete buttigieg 9 and kamala harris 6 all other candidates were under 5 warren has seen a 7 point increase in support since june the only candidate within the top five to see her support jump biden is down 3 points sanders fell by 5 buttigieg dropped by 6 and harris support remained even warren saw an even bigger jump in her overall support with 71 of respondents saying she was their first choice second choice or that they were actively considering supporting her that was a 10 point jump from june the biggest from any candidate in the race trailing her are biden with 60 a 1 point drop from june buttigieg and harris with 55 a 3 point increase for both and sanders at 50 a 6 point drop warren s steady rise in iowa comes after she invested early in the state building out an experienced team on the ground before many other campaigns hired a large staff the silver lining for biden 26 of those who say the former vice president is their first choice say they ve made up their minds and won t caucus for someone else that s true of only 12 who say warren is their first choice the poll in fact found there could be significant shifts in the months to come as only 20 of likely democratic caucus goers said their mind is made up for who they plan to support a clear majority of respondents 63 say they could be persuaded to support a different candidate warren had the highest favorably rating in the poll with 75 saying they found her very or mostly favorable and while the poll is something of a mixed bag for buttigieg his overall favorability rating jumped 8 points to 69 the biggest increase among the candidates polling in the top five that could be a promising sign for the south bend mayor who had one of the strongest showings of support at the polk county democrats steak fry in des moines on saturday buttigieg a strong fundraiser has recently invested heavily in iowa he has nearly 100 staffers and more than 20 offices open around the state i m not too worried about a variation like that buttigieg said about his drop in the poll s first choice portion i think the important thing is do people know you do they know what you re about and do they like what they see and you seem to be seeing a lot of encouragement on that front biden s favorability rating has dropped 6 points since june and 16 points since last december before he entered the race his favorability rating now sits at 66 sanders is down 12 points since june and 16 points since december and is now at 58 favorability harris favorability meanwhile remained at 63 the california senator just wrapped up her first swing to iowa since august and her campaign bet big on iowa this week by vowing to have a third place or better finish in the state one aspect of warren s rise comes from her support among groups that had previously tended to support sanders she now leads sanders 27 to 22 in voters under the age of 35 and leads sanders 48 to 20 among voters who identified as very liberal harris takes a compassionate turn via campaign reporter lacrai mitchell in her first visit to south carolina in nearly three months kamala harris addressed hundreds at the 102nd annual naacp freedom fund dinner in charleston on saturday delivering what one surrogate called the most compassionate articulation of her criminal justice record harris described coming home after graduating from howard university and receiving perplexed looks from members of her community when she said she wanted to be a prosecutor she also acknowledged she still receives those looks today because of the role that prosecutors have sometimes played in the criminal justice system let s be honest prosecutors haven t always been or often been part of the solutions we need and through the history of our legal system they ve too often presented barriers to justice and an engine for over incarceration and they sure didn t look like me said harris i said then what i say today we need soldiers in every phase layer and trench of the movement for social justice we must also do the hard yes long and frustrating work of driving change from the inside as well harris will complete this swing through the state by attending the celebration of life service for the late dr

themselves this was evident during the debates in houston where some of the candidates were asked if they would pull troops out of afghanistan without negotiating with the taliban more often than not their answers dealt with future conflicts more than current concerns but while the democratic field may see no political advantage in proposing new solutions to ongoing foreign policy headaches it s
