he referred to mexicans as rapists questioned sen john mccain s status as a war hero ridiculed the physical appearance of his opponents falsely claimed that thousands in new jersey cheered as the world trade center fell and this week called for a ban on muslims entering the united states despite predictions that such searing divisive rhetoric and the resulting outcry would cripple his campaign donald trump s insults and controversial proposals have propelled him to the forefront of the 2016 presidential race and kept him there and while it may seem like a lurching chaotic campaign trump is for the most part a disciplined and methodical candidate according to a washington post review of the businessman s speeches interviews and thousands of tweets and retweets over the past six months trump delivers scores of promises diatribes and insults at breakneck speed he attacks a regular cast of villains including undocumented immigrants muslims democratic front runner hillary clinton his gop rivals and the media he keeps the narrative arc of each controversy alive with an endless stream of statements an unwillingness to back down even when he has misstated the facts and a string of attacks against those who criticize him all the while his supporters see a truth talking problem solver unlike the traditional politicians who have let them down spending remarkably little he dominates yet another news cycle and his republican rivals languish in his shadow on any given day the reality tv star s attacks are delivered from a variety of stages whether it is broadcast interviews or his stream of trumpness monologues at rallies during one hour long speech in november in alabama trump logged nearly four dozen barbs in a rant in which he described president obama as representing us very poorly very very poorly horribly actually secretary of state john f kerry as a loser and the american dream as dead trump uses his instagram account which has more than 650 000 followers to deliver snarky messages and short videos of him scowling as he delivers pronouncements from his trump tower desk on twitter trump s 5 million followers can keep up with his next appearance will be on abc news tonight at 6 30 pm and new poll numbers just won iowa cnn poll big trump has posted more than 6 000 tweets since launching his campaign in june no one is off limits not even a new york times reporter with a disability and no one is too small as louisiana gov bobby jindal r learned when trump dismissed his struggling campaign in three tweets the last of which read oh wow lightweight governor bobbyjindal who is registered at less than 1 percent in the polls just mocked my hair so original choker weak and clown are the words trump repeats to brand gop rivals such as sen marco rubio fla and former florida governor jeb bush as well as critics such as republican consultant karl rove more recently trump has questioned whether clinton has the strength or the stamina to be president while boasting that he needs only four hours of sleep every night the post s analysis found several qualities to trump s approach first is a pattern of experimentation that suggests that he is testing his insults and attacks as he goes along like a team of corporate marketers trump understands the value of message testing but he appears to do it spontaneously behind the lectern and on live television after 74 year old sen bernie sanders of vermont who is seeking the democratic nomination underwent outpatient surgery for a hernia trump tried joking about it at a rally in georgia on nov 30 trump said the condition was caused by carrying around too much tax problems the response from the audience was tepid trump tried again at a rally two nights later in virginia he was carrying around the tax code he wants to make larger it still didn t get many laughs and trump stopped trying another quality to trump s words is the kernel of truth that often exists in even his most inflammatory statements he told supporters that obama would allow 200 000 or 250 000 syrian refugees into the country describing the level as insane in fact the administration has agreed to admit only 10 000 trump has refused to backtrack once explaining that his larger number comes from a pretty good source these patterns of speaking along with his charm and sometimes lavish praise for people he likes resonate with many conservative voters who are looking for someone to trust over the mainstream media they see trump as genuine and honest one of the few politicians who don t lie to them even if his comments are not fully true with each new uproar the analysis also showed a largely predictable cycle unfolds it begins with trump s bombast next comes condemnation and predictions that his candidacy is doomed followed by his tendency to keep going without backing down the pattern has repeated with many of his major controversies trump often provokes a fresh whiplash inducing controversy that eclipses the current one triggering a new round of free media coverage that cements his place at the forefront of the news cycle on nov 18 he drew attention and criticism for appearing to mock an overweight protester at his rally the next day he found himself enmeshed in a new controversy over whether to track muslims with a database at other moments trump repeats his inaccuracies with escalating zeal even as they are debunked by experts at the rally in alabama he said he watched on sept 11 2001 as thousands and thousands of people in jersey city were cheering as the world trade center came tumbling down politicians and law enforcement officials dismissed his claim for a full week trump refused to back down he presented the opinion of his own supporters as evidence that he was correct his persistence drew him even more attention i saw it at the time i stick by it he told meet the press moderator chuck todd who challenged his account in late november and i m getting unbelievable response of people that said they saw it three days later a new national poll showed trump holding a 10 point lead over his nearest republican rival the pattern of trump s deliveries even as he is widely vilified has been on display since he announced his candidacy in june at trump tower on manhattan s fifth avenue they re bringing drugs they re bringing crime they re rapists he said referring to undocumented mexican immigrants a legion of democrats and republicans denounced him including several of his gop opponents univision canceled its agreement to broadcast trump s miss universe pageant and macy s stopped selling his line of clothing and fragrances in response trump tweeted that druggies drug dealers rapists and killers are coming across the southern border when will the u s get smart and stop this travesty he used twitter to declare that macy s stores suck he pounded republican opponents who criticized him including bush and former texas governor rick perry saying that both were weak on border security mocking perry trump wrote he needs a new pair of glasses to see the crimes committed by illegal immigrants at the same time two dramatic events occurred that emboldened trump s anti immigrant rhetoric providing the element of truth his supporters could cite in championing his candidacy in san francisco an undocumented immigrant shot and killed kathryn steinle 32 who became beautiful kate in trump s demand for a wall separating mexico and the united states days later the drug kingpin known as el chapo escaped from a mexican prison prompting trump to tweet that the united states would invite the felon to become a u s citizen because our leaders can t say no his campaign was barely a month old pundits and columnists predicted his demise but trump would not relent instead he found a new target mccain in iowa on july 18 trump began a news cycle as he had many others with an outrageous attack that critics said would kill his campaign it didn t first he questioned whether the senator from arizona who was a prisoner of war in vietnam deserved his war hero status he is a war hero because he was captured trump said i like people that weren t captured okay next trump denied that he had questioned mccain s heroism then he shifted the crux of his criticism instead of mccain s military service trump questioned the senator s record on veterans issues undeterred by the torrent of criticism he faced from washington s political establishment military groups and his republican opponents in addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our vets john mccain let us down by losing to barack obama trump tweeted among more than a dozen tweets and retweets he sent in the ensuing days once again pundits pondered trump s survival but pollsters found that his support was only growing for all his apparent ad libbing trump s presentation is rife with words he often repeats he tells supporters that the wall he wants to build on the southern border would be the greatest the purported mastermind who terrorized paris was a moron in a filthy dirty hat he is no more predictable than when he disparages his republican opponents using his outsize platform to define them in highly personal and unflattering terms while he likes to describe himself as a counterpuncher ever ready to strike once he is attacked trump often lashes out at rivals who threaten him in the polls in early november gop rival ben carson s popularity in iowa was rising prompting trump to repeatedly mock and promote doubts about the accuracy of the surgeon s autobiography how stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap trump asked one audience soon carson s poll numbers sank a development that trump made sure to point out to his audiences from july through october trump sent more than 50 tweets and retweets about bush describing him as weak really weak pathetic and totally lost on television and at his rallies trump branded bush as low energy a characterization he repeated in an ad in which the narrator says jeb for all your sleeping needs as rubio rose in the polls during the fall he found himself the target of trump s tweets and retweets nearly two dozen times a litany that included descriptions of the senator as a lightweight after the carnage in paris and through the rampage in san bernardino calif three weeks later trump shifted his attention to terrorism a focus that culminated with his proposal this week to ban muslims from the united states as outrage about his remarks mounted tuesday and his name dominated another news cycle trump again showed no signs of retreat wow what a day he tweeted that night so many foolish people that refuse to acknowledge the tremendous danger and uncertainty of certain people coming into u s jose delreal and amber phillips contributed to this report jose delreal and amber phillips contributed to this report
