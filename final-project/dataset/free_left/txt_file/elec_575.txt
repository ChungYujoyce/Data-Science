advertisement supported by by maggie haberman and michael barbaro in what passes for normal inside donald j trump s unorthodox campaign for president he flew from arkansas to iowa on his trump emblazoned jet on friday arrived the next morning at a candidate forum without any prepared remarks and wearing a bright red tie that evoked his days on the apprentice told the world exactly what he thought about senator john mccain s reputation as a war hero it was an improvised fit of pique roundly and vigorously denounced by his rivals all weekend that exposed the biggest vulnerability of mr trump s campaign for president it is built entirely around the instincts and grievances of its unpredictable candidate anddoes not rely on a conventional political operationthat protects presidential hopefuls from themselves in a reaction that highlighted the problem mr trump refused on sunday to apologize for declaring that mr mccain is not a war hero because he was captured and instead boasted in an interview that his talk in iowa had aroused the biggest standing ovation of the day the remarks about mr mccain the 2008 republican presidential nominee ended any qualms party officials had about criticizing mr trump for fear of alienating his supporters and might normally have led to days of backpedaling and extended explanations even as mr trump insisted that no one was troubled by his comments his small group of aides emailed one another about how to respond to the growing criticism but the word sorry is not in mr trump s lexicon and apologizing was not an option that was discussed people privy to the internal debate said in a sign of the seat of the pants nature of his campaign it sent out a series of dissonant messages some trying to tamp down the controversy by showing support from veterans and others going on the attack especially of the media it remains to be seen whether mr trump s standing in public opinion surveys will suffer from the episode with mr mccain but recent national and early primary state polls put mr trump in the top tier of candidates if nothing else the weekend reaffirmed that mr trump is running a presidential campaign on his own unique terms transcript na never mind that his top rivals for the republican nomination treat campaigning like a full time job for mr trump the task of seeking the white house occupies half his time he estimated in an interview it s probably 50 50 he said the rest of the republican field s top tier has cast a wide net to find experienced political aides but mr trump has plucked much of his team from inside his own corporate empire the r sum of his iowa co chairwoman she was a contestant on the apprentice while his competitors may be busy working through thick stacks of books on world affairs to prove their qualifications mr trump says he has little use for such one of the problems with foreign policy he explained is that it changes on a daily basis as a busy man he added he prefers newspapers there is no real policy shop churning out position papers or for that matter a well staffed central headquarters plotting his long term message or speechwriters drafting or modulating his words and there is a circular interoffice quality to what the campaign does with its money but the dangers of mr trump s approach are now being laid bare bare bones improvisation which seemed sufficient to fuel his ascent in the polls is starting to backfire mr trump faces a moment of real reckoning is the man known for the catchphrase you re fired willing to soften his caustic language will he slog through the grueling rituals of a long campaign and above all will his message keep resonating or will his own outlandishness undermine his candidacy turning it into his latest exercise in brand building so far tellingly he is continuing to criticize mr mccain and has shown little interest in building a conventional campaign i m not trying to arm the country he said in a lengthy interview last week emphasizing that he does have staffs in the first three states in the nominating process iowa new hampshire and south carolina mr trump a real estate developer and reality television star has declared himself a candidate for the republican nomination for president here is a look at what he will need to do if he hopes to win the reality is that mr trump is pulling off something that for now requires little planning spending or organization he is giving voice to a profound rage in the republican electorate over economic displacement illegal immigration and america s diminished place in the world i have a pulse to the ground he added i think i know what s wrong with the country and i think i ve been able to portray that in a way that people agree with unlike in the past when he mused about the presidency mr trump is putting a team on the ground as well he has hired at least four workers in new hampshire for example and has visited iowa nearly a dozen times he hired a campaign manager corey lewandowski a new hampshire resident who previously worked for americans for prosperity a political action committee financed by the conservative billionaire koch brothers over all he has spent 1 4 million on his campaign most of it out of his own pocket and less than half of what jeb bush and senator marco rubio have spent exasperated aides who said they were tired of making the case to skeptical reporters that mr trump was really running called those moves evidence enough that a legitimate campaign was taking shape nobody s asking jeb bush if he s serious about running mr lewandowski said last week adding that his candidate s place in recent polling spoke for itself i don t know what to do i don t know which metric you want to measure it by the unorthodox tenor of mr trump s campaign may flow from its unusual origins he has of course flirted with running for office before as early as 2000 as an independent presidential candidate he did not do it and then 2011 when he talked about mounting a bid for the white house again he did not in 2013 he floated the idea of running for governor of new york he decided not to this time he declared a candidacy and despite questions about his sincerity his commitment seemed to grow as his business deals became imperiled by the remarks he made about mexican immigrants during his announcement speech last month in that speech an hourlong riff delivered without a teleprompter he said mexico sent the united states criminals and rapists donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention those close to him said he was surprised that in the uproar that followed nbc severed ties with him ending his long run on the apprentice the show that made him a television star not just a developer soon macy s the p g a and a prominent chef who was developing a restaurant inside a new trump hotel in washington followed suit without his hit show as an option mr trump has little left to lose by staying in the race and conducting an increasingly provocative campaign in fact he may have something to reclaim a brand that firmly identifies with the working americans who are flocking to his events hank sheinkopf a longtime political operative who has watched mr trump for decades said that every time a business cancels a contract with mr trump his supporters view him as the victim of entrenched powerful institutions that do not have the interests of regular people in mind in any case mr sheinkopf said mr trump will benefit even if he never makes it to election day by appealing to working class white voters and potential consumers of his corporate brand who feel dispossessed by contemporary politics his real business is giving out his name as a franchise he added his business is being donald trump but his staying power in the campaign remains highly uncertain he has never committed to remaining in the race even through its first contest the iowa caucuses early next year although he has left open the option of running a third party race and his many businesses still beckon last week in keeping with his 50 50 time commitment to running for president he took a break from the campaign to attend a ribbon cutting at a trump owned winery in charlottesville va those looking for mr trump s views on policy were treated to a sales pitch for what he called the largest winery on the east coast more important than the size mr trump told the crowd we make the finest wines in an interview on sunday mr trump showed no sign of changing his style he checked off the names of those attacking him over his remarks about mr mccain insulting gov bobby jindal of louisiana and former gov rick perry of texas in the process jindal who has nothing he said rick perry i mean rick perry give me a break here advertisement
