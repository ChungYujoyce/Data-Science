 first read is a morning briefing from meet the press and the nbc political unit on the day s most important political stories and why they matter why the cruz kasich alliance could backfire on paper the alliance between ted cruz and john kasich whereby kasich will skip the may 3 indiana primary to help cruz against frontrunner donald trump while cruz will skip oregon may 17 and new mexico june 7 to help kasich makes a lot of sense after all when you add up the cruz kasich percentages in recent polls that number beats trump s percentage the alliance is also necessary given that the three public polls out of indiana now show trump ahead and if trump wins the hoosier state it s game over for cruz and kasich but we can count three reasons why last night s announced alliance truce could end up backfiring one it plays right into trump s argument that republican forces are conspiring against him and that the contest is rigged indeed he released this statement last night when two candidates who have no path to victory get together to stop a candidate who is expanding the party by millions of voters all of whom will drop out if i am not in the race it is yet another example of everything that is wrong in washington and our political system this horrible act of desperation from two campaigns who have totally failed makes me even more determined for the good of the republican party and our country to prevail all kasich supporters in indiana aren t going to vote for cruz two it s not a sure thing that all of kasich s voters in indiana will support cruz according to a fox poll released over the weekend which showed trump leading cruz in the hoosier state by eight points 41 33 53 of kasich voters said cruz would be their second choice while 22 said it would be trump so without kasich in the equation the indiana contest becomes much closer but it doesn t guarantee a win for cruz what s more kasich is still on the ballot and he hasn t instructed his supporters in indiana to vote for cruz instead he just said he won t actively campaign in the state and indiana voters have been voting absentee since april 5 which means some kasich supporters have already voted for the ohio governor in fact that same fox poll conducted april 18 21 found that 4 of indiana republicans had already voted in the primary and that sliver of the electorate could matter in a close contest indiana is more important to cruz than it is to trump and his path to 1 237 and three indiana and its 57 delegates on may 3 aren t trump s only path to 1 237 delegates according to our math trump could get shut out of indiana but still win a majority of delegates on a first ballot at the convention if he sweeps california and takes most of its 172 delegates on june 7 and if he wins most of pennsylvania s 54 unbound delegates make no mistake success in indiana would make 1 237 more doable for trump but it isn t his only path indeed indiana is much more important to cruz than it is to trump which explains the alliance cruz and kasich had to do it to keep their candidacies alive nbc wsj marist poll trump up 18 points in pennsylvania speaking of trump s different paths to 1 237 the nbc wsj marist poll of pennsylvania released yesterday shows the real estate mogul leading cruz by 18 points in the keystone state 45 27 with kasich in third at 24 per pennsylvania s delegate allocation rules the statewide winner picks up just 17 delegates but here is why trump winning pennsylvania by 15 to 20 points could be important about two thirds of the candidates running to be one of the 54 unbound delegates to the gop convention say they will either back trump or support the candidate who wins their congressional district if that holds trump could end up winning 52 out of the state s 71 delegates or more and when you add that up to his expected delegate hauls tomorrow in connecticut delaware maryland and rhode island what s going to be the bigger story come wednesday the cruz kasich alliance in indiana or trump s six consecutive primary victories here s the current gop delegate race trump holds a 286 delegate lead over cruz trump needs to win 57 of remaining delegates to reach 1237 magic number this site is protected by recaptchaprivacy policy terms of service cruz needs to win 98 of remaining delegates to reach 1237 magic number kasich needs to win 158 of remaining delegates to reach 1237 magic number sanders i will do everything that i can to make certain that donald trump is not elected president the same nbc wsj marist poll of pennsylvania also found hillary clinton leading bernie sanders in the state 55 40 on meet the press yesterday sanders repeated that he s in the democratic contest until the final votes despite facing the almost insurmountable task of catching clinton in the delegate race we are in this race we are not writing our obituary we re in this race to california and we re proud of the campaign we ran he said asked if he has a responsibility to help clinton if she s the nominee sanders responded i will do everything that i can to make certain that donald trump is not elected president but if that scenario plays out the major responsibility will be on secretary clinton to convince all people not just my supporters that she is the kind of president this country needs to represent working people in this country to take on the big money interests who have so much power to fight for what the american people want but sanders still attacks clinton and even connecticut s democratic governor so that sounded like a bernie sanders who sees the political handwriting on the wall but it didn t stop him from attacking clinton while campaigning in connecticut yesterday per nbc s alex jaffe this campaign unlike secretary clinton s has not raised 15 million from wall street and millions more from other special interests this candidate has not given speeches behind closed doors on wall street for 225 000 a speech he also went after the state s democratic governor dan malloy who was an early endorser of clinton s i m not sure why your governor has cut mental health services in the state here s the democratic delegate math in pledged delegates clinton currently holds a lead of 270 delegates with washington delegates to still be allocated clinton 1427 55 sanders 1157 45 clinton must win 41 of remaining pledged delegates to get a majority in pledged delegates sanders must win 59 of remaining pledged delegates to get a majority in pledged delegates in overall delegates pledged super clinton holds an overall lead of 695 delegates clinton must win 29 of remaining delegates to reach 2383 magic number sanders must win 71 of remaining delegates to reach 2383 magic number charles koch i could possibly back clinton over trump or cruz the other noteworthy news over the weekend was gop mega donor charles koch saying that hillary clinton could be a better presidential candidate for him than trump or cruz abc so is it possible another clinton could be better than another republican this time around koch it s possible it s possible abc you couldn t see yourself supporting hillary clinton could you koch well i that her we would have to believe her actions will be quite different than her rhetoric let me put it that way now that final qualification is important but still msnbc to air town halls featuring sanders at 8 00 pm et and clinton at 9 00 pm et finally msnbc will air two town halls tonight one at 8 00 pm et featuring bernie sanders and the other at clinton 9 00 pm et
