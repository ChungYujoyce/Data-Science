that letter and my senator ended up voting for clarence thomas but it motivated me to get involved in politics as it did so many other women she said and now we go from zero women in that committee to six more recently biden has faced questions after several women said they felt uncomfortable with the way he touched them and as with anita hill biden has yet to really apologize to those women
