advertisement supported by news analysis after saying he would phase out the group the president now says he will keep it but he has regularly ignored the information and guidance it has provided by david e sanger and maggie haberman washington even for a white house that often seeks experts only for affirmation of president trump s instincts his acknowledgment on tuesday that the coronavirus task force would go out of business around memorial day seemed like dismantling the wheelhouse while the ship was still in a raging storm then when the president reversed himself on wednesday he emphasized that he was keeping the task force going because he had discovered that it was popular not because he needed its policy advice its membership might change he said presumably to focus more attention on his clear priority of getting the country back to work all of which raised a question does it matter whether the coronavirus task force lives or dies in ordinary times in washington it would matter a lot it is hardly unusual for presidents to create new structures to navigate a crisis gathering experts who can distill the work of departments and intelligence agencies and drive the execution of complex plans across a sprawling federal bureaucracy it is why harry s truman created the national security council to navigate cold war realities in 1947 and why dwight d eisenhower moved the science adviser into the white house a decade later to deal with the space race it is why john f kennedy met in secret with a committee of experts during the outset of the cuban missile crisis to decide whether war or diplomacy was the right path but the coronavirus task force led by vice president mike pence clearly had a different role it had a psychological resonance with a scared public that wants to see and hear from medical experts after weeks of mr trump s playing down the effect of the virus in the end it was that public facing role rather than the expertise the task force gathered or the recommendations it issued to the states that led mr trump to flip flop i thought we could wind it down sooner the president told reporters on wednesday but i had no idea how popular the task force is until actually yesterday when i started talking about winding down it is appreciated by the public in mr trump s world advisory committees and lawyers are usually there to provide a way for him to put his instincts into operation so it appears with the coronavirus task force which operates alongside other groups that have related responsibilities one is run by jared kushner the president s son in law and senior adviser to find scarce supplies and now to manage the race for a vaccine another is operated inside the domestic policy council members of the coronavirus task force wondered whether their authority was being undercut even while it was still fully functioning and yet they continued meeting daily until recently the question any historian would ask of donald trump s leadership here is what was the role of the experts said the presidential historian michael beschloss how much did he actually listen to them and how much was it simply an effort to show the public that the president was at work on the problem when mr pence took over the task force mr trump had finally accepted that the spread of the virus had created a political challenge advisers said yet it was not until three weeks later that he fully acknowledged there was a growing public health problem on march 10 a day before an oval office address that was filled with errors the president talked to aides about scheduling a rally in florida for two weeks later it never happened on march 16 mr trump announced new guidelines for social distancing then publicly questioned whether they were a good idea for another two weeks before seeing television stories about more than a dozen deaths in one day at elmhurst hospital center in queens where he grew up by the time dr anthony s fauci and dr deborah l birx came to him with projections of up to 2 2 million deaths if more were not done the president had already made up his mind that closures were necessary though according to advisers he imagined a month would suffice the height of the task force s power and perhaps the beginning of its downfall can be traced to mid april that is when dr fauci the government s top infectious disease expert and dr birx who is coordinating the task force s day to day operations developed step by step guidance for states that were considering lifting their lockdowns the president participated in the rollout then he began to undercut it never calling out governors who announced reopenings before meeting the white house s standards he sided instead with protesters looking to open even sooner mr trump of course has never run an ordinary presidency and enjoys bypassing bureaucracies and undercutting experts but there is a reason past presidents relied on new structures to manage new terrifying realities the science office for example was created after the soviets launched sputnik the world s first artificial satellite driving home the need for the united states to rise to a national security educational and technological challenge mr trump waited more than a year and a half into his presidency to appoint a science adviser but it was the cuban missile crisis that underscored the importance of a group of experts that the president could rely on kennedy came to office thinking the national security council was slow unimaginative and bureaucratic mr beschloss said then kennedy stumbled into the bay of pigs a sloppily run failed effort to mount a coup in cuba with a bunch of amateurs and one of his conclusions was that in dealing with the crisis he needed experts with long experience to advise him on whether policies to deal with a crisis would succeed or fail mr beschloss said that is what led to kennedy s executive committee known as ex comm which was contentious argumentative and in the early days of the crisis leaned toward military action that easily could have escalated into nuclear war but over time and with the arrival of new evidence it developed a different approach finding a way to steer clear of mutual annihilation these days the evidence arriving on mr trump s desk shows that while new cases of the coronavirus are declining in the new york city area they are rising in much of the rest of the country medical experts are saying that now is no time to depart from the guidelines issued by the task force only three weeks ago mr trump does not want to hear it but it turns out that he does want to retain the appearance of gathering the best and the brightest i think the white house task force at this juncture is largely symbolic but for a president that 50 percent of the country thinks lies chronically it s sort of reassuring to know that there are other medical professionals and lawmakers keeping their hand on the tiller said douglas brinkley a presidential historian if nothing else he said it serves to reassure a jittery public david e sanger reported from washington and maggie haberman from new york advertisement
