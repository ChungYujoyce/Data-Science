americans for progressive action usa filed campaign finance reports showing more than 2 5 million in advertising and associated costs across a half dozen senate races last week but six ad makers and advertising platforms listed in the filings said they ve never heard of the super pac and have no records of doing business with it advertisement google and facebook s public advertising databases show no hint of the hundreds of thousands of dollars americans for progressive action usa supposedly spent with them gmmb a major democratic consulting firm listed as having received 318 000 from the group said a reporter s inquiry was the first it had heard of the super pac two other washington based vendors listed by the super pac targeted media victory and dixon gruper have no trace of previous activity and aren t registered as corporations in d c according to a search of the city s department of regulatory and consumer affairs database it is not unheard of for people to make false filings with the fec one prankster in 2016 became a brief internet phenomenon after filing paperwork for a candidate named deez nuts but more than a dozen political operatives and campaign finance watchdogs contacted for this story were baffled why someone would file apparently made up spending reports with the fec americans for progressive action usa isn t following the traditional m o of scam pacs which typically prey on small dollar donors by convincing them they re giving money to support a political cause when the money actually lines the pockets of the pac s operators but filing detailed fec reports could be an attempt to create the appearance of credibility for some other means i ve seen cases when candidates reported all these fake donors and all these fake expenses so they can come out and say they raised all this money money begets money said nancy watkins an experienced republican treasurer of political committees there s very wealthy people who are easily fooled watkins was the treasurer of americans for progressive action a republican group that waded into the 2013 special senate election in massachusetts that similarly named group closed up after the election and has

jones is disconnected when politico sent an email to an icloud address listed on the fec report seeking more information on the group jones responded hours later with an email address from the domain progressactionusa org saying someone working on a communications team would be in contact but then jones went silent and multiple emails to him and the communications team he referenced seeking an explanation of the group s filings went unanswered there is no active website located at the progressactionusa web address and registration information for the website indicates it was registered via proxy on the day a reporter initially reached out for comment additionally a twitter account representing itself as belonging to the super pac did not respond to tweets directed toward it and has
