 sanders success in texas is an expression of a real change that given the very demographics democrats have been anticipating for years will continue to shape the party s electoral fortunes by jim henson and joshua blank march 2 20204 pm many democratic strategists and elected officials in texas have joined their national comrades fretting over the prospect of bernie sanders as the democrats standard bearer in their crusade to prevent donald trump s reelection the concerns have been particularly acute as anti sanders texas democrats worry over the party s prospects for flipping congressional and state legislative seats the common denominator in the fretting captured in recent texas tribune story featuring interviews with democratic elected officials and consultants is that sanders is too far to the left of the texas democratic electorate but sanders is as much an expression of changing conditions as he is an agent of change as sanders might be quick to paraphrase he may be making history but as a group texas democrats have gotten more liberal over the last decade data from the most recent university of texas texas tribune poll reveals the splash sanders makes in the ideological currents defining texas democratic party while a larger body of ut tt poll data over the last 10 years shows the share of self identified liberals gradually but steadily increasing as texas democrats increasingly reflect the national ideological sorting of voters between the two major parties support for the most progressive candidates in the most recent ut texas tribune poll comes from expected constituencies among texas democrats among self identified liberals 31 of democrats preferred sanders while 22 preferred elizabeth warren among those who identified as extremely liberal most preferred either sanders 45 or warren 30 sanders was the top choice of democratic primary voters under 40 34 followed at some distance by warren 13 the top choice of voters over 40 was joe biden biden continues to lead sanders in texas among democrats age 45 and older while sanders is by far the most favored candidate among voters under 30 as democrats vow yet again to tip the partisan balance by bringing new young voters to the polls those voters remain a small share of overall turnout even as they become a larger part of the electorate of course should sanders falter or have the nomination wrested from him the fear that his young followers will turn out for another candidate is real as is the expectation that they will turn out in droves if he is in fact the nominee sanders has less than majority support in a crowded field in which the votes for democratic moderates are divided among several candidates as his skeptics note the primacy of the divided moderate vote is the foundation for the argument now back in vogue after biden s firewall win in south carolina and pete buttigieg s decision to suspend his campaign that consolidation behind biden will reassert a center left democratic majority in the ut tt poll biden ran first among moderates 27 followed by michael bloomberg with 16 with sanders in third with 12 however trend data over the last 10 years shows the share of moderates in the texas democratic party declining at the same time as the share of liberals increased between 2008 and 2016 the share of democrats who identified as liberal was just under 47 in polling from 2017 through 2019 the average increased 12 percentage points to 59 in the same time frames the number of moderates declined from an average of 46 in polls from 2008 to 2016 to an average of 29 in polling conducted between 2017 and 2019 in the most recent ut tt poll 64 of democrats identified as liberal compared with only 27 who identified as moderate in october 2012 right before barack obama s reelection in which he lost texas by 12 percentage points 43 of texas democrats identified as liberal 45 as moderate as the moderate presence has given way to a larger share of liberals liberal democrats have also become more intense in their liberalism among democrats who identified as liberal in the february 2014 ut tt poll 20 leaned liberal 17 described themselves as somewhat liberal and 9 as extremely liberal six years later in february 2020 16 leaned liberal 29 were somewhat liberal and 19 were extremely liberal the average percentage of democrats who described themselves as extremely liberal in ut tt polling from 2014 and 2015 was 11 5 in 2018 and 2019 polls the average increased to 21 5 a different look at the ideological preferences in the most prominent quarters of the texas democratic electorate offers some surprises about where this liberalism resides within the party a recurring question in ut tt polling channels goldilocks to ask democrats whether they think democratic elected officials in texas are too liberal not liberal enough or liberal enough 44 said democratic elected officials were not liberal enough only 6 said they were too liberal and 30 said they were just right while this isn t a direct measure of support for the democratic socialist sanders who is definitely not a texas elected official and is arguably beyond the normal description of liberal it does bear on the broad judgment of democratic consultants and candidates wringing their hands about sanders potential impact on their voters the biggest gap in democrats assessments of their elected officials liberalism is by race 58 of white democrats want them more liberal compared with 39 of latinos and 26 of african american democrats in the suburbs where professional democrats seem to most fear sanders destructive impact on their prospects 46 of democratic voters find their elected officials insufficiently liberal slightly higher than urban democrats 43 there is no appreciable difference between older and younger democrats on this measure those with college degrees were somewhat more likely to draw the same conclusion than those without but not by a wide margin 40 and 49 respectively this intersection of racial and generational tensions within the democratic coalition evident in the results and the exit polling in south carolina where older black voters fueled biden s victory is evident in texas too while sample sizes prevent confident slicing of the ut tt data by party age and race sanders and biden s division of latino and black primary voters in the ut tt poll and most other texas polling suggests white liberals and younger black and latino democrats are inclined to support more aggressively progressive candidates white urban liberals embrace of sanders coexists uneasily with the centrality of black and latino voting blocs which are demonstrably less enthused about bernie s revolution but also taken together are historically more likely to show up to vote a sanders nomination would test the durability of these voters partisan commitments in the general election much as the nomination of almost any other candidate would test the party loyalties of sanders youthful followers either way in texas these tensions strain plans to use trump s galvanizing effect on democrats of all ideological stripes to continue chipping away at republican majorities in the congressional and state legislative delegations these consequential short term democratic problems notwithstanding the democratic party that texas consultants and poobahs have presided over during many years in the political wilderness has changed during their exile from power the question with the most long term consequences is whether democratic incumbents and operatives will recognize that they have to adapt to the realities of their present coalition and close ranks if sanders wins the nomination his success in texas is an expression of a real change that given the very demographics democrats have been anticipating for years will continue to shape the party s electoral fortunes even if the received wisdom about where to
