 2020 elections the president settles on a schoolyard strategy to take out his likely general election opponent democratic presidential candidate joe biden dilip vishwanat getty images by alex isenstadt 03 10 2020 04 30 am edt link copied president donald trump stood before about 500 of the republican party s biggest patrons at his mar a lago resort on friday and raised a topic few in the audience expected joe biden s mental capacity trump walked the donors through a list of biden s recent verbal stumbles such as his recent declaration that he was running for senate and his assertion that 150 million americans had been killed by gun violence since 2007 trump questioned whether the former vice president had the mental stamina to sustain the rigors of a general election campaign advertisement then the president appeared to give donors permission to leak his remarks about biden to the media i would hope you not repeat that trump said sarcastically according to an attendee with biden emerging as the likely democratic nominee trump has launched a concerted near daily campaign to raise doubts about the 77 year old s mental acuity the president has been bolstered by a conservative echo chamber flooding social media with video clips highlighting biden s gaffes the effort provides a window into how trump who s been dogged by questions about his own mental fitness regularly picks apart his political opponents he has an unmatched ability to zero in on his foe s biggest vulnerability or insecurity and through sheer repetition bake it into the public consciousness unfortunately for biden his performance on the campaign trail has given trump plenty to work with it s similar to the tack trump used in 2016 against hillary clinton whom he tagged as low energy he also suggested she doesn t have the stamina to be president former clinton advisers see a replay of that campaign and warn that biden needs to take the attacks seriously he s not responding to the threat strong enough because it is absolutely a problem now and is going to be a problem going forward said philippe reines a former top hillary clinton adviser who prepped her for the debates with trump you have to defend yourself because that stuff absolutely sticks trump has long branded biden as sleepy joe but in the week following biden s win in the south carolina democratic primary trump has taken it a step further by questioning the former vice president s mental faculties the president took to twitter to say that biden doesn t know where he is or what he s doing and said biden would destroy entitlement programs and he won t even know he s doing it wow sleepy joe doesn t know where he is or what he s doing honestly i don t think he even knows what office he s running for pic twitter com 454v9gfpgf the president went at biden again during a rally in charlotte n c last week saying that once elected biden would be put into a home and other people are going to be running the country then during a fox news town hall thursday evening trump pointed to a string of recent biden gaffes including the former vice president s remark that super tuesday was taking place on super thursday there s something going on there trump said trump is getting backup from his sprawling political apparatus the republican national committee last week circulated a clip showing biden appearing to confuse his wife and his sister distributed social media posts making fun of the former vice president for his super thursday remark and cut a video depicting biden botching a line from the declaration of independence some of the president s conservative allies are taking the attack even further during a saturday appearance on fox news trump attorney rudy giuliani said biden is showing obvious signs of dementia fox news host sean hannity meanwhile devoted an entire segment of his show to documenting how biden has a very questionable grip on reality tucker carlson another trump friendly fox news host said biden is clearly losing it trump allies say the president s attacks are damaging because he homes in on vulnerabilities in a way that sticks with voters the president is expert at indelibly tagging his opponents with nicknames that resonate in flyover country he is similarly adept at identifying and highlighting his opponents shortcomings in unavoidable and ubiquitous commentary said michael caputo a trump 2016 campaign aide with trump s constant reminders caputo added voters won t be able to look away from biden s guaranteed gaffes and this will amplify existing concerns to weigh down the former vice president trump campaign officials said the president is merely highlighting the mistakes biden is making joe biden was a terrible candidate the first two times he ran for president said tim murtaugh a spokesman for the trump reelection effort i don t know why anyone expected he would be better the third time around biden has laughed off the attacks during a recent appearance on fox news sunday the former vice president was asked to respond to a clip of trump saying that he would be sitting in a home someplace if elected is that the stable genius

see biden s verbal hiccups as part of his charm the assault they argue reflects the profound degree to which trump is threatened by the former vice president trump was impeached by the democratic led house last year over allegations that he pressured the ukrainian government into investigating biden and his family with the democratic party galvanized by the best candidate to win crucial battleground states it s not surprising that trump s reelection campaign is resorting to more disinformation about the vice president after all trump himself is so panicked about joe biden that he got himself impeached by trying to force a foreign country to lie about him said andrew bates a biden campaign spokesman the attacks on biden bear a striking resemblance to the ones trump launched against clinton four years ago in 2016 trump was similarly echoed by an array of conservative allies the pro trump breitbart news published a series of articles about clinton s health including one that linked to a story on a conservative website alleging the former secretary of state was engaging in bizarre behavior and questioned whether she had a seizure infowars another pro trump site that peddles in conspiracy theories piled on with a piece exploring whether clinton had parkinson s disease the onslaught only intensified after clinton suffered a bout of pneumonia while attending a sept 11 memorial event clinton allies said the attacks took a toll reines urged biden to respond forcefully by raising questions about trump s mental fitness and about why the president hasn t been more forthcoming about his health it s an absolute layup reines said and the vice president bless his soul doesn t seem to take to what he probably thinks is mean or adversarial but this is the business we ve chosen as the godfather said other democrats however aren t so sure trump s offensive will work jennifer palmieri who served as communications director on clinton s campaign pointed out that trump has been savaging biden for months with questionable results democratic and independent voters she said were tuning out the attacks the trump campaign has been hitting biden and his family for over a year and the attacks don t seem to weaken him with voters palmieri said he just gets stronger link copied 2020 politico llc
