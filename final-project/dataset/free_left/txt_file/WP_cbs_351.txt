enter mediation after the 2019 women s world cup on july 7 the uswnt won a record fourth world cup in 2016 members of the team spoke with norah o donnell for 60 minutes below is a transcript of that story few teams have been as glorious on the soccer field as the united states women s national team they ve won three world cups four olympic gold medals and set the standard in the most popular sport on the planet but despite their achievements the players say they have been discriminated against paid less and treated worse next to the u s men s team soccer may be known as the beautiful game but the team has embarked on a bruising and historic legal fight for equality and their opponent is the u s soccer federation their own employer for the players it s the match of their lives they hope a victory will help close the gap not just in sport but in any job where women do the same work as men for less pay editor s note the u s soccer federation shared this statementwith 60 minutes carli lloyd we feel like we re treated like second class citizens because they don t care as much about us as they do the men carli lloyd is considered the best female soccer player in the world and captains the u s team we recently spoke to her co captain becky sauerbrunn and their teammates christen press and morgan brian norah o donnell there s a long history of athletes battling their employers for more pay it happens in the nba it happens in the nfl what s different about this fight christen press this is a social movement i think this is about gender discrimination and i don t think that positive change occurs in the world unless it has to norah o donnell how does this fight rank in some of the competitions you ve been in becky sauerbrunn it s the fight you know i mean we have been in some some major some major battles on the field but this is this could be the fight that we are a part of the team is made up of the best female soccer players from around the country and for 25 years they ve ruled the world in 1999 when brandi chastain scored to beat china in the finals of the world cup her celebration announced the beginning of a new era in women s sports for the 2015 final an estimated 30 million people watched on tv in the u s as carli lloyd s three goals sealed a huge win against japan it was and remains the highest rated soccer match in american history including games played by the u s men carli lloyd we re america s dream team and we ve been at the forefront we ve been at the top and i think the no 1 team in women s sports history norah o donnell how has u s soccer federation helped you guys make it to where you are becky sauerbrunn when you compare this federation to all the other federations across the globe they have invested the most money in this women s program they have and that s why we ve gotten as far as we have but to be paid equally you know it s it s not about what they think it s fair it s it s what is fair after their 2015 world cup triumph the team was honored with a parade down new york city s canyon of heroes but behind the ticker tape their relationship with u s soccer was breaking down over a new contract outspoken goalkeeper hope solo was on the team for 19 years hope solo time and time again we asked that we wanted to be paid equally to the men and i ll never h norah o donnell you ve been asking for that for many years hope solo yeah we have we have every time we brought up the men it pissed them off it annoyed them and they d say don t bring up the men don t bring it up globally men s soccer is undeniably more popular and profitable than the women s game when germany won the world cup in 2014 fifa the sports international governing body awarded them 35 million a year later when the u s women won the cup the u s soccer federation received 2 million men also make major league salaries playing for brand name club teams women s pro clubs have struggled financially so the women say they rely on their national team income to pay their bills unlike the men norah o donnell how are they paid differently hope solo no there s two different pay structures the men get paid per game whether they win or lose they get paid the women were on a salary based contract it s a pay structure the women themselves wanted and agreed to in 2005 and again in 2013 a consistent salary of up to 72 000 a year and bonuses for wins of 1 350 they also get health insurance and maternity leave the men enjoy no guaranteed salary and fewer personal benefits but they can make as much as 17 625 dollars for a win we wanted to compare two of the top players salaries vary but in 2015 hope solo was paid about 366 000 dollars in total by u s soccer in 2014 also a world cup year for the men team usa goalkeeper tim howard was paid 398 495 she played in 23 games for the u s he played in 8 hope solo when you break it down per game i think it s about three times as much two years ago hope solo convinced the team to hire lawyer rich nichols to try to get them a better contract rich nichols i said look you are in control this is your business you have to take control of it and you can be in control of it but you have to be unified you ve gotta get a new deal norah o donnell what kind of deal would the women accept rich nichols equal equal pay norah o donnell well what does equal mean you want the same agreement the men have rich nichols we want the same money that the men are making exactly that s 5 000 minimum that s that 8 000 bonus if you tie a game and the 17 625 if you win we want equal money morgan brian we have to win and perform in order to even make 1 350 norah o donnell you re professional women you signed this deal you look back and say why did i agree to that deal becky sauerbrunn a little bit but it s also when it comes down to it we just kind of had to be like oh you re just gonna say no to everything that we re putting on the table and so we didn t know how to fight and in which ways we could fight norah o donnell do you think you should be paid more than the men s team carli lloyd yeah absolutely norah o donnell why carli lloyd we win we re successful should get what we deserve last year the top female players did make more money from u s soccer than the men s team but their lawyer rich nichols says that s only because they played and won more games than the men rich nichols when you subtract the bonus money that these women made in 2015 you know they re probably making 72 000 80 000 apiece norah o donnell so you mean had they not been winning they would not have made anywhere close to what the men made rich nichols that s right despite being upset at last summer s olympics the women are still no 1 in the world according to fifa they say their fight is only with u s soccer not with the u s men s team who are ranked a respectable if unspectacular 24th in the world president obama this team taught all america s children that playing like a girl means you re a bad ass on stage at the white house in october 2015 they were national heroes celebrating their latest world cup win back on the job they were disgruntled workers whose negotiations with u s soccer had ground to a halt and grown increasingly bitter the women decided to change tactics enter the federal agency known as the eeoc or the equal employment opportunity commission norah o donnell why file this suit with the eeoc becky sauerbrunn we wanted to put pressure on them and so with the eeoc complaint it seemed like a no brainer for us their complaint accuses u s soccer of violating the equal pay act and title vii which protects employees against discrimination based on sex the commission has the power to award damages issue the right for workers to sue or do nothing at all norah o donnell this has never been done before rich nichols no not by professional athletes no norah o donnell why is this case so different rich nichols because it s there s never been a situation where the same employer has hired men and women to play the same sport under the same working conditions norah o donnell like the wnba and the nba are two separate organizations rich nichols correct same same employer same job same work conditions same everything the federations lawyers responded to the eeoc complaint by saying any differences in the compensation paid men and women players are driven by factors other than gender major factors according to u s soccer are revenue and tv ratings they say men s games on channels like espn average audiences four times larger than the women but the federation sells both teams to broadcasters and sponsors as one entity this year for about 45 million dollars the president of u s soccer is sunil gulati he teaches economics at columbia university we requested an interview with mr gulati but he declined in a statement the federation said they are actively working to reach a new agreement with the women s team becky sauerbrunn and they re looking backwards you know we re looking to go forwards from now and on and we ve shown and they ve projected in their own financials that we are going to make them money so it s i think unfair to pay us less based on performances in the past according to u s soccer s own projections for this year the women will net about 5 million from ticket sales while the men will lose about a million dollars but it turns out this labor dispute is about more than just money 60 minutes has learned the eeoc is also asking questions about the differences between the men and women when it comes to playing conditions equipment and travel norah o donnell how do the women travel to games carli lloyd well we fly in coach norah o donnell the men though is part of their agreement fly first class carli lloyd yes morgan brian to be able to perform like we do and to be the best in the world we should be treated the same as them we were curious what this fight means to a younger generation of female soccer players asia horne analiese schwartz sarah sullivan and joelle kelly told us they closely follow the women s national team on social media they play for marymount an all girls school in manhattan and for local soccer clubs where they ve also noticed differences in how the male and female teams are treated asia horne the boys teams would get more field time than the girls teams we would have to share space with other age groups while the boys would have full field norah o donnell so joelle given what the disparities that you ve noticed and what you re witnessing the u s women s soccer team do what s the lesson that you learn from that joelle kelly what they re doing is for us so we can have that equal pay and that so that we can be on the same level as men the women s contract with u s soccer expires this coming new year s eve whether or not the eeoc decides in their favor they say they will remain focused on their goal with all options on the table norah o donnell if you don t get a ruling from the eeoc if you don t get what you want from the soccer federation will you go on strike becky sauerbrunn it would be a discussion that we would have to have norah o donnell there s a possibility that they may strike if they don t get equal pay would you support that voices together yes norah o donnell why female voice cause nothing s gonna change if they don t stand up for what they want they re never gonna get it norah o donnell would you like to meet some women on the u s women s soccer team voices together yes yes norah o donnell what does it mean to meet these guys female voice the world carli lloyd this is history making what we re doing what we re fighting for it not only resonates with this team and with generations to come but it s global as well norah o donnell carli you keep saying you re united how far are you gonna take this carli lloyd until we get what we want norah o donnell is the anchor and managing editor of the cbs evening news she also contributes to 60 minutes
