hillary clinton falling ill sunday morning at a memorial service onthe 15th anniversary of the sept 11 attacks will catapult questions about her health from the ranks of conservative conspiracy theory to perhaps the central debate in the presidential race over the coming days secretary clinton attended the september 11th commemoration ceremonyfor just an hour and thirty minutes this morning to pay her respectsand greet some of the families of the fallen spokesman nick merrill said during the ceremony shefelt overheated so departed to go to her daughter s apartment and isfeeling much better what that statement leaves out is that a it came 90 minutes after clinton left the ceremony b reporters or even a reporter were not allowed to follow her and c the temperature in new york city at the time of clinton s overheating was in the low 80s a heat wave over the eastern united states broke last night this morning she later lefther daughter s apartment saying she was feeling great and waving at the crowd per the associated press clinton was diagnosed friday with pneumonia according to her doctor who ascribed her illness on sunday to that ailment whether clinton likes it or not her overheating episode comes at a very bad time for her campaign thanks to the likes of rudy giuliani and a small but vocal element of the republican base talk of herhealth had been bubbling over the past week triggered by a coughing episode she experienced during a labor day rally that talk was largely confined to republicans convinced that clinton has long been hiding some sort of serious illness i wrote dismissively of that conspiracy theory in this space last week noting that clinton had been given an entirely clean bill of health by her doctors after an episode in which she fainted suffered a concussion and then was found to have a blood clot in late 2012 and early 2013 coughing i wrote is simply not evidence enough of any sort of major illness thatclinton isassumed to behiding neither of course is feeling overheated but those two things happening within six days of eachother to a candidate who is 68 years old makes talk of clinton s health no longer just the stuff of conspiracy theorists whereas clinton and her campaign could laugh off questions about her health beforetoday the overheating episode makes it almost impossible for them to do so not only has it come at a time when there was growing chatter with very little evidence that her health was a problem but it also happened at a 9 11 memorial event an incredibly high profile moment with lots and lots of cameras and reporters around her campaign may well try to dismiss this story as nothing more than an isolated incident meaning nothing democrats were already pushing the story of george w bush fainting in 2002 after choking on a pretzel via twitter but the issue is that clinton kept reporters totally in the dark for 90 minutes afterher abrupt departure from the 9 11 memorial service for a health related matter no reporter was allowed to follow her clinton has resisted a protective pool for coverage because donald trump refuses to participate in one this is yet again the clinton campaign asking everyone to just trust it she got overheated but she s fine now clinton may well be totally fine and i certainly hope she is but we are 58 days away from choosing the person who willlead the country for the next four years and she is one of the two candidates with a real chance ofwinning taking the clinton team s word for it on her health in light of the episode on sunday morning is no longer enough reasonable people can and will have real questions about her health i wrote this on tuesday morning well that is no longer operative context matters a coughing episode is almost always just a coughing episode but when coupled with clinton s overheating on sunday morning with temperatures something short of sweltering clinton and her team simply need to say something about what happened and why the press was in the dark for so long and as the new york times s adam nagourney tweeted on sunday morning now might be a good time for clinton to release a fuller record of her medical history feels like a good day for clinton to release her medical records and call on trump to do same sunday morning changed the conversation in the race about clinton s health or rather it will force clinton to have a conversation about her health in the race receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
