 2016 most of the vp candidates under consideration are relatively unknown to voters by steven shepard 07 07 2016 05 18 am edt updated 07 07 2016 10 30 am edt donald trump is believed to be looking at newt gingrich and chris christie among others getty donald trump and hillary clinton are each hoping to get a bump from their vice presidential nominees but polling data show that most of the candidates on their shortlists are unknown to voters even the ones who cut high profiles inside the beltway almost half of voters on average haven t yet formed an opinion of sen elizabeth warren d mass who is viewed as a progressive beacon by washington pundits at least two thirds don t know anything about sen tim kaine d va who is thought to lead clinton s shortlist advertisement it s the same problem with trump despite the reality tv star s reported desire for a running mate with star power most of his vp prospects are state level politicians who lack significant national profiles and those who have established name identification among voters like new jersey gov chris christie and former house speaker newt gingrich would carry substantial baggage that means that national polling is limited for many of the top contenders though some like kaine and sen joni ernst r iowa who sounded a lukewarm note about joining the ticket in an interview with politico on wednesday have more name id in key battleground states monmouth university the new jersey school with an expanding public polling operation asked voters last month whether a dozen different possible running mates would make them more or less likely to support each party s ticket by nick gass most of the candidates didn t move the needle even those who are well known in washington that s usually what really happens said monmouth pollster patrick murray voters murray said don t make the same calculus that strategists do when considering possible running mates while pundits will belabor regional balance and ideological balance and personality and all of these things voters don t really look at that he said they look at did you make a solid choice here s a look at where the most oft mentioned candidates stand according to public opinion republicans newt gingrich gingrich is probably the best known candidate in trump s stable of possible running mates but the former georgia congressman s image ratings have been historically poor since the republicans took over the house in the 1994 elections and installed gingrich as speaker gingrich reached the peak of his unpopularity in the waning days of his doomed campaign four years ago his favorable rating was just 25 percent in a cnn orc poll in mid february 2012 with a whopping 63 percent viewing him unfavorably gallup and cbs news new york times found similar splits there s some limited evidence the antipathy toward gingrich is less intense now the monmouth poll found slightly more voters 26 percent say they would be less likely to vote for trump if he picked gingrich than would be more likely to vote for him 24 percent the other half of voters said gingrich s selection wouldn t make an impact or didn t know among voters undecided between trump and clinton it s 19 percent more likely vs 29 percent less likely meanwhile the online pollster yougov quizzed voters about a number of candidates in a survey sponsored by the economist and conducted over the independence day weekend surveys conducted over holiday weekends can miss voters who travel or are busy but the results also showed a slight moderation in views toward gingrich though significantly more voters still view him unfavorably 48 percent than favorably 32 percent chris christie the new jersey governor is the only other possible trump pick with a substantial national presence but it s mostly a negative one the aggregation website huffpost pollster pegged christie s average favorable rating at only 30 percent with an unfavorable rating of 48 percent the polls that compose those averages were conducted before christie ended his presidential campaign in february recent surveys from cnn orc 32 percent favorable 44 percent unfavorable and yougov 34 percent favorable 48 percent unfavorable were similar as for christie s effect on the ticket the monmouth poll showed a distinct negative tilt twenty percent would be more likely to vote for trump if he reached across the hudson river to tap christie while 28 percent would be less likely to vote for him it s even more lopsided among undecided voters fifteen percent would be more likely to vote for a trump christie ticket and 36 percent would be less likely the others jeff sessions has served in the senate for nearly 20 years but few americans outside his home state of alabama know who he is in the monmouth poll only 9 percent said picking the fourth term senator would make them more likely to vote for trump and just 17 percent said it would make them less likely to vote for trump nearly three quarters said it wouldn t have an impact or didn t know it was similar in the yougov poll with more than 6 in 10 online respondents unable to express an opinion about sessions ernst all but removed herself from consideration wednesday but last month s monmouth poll shows she would be more or less a blank slate roughly eight in 10 voters say picking the freshman senator wouldn t have an impact on whether they would vote for trump or didn t know enough to say even in her home state of iowa where trump and clinton will be fighting over the state s six electoral votes ernst has a limited profile she had a positive approval rating in a des moines register mediacom poll in late february 43 percent approve 31 percent disapprove but a quarter of iowans couldn t express an opinion about her job performance indiana gov mike pence met with trump this past weekend reportedly to discuss the job but despite 10 years in congress the first term governor hasn t been tested in a national poll neither the monmouth poll nor the yougov survey included pence as a potential running mate indiana gov mike pence ap photo pence s home state isn t a traditional battleground state though president barack obama carried it narrowly in 2008 still polls indicate pence faces a difficult reelection campaign if he isn t trump s running mate and he s unlikely to boost trump in the state if he s on the ticket a survey in april showed pence with just a 4 percentage point lead over his democratic opponent and the republican s favorable rating 44 percent was only marginally better than the percentage who viewed him unfavorably 41 percent democrats tim kaine this is kaine s second time on a democratic presidential nominee s shortlist in 2008 when kaine was serving his only term as virginia governor he was considered by barack obama but despite that past exposure kaine has virtually no national profile nearly two thirds of respondents said they didn t have an opinion of him in the yougov poll and a combined 78 percent of voters said he d have no impact on whether they d vote for clinton or didn t know 2016 by gabriel debenedetti virginia is a key battleground state and kaine s ratings there are positive if lackluster an automated telephone survey from public policy polling a democratic outfit found kaine s approval rating at 42 percent with 35 percent disapproval only 32 percent of virginians surveyed in a january roanoke college poll had a favorable impression of kaine and just 26 percent viewed him unfavorably that s lower than other previous polls have showed for kaine his approval rating was 52 percent in a july 2015 quinnipiac university poll compared to only 30 percent who disapproved elizabeth warren inside washington warren has been a star of the progressive wing of the democratic party and a conservative b te noire since she was elected to the senate in 2012 she s been a frequent trump target with the presumptive republican nominee derisively referring to her as pocahontas on the stump and on social media but despite that attention voters opinions of her are not well formed a cnn orc poll last month showed roughly equal percentages of voters had favorable 31 percent and unfavorable 29 percent opinions of warren but more significantly 27 percent of voters said they had never heard of the massachusetts senator and another 13 percent had no opinion of her by nolan d mccaskill and daniel lippman the yougov survey found slightly higher name id for warren that s partially to be expected since research shows participants in online panel surveys tend to be more politically engaged than average citizens but there s still a split in her favorability 37 percent favorable 35 percent unfavorable 28 percent don t know like kaine the monmouth poll suggests warren would be a wash on the ticket twenty four percent said they would be more likely to vote for clinton compared to 21 percent who would be less likely a 51 percent majority said picking warren would have no impact and 5 percent were undecided cory booker booker has been in the senate for only three years but he has an established political persona and nearly 2 million twitter followers that persona however is little known outside washington and his home state of new jersey new jersey sen cory booker ap photo only 13 percent of voters in the monmouth poll said picking booker would make them more likely to vote for clinton the same percentage who said it would make them less likely the vast majority of voters said it either would have no impact 64 percent or they didn t know 10 percent in the yougov survey a 55 percent majority had no opinion of the former newark mayor the others housing and urban development secretary juli n castro didn t register on either the yougov 61 percent don t know or the monmouth 74 percent no impact or don t know surveys same for sen sherrod brown d ohio about whom fully two thirds of yougov respondents declined to express an opinion more than any potential other vp hopeful in that survey neither poll tested rep xavier becerra d calif or labor secretary tom perez but they would likely be equally anonymous the only potential democrat who moved the needle significantly in the monmouth survey was sen bernie sanders i vt who is unlikely to be selected by clinton but 39 percent of voters said last month that picking her rival for the nomination would make them more likely to vote for clinton compared to only 20 percent who said it would make them less likely to vote for her and 39 percent who said it wouldn t have an impact by nolan d mccaskill picking a candidate without an established profile isn t risky in and of itself research shows few voters make their presidential choice based on who is sharing the ticket and choosing a running mate from a battleground state doesn t always help in that state but if a candidate with little experience struggles when introduced on the national stage as then alaska gov sarah palin did in the closing month of the 2008 campaign it can dog the ticket she initially made a positive impact because of how surprising the pick was but it was ultimately a negative impact said murray polls showed that palin s favorable ratings skyrocketed after she was introduced by sen john mccain r ariz but receded to a slightly net negative position by election day voters look at this as the first decision this candidate makes as president murray added what does this say about their decision making ability missing out on the latest scoops sign up
