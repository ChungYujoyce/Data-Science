 by annie karni 05 30 2015 12 46 pm edt hillary clinton s presidential campaign late last week obtained access to the full ready for hillary email list a data gold mine that will immediately bolster the democratic front runner s fundraising and organizing efforts the campaign gained entry to the independent super pac s list through a swap with another independent group a democrat with knowledge of the list told politico and is expected to begin emailing it immediately the source declined to identify the other group advertisement access to the list of close to 4 million names came after senior campaign officials admitted they were relying in part on an outdated supporter list from 2008 for two years ready for hillary s primary purpose was to create a plug and play list of supporter names with contact information that represented an energized base of people who could be tapped for money or volunteering also on politico ben schreckinger but for the first six weeks of clinton s 2016 presidential campaign that data trove was unavailable and tied up with lawyers reviewing the options available to the campaign they could trade an old list for the new list or rent a la carte pieces of the list like for example names of volunteers in iowa they would need before a campaign stop there eventually however the campaign decided it was easier to have access to the entire list i could offer about 4 million reasons why the ready for hillary list is an important resource said tracy sefl a democratic strategist who served as a senior adviser to the independent super pac before it shut down to understand why access to the list is so important consider the recent experience of lynette hull a 17 year old high school student from las vegas who was one of the first interns to sign up with the campaign after clinton announced she was running a national honors society student at liberty high school hull was quickly put to work phone banking working through an old database of clinton supporters to sign up new volunteers also on politico annie karni and kenneth p vogel the work proved time consuming and unproductive it s a lot of no pickups hull said of her experience i recently did about 60 phone calls about 20 picked up and a lot of those said they were too old to get out and volunteer there is some overlap of the ready for hillary list and the campaign s own list of supporters for starters when clinton officially announced her presidential bid six weeks ago ready for hillary emailed its list six times encouraging them to sign up with the official campaign clinton staffers have also been signing up new supporters in the early states on their own a clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment for this report missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020 politico llc
