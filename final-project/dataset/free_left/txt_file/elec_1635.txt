volunteers from across the midwest and as far away as california are streaming into iowa to help get the vote out organizers on iowa campuses are reserving rooms to turn into phone bank centers distributing campaign provided toe warmers to the foot soldiers and playing mr sanders s spoken word version of this land is your land to motivate them ahead of feb 1 the day iowa voters finally have their say the sanders campaign is activating go home for bernie a plan to dispatch a fleet of rental cars vans and buses if necessary to carry students who are from iowa back to their hometowns where they will have maximum impact on the caucuses with his talk of free tuition unabashed unhipness and calls for political revolution mr sanders has undoubtedly struck a chord with young people but they are one of the least dependable constituencies in politics and his campaign acknowledges that beating hillary clinton in iowa will require harnessing their enthusiasm overcoming their history of dismal attendance and replicating the 2008 turnout inspired by the historic candidacy of barack obama we are working very hard to make that happen mr sanders a vermont senator said in an interview on thursday that is exactly what we are focusing on right now to election day he added of the 15 000 people in iowa who have done at least one volunteer shift 27 percent are 18 to 24 years old and 32 percent are 25 to 34 according to the campaign the campaign has at least one representative essentially a precinct captain on 38 iowa college campuses where students will spend the final days calling likely voters holding caucus training camps and figuring out how to get the greatest number of supporters to the largest number of precincts if you have a car said dhruv gupta 21 the president of grinnellians for sanders at grinnell college you are enlisted and then we fill it up with as many people as we can mrs clinton 68 also has sought to appeal to young voters setting up her headquarters in brooklyn starring in a snapchat video saying just chillin in cedar rapids and rolling out endorsements from katy perry and lena dunham who campaigned for mrs clinton in iowa but it is mr sanders who like mr obama before him has captured the imagination of many young voters this is despite mr sanders s being a 74 year old with white hair who plays up the grumpiness of the social studies substitute teacher he once was i know the young people will think this is impossible when i was elected mayor of burlington we did not have a computer in city hall can you imagine that mr sanders said here tuesday the stage behind him was packed with supporters in their teens and 20s seated under a banner saying a future to believe in hard to imagine mr sanders continued george washington bernie sanders jared freemon 20 a junior economics and marketing major at drake university in des moines said he liked mr sanders s ideas about making public college free and providing health care for all as well as the senator s candor in talking about the injustices minorities face i think he cares for people in america so whether it s immigrants or people coming over our borders or the black and brown populations here i can tell that he really does want equality mr freemon said in new hampshire where the primary will be held feb 9 veri di suvero a student at dartmouth college said she also liked the senator s proposals but mostly just believed that he believed in the revolution he called for bernie sanders is the most unproblematic old white man we ve ever heard of she said in a new york times cbs news poll this month mr sanders held a commanding national lead among democratic voters under 45 with 60 percent to mrs clinton s 31 percent expanding the voting universe to include more young people is central to his strategy in iowa and new hampshire where he has been faring well in polls but as the race moves on to more diverse states mrs clinton is hoping those gains will be outweighed by her support among african americans and latinos two key democratic constituencies with which she is performing strongly in counting on the young mr sanders is swimming against a strong current of history younger citizens tend not to vote in 2000 for instance when both parties had competitive races only 9 percent of iowa caucusgoers were under 30 according to researchers based at the university of maryland school of public policy the exception came in 2008 when mr obama made young people a key part of the iowa coalition that propelled him to victory that year 19 percent of caucusgoers were under 30 that was despite an early january caucus date when many college students were on break the obama campaign had to persuade students from out of state to come back according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president this year mr sanders has the opposite challenge college students will be in school but concentrated in precincts around the universities where he is already expected to do well the sanders campaign has to persuade students who come from other parts of iowa to go back to their home precincts where a few votes could be the difference the campaign is even looking past the college ranks and sending campaign literature to high school seniors who will be 18 by the general election and thus qualified to caucus it has also created a website provethemwrongandcaucus com that dares disaffected kids to vote john della volpe the director of polling at harvard s institute of politics said mr sanders s pull among the young was about being authentic and also about how he had reached out to them they really want to be part of the political process and they want to be empowered he said they want to be wined and dined a little bit they want to feel special and he is making that extra effort that others aren t before mr sanders even announced his candidacy he had a dedicated loyal and voracious cadre of supporters online since then led by its 24 year old digital director kenneth pennington the campaign has sought to expand that online support mr sanders now has more facebook fans than mrs clinton and turn it into volunteers apps and dollars mr pennington and his staff interact daily with supporters on reddit facebook twitter and slack the online chat room software the campaign s senior strategist tad devine said that over the next few days the campaign would roll out six second tumblr ads and send emails and texts to voters it had identified as college students it will also begin a web advertising campaign about the go home for bernie program that uses geographic targeting to reach mobile phones around the colleges if we win this thing he said in large measure it s going to be because these young voters turn out beginning in iowa and also because we can convince the democratic establishment that bernie can be a stronger candidate because of his appeal to young people the way barack obama was in 2008 advertisement
