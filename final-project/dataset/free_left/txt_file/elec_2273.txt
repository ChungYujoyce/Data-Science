hope on the convention floor that argument got personal by julia ioffe july 26 2016 julia ioffe is contributing writer at politico magazine i hope you realize the irony of what she s doing paul czisny a wisconsin delegate for bernie sanders said nodding his head backward at a young woman in the stands a piece of white tape across her mouth that said in stark black letters silenced periodically she stood up and photographers rushed over camera shutters whirring to snap her admittedly very dramatic portrait she s able to vote she s able to get elected as a delegate she s able to come here czisny rolled his eyes he s as pissed off as anyone about the business of the democratic national committee emails it just feeds the frustrations of the bernie people but he was frustrated with people like that young woman unfortunately all they re doing is aiding the trump camp he said virtually no one here meaning the bernie delegates is going to vote for trump but will they stay home will they vote for jill stein of the green party i find this maddening because we ve seen this movie before and if we think bush was a disaster trump will be an even bigger disaster advertisement like the other bernie supporters in the wisconsin delegation he doesn t love hillary clinton but he would do the adult thing and vote for her come november because i m not selfish says 22 year old bernie activist hailey storsved who led the student movement for sanders at her university it s kind of like saying i m taking my ball and going home monday night s democratic national convention felt at times like an unsettled argument a restive sanders contingent looking for opportunities to boo the primary opponent he d been railing against for months and boo everyone she d invited to support her but a big part of the argument was underway within the sanders camp itself how long to hold out against your own party s nominee this is politics after all at what point did principle become a kind of vanity at what point does principle become a kind of vanity i tried to talk to the young woman with the tape over her mouth but she refused to communicate silenced as she was instead she showed me a facebook post she wrote the dnc is threatening that they might pull my credentials if i don t take this off she wrote of her mouth tape her name is angie aker they want to truly silence me they don t even want me to have this much free speech a follow up question about who she was and why she felt silenced resulted in her showing me her screen another facebook post for the media looking for context on my silenced cry for help the establishment wants us to lie for them and say we are behind hillary when it s clear there hasn t even been a fair primary she wrote i m desperate to show somehow it s not true then she ran out of facebook posts to show me and commandeered my notepad to scribble me notes like a modern beethoven everyone has to vote their conscience she wrote echoing ted cruz at last week s republican convention i don t know who i ll vote for but i know i won t cast my vote out of fear anymore 2016 by jeff greenfield we re talking about the political maturation of left wing politics said peter rickman a young man leading the wisconsin delegation a longtime left wing activist and a sanders supporter he was going to get behind clinton rallying fellow bernie ites to her side because as he said we don t need to love hillary but we need to mobilize so that after november we re fighting for a progressive agenda under a clinton white house and not being on the defensive in a proto fascist regime when i asked him about the silenced woman in his delegation he too rolled his eyes at aker he leaned in conspiratorially she runs upworthy he said referring to the social media site soon someone is going to put two and two together that she s just doing this to get personal attention aker actually works in video licensing for the site there was a periodic booing from behind the very polite and very pragmatic wisconsin delegation most of whom seemed at peace with the need to vote for clinton in the fall oh that s not us one of them told me that s new mexico up a few rows was the new mexico delegation which was in the thick of a civil war no never said a young man named rusty pearce a sanders delegate from the state this is a political revolution and a political revolution doesn t just stop we will continue to work to elect progressives up and down the ticket said a freckled middle aged woman named nicole renee peters she also wasn t voting for hillary i m not for hillary and i m not for trump she said defiantly i will never vote for hillary most of their state delegation they both told me confidently was for sanders and felt the same way unfortunately that s not true chimed in an older woman named theresa trujeque standing next to me with a hillary sign the majority is for hillary twenty four delegates out of 43 were for hillary that s with the superdelegates peters and pearce interjected after some squabbling and eye rolling at me can you believe her can you believe these two they agreed that there were 18 delegates for hillary and 16 for bernie they ve been telling us to shut up all day peters complained to me they ve been fighting and booing all day trujeque complained to me they ve been telling us to shut up all day a sanders delegate complained to me they ve been fighting and booing all day a clinton delegate complained to me they don t respect us peters nearly yelled they ve been fighting with the poor delegates with indiana trujeque scolded it s not respectable well i don t find it respectable that hillary clinton lied under oath in the democratic party there s room for disagreement peters insisted instead you re exercising fascism i ve been involved in the democratic party for years and there s no fraud no corruption we take care of everyone some people have never been involved i ve been involved for many years well i ve never seen you that s because i ve lived in new mexico for almost a whole year well then don t try to change us new mexicans the bernie people told me elaborate tales of how the dnc outfoxed and cheated them at every turn and there were very many turns so many we had to keep going over them for clarity until they pointed defiantly to a young man the communications director for the new mexico delegation eyeing them nervously he s going to take our credentials away as soon as this interview is over one of them said it was the first the young man named joe kaburek heard of it we need to do a better job of talking to them he said diplomatically in cleveland a cruz underground refused to concede and get behind the party s nominee and their candidate gave them the satisfaction of a principled last stand he refused to endorse a man they loathed with every fiber of their being in philadelphia the bernie holdouts had no such luck their man endorsed a woman they loathe with every fiber of their being and asked them to vote for her in november instead of getting booed like cruz they were the ones doing the booing they booed lilly ledbetter they booed cory booker and they managed to refrain from booing michelle obama when elizabeth warren spoke the bernie holdouts of michigan sat there in grim anger arms crossed fake birds pinned to their hats they liked warren but didn t like that she was selling out to hillary not for sale some of them yelled they booed lily ledbetter they booed cory booker and they managed to refrain from booing michelle obama when elizabeth warren spoke the bernie hold outs of michigan sat there in grim anger not for sale some of them yelled when bernie emerged on stage they screamed his name and his slogans this is what democracy looks like many of them cried and refused to believe it was over it s not over some of them shouted nooooo others hollered up and down this midwestern section bernie supporters who so reviled superdelegates were praying for them to see the light and switch to bernie s side tuesday thereby annulling the popular vote of the democratic primary which had not been in their favor you never know how many people have turned since wikileaks one michigan delegate told the correspondent of michigan radio she held out hope that tuesday s vote would tilt toward bernie 2016 by susan b glasser and glenn thrush primary source by young il kim 2016 by bill scher are you going to vote for hillary in november the reporter asked her i m voting for bernie tomorrow she said defiantly he asked us to vote for him tomorrow he also asked for you to vote for hillary in november the reporter pressed i m voting for bernie tomorrow nearby a schoolteacher named tammy lewis sat weeping softly we ll never have a chance like this again she said dabbing her dark eyes with a white tissue her husband she said was a nafta victim and she wasn t about to let tpp destroy her family a second time but she was at a loss after bernie s speech he s doing what he has to do she said with a melancholy admiration he knows he has to stop trump he s a good man i m voting for bernie tomorrow that s what i came here to do she said with a quiet sadness would she vote for hillary in the fall as bernie had asked of her maybe she said lost i don t know i know i have to stop trump too but the choice is either i press the pause button or go back in time with trump she rose to leave and wiped her eyes it s not what i wanted she said and left the hall california by jeremy b white updated 05 08 20 09 44
