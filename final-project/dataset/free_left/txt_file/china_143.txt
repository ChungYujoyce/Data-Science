advertisement supported by by jane perlez beijing the trans pacific partnership trade deal was welcomed on tuesday as a win for the united states in its contest with china for clout in asia as america s allies expressed optimism about the impact of the 12 nation accord on a region worried about its dependence on the slowing chinese economy the pact still must win approval in congress and analysts said the economic effects may be less sweeping than washington predicts but the mere fact that president obama delivered on his pledge to close the deal came as a relief to allies in asia it was seen as a counterweight to china s efforts to expand its influence not just in trade but in other areas including its island building in the disputed south china sea and the establishment of a new regional development bank to compete with western led institutions the tpp may not be the game changer the americans say it will be but if the tpp failed it would certainly have been a blow to u s credibility and its conclusion is to be welcomed said bilahari kausikan a former permanent secretary of singapore s foreign ministry yet he cautioned this is not going to erode what china does the victory for the united states comes as china s position in asia has been thrown off balance by questions about the condition of its economy which is expanding at its slowest pace in a quarter century and has sent tremors across the region even with the slowdown though the chinese economy is growing faster than those of most industrial nations and china enjoys deepening economic ties with almost all countries in the region the trade agreement is unlikely to change that but it is an important symbol of america s staying power in asia some experts said it does at least temporarily halt the seemingly inexorable waning of u s influence and the corresponding rise of chinese influence in the asian region said eswar s prasad a professor of international economics at cornell university and former head of the china division at the international monetary fund since 2011 when president obama told the australian parliament that the united states would play a larger and long term role in shaping the asian region its allies have been waiting for results for a while the much extolled pivot to asia seemed to be mostly a verbal one and one intended to antagonize china by proposing to bolster america s military presence and creating a trade zone that kept china out even as washington talked about a new focus on asia china s economic ties with america s friends in the region steadily expanded many asian countries now have trade agreements with china that were completed since the announcement of the pivot and count china as their biggest trading partner australia for example signed a trade agreement with china in june although it has yet to pass through parliament china was seen to be winning in other ways too while its strategic capabilities in east asia did not yet rival those of the united states the financial picture was changing rapidly with china becoming the major lender in the region the inter american dialogue a policy group in washington said in a july report the china development bank and the export import bank of china now provide more loans to the region than the world bank and the asia development bank combined the report said indeed although the tpp is seen mainly as an enterprise that aims to knit the united states and asia closer together three of its 12 members are in latin america chile mexico and peru in terms of trade competition with china in asia the deal would advantage american firms over chinese firms only very slightly since there is very little overlap in the range of goods each country exports to asian members of the accord said nicholas lardy a china expert at the peterson institute for international economics in washington the stakes for the obama administration to conclude the negotiations became higher in asia after the united states defense secretary ashton b carter said in april that the trade pact was as important to me as another aircraft carrier his comments were interpreted as an effort to play down the asia pivot as a predominantly military project an image that some countries worried served to exacerbate an arms race with china in china where the government s initial opposition to the trade pact has softened recently the ministry of commerce issued a statement on tuesday saying that the accord was one of the important free trade agreements in the asia pacific region early in the negotiations beijing criticized the pact as an american effort to contain china an argument that is still frequently heard from chinese analysts initial chinese hostility toward tpp has moderated dramatically mr lardy said but if china contemplated becoming a member as some reform minded chinese economists have suggested the government would need to work harder at economic reform in order to meet the pact s standards mr lardy said in a surprising statement in japan prime minister shinzo abe whose relations with china have been poor suggested china should become a member of the pact if china joined tpp in the future mr abe said it would contribute greatly to our country s security and the stability of the asia pacific region and that would have an extremely large strategic significance but peter drysdale emeritus professor of economics at the australian national university in canberra said it was almost certain that china would stay outside the tpp and therefore work even harder at cementing its economic ties in east asia through other means even with growth two or three percentage points lower than its current rate there s not a major business anywhere in the region including in japan that doesn t have to factor china in mr drysdale said with china out of tpp for the foreseeable future the incentive for china and its east asian partners to ramp up their economic ties will be more powerful australia s prime minister malcolm turnbull greeted the deal with enthusiasm saying it offered unprecedented new opportunities for new markets in asia and latin america as australia faced the end of its mining boom mr turnbull a proponent of close ties with beijing did not mention china in his comments mr abe also hailed the accord saying the curtain is finally rising on a new asian century japan was a latecomer to the negotiations joining only in 2013 and demands by its influential farm lobby that it keep in place tariffs on rice beef milk and other agricultural products proved to be one of several major stumbling blocks mr abe championed the deal against considerable domestic opposition including from many members of his own conservative party large numbers of whom represent rural constituencies but japan s parliament was widely expected to approve the accord although the conclusion of the negotiations were broadly welcomed among america s friends in asia the united states should not view asian nations as wanting to decide between washington and beijing mr kausikan said no one sees the tpp as an alternative to china he said the u s is important and china is important we re capable of doing things simultaneously china is a huge economic factor that cannot be wished away advertisement
