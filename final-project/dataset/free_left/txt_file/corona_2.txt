advertisement supported by learning what hardship has to teach us by david brooks opinion columnist over the past decades a tide of safetyism has crept over american society as greg lukianoff and jonathan haidt put it in their book the coddling of the american mind this is the mentality that whatever doesn t kill you makes you weaker the goal is to eliminate any stress or hardship a child might encounter so he or she won t be wounded by it so we ve seen a wave of overprotective parenting parents have cut back on their children s unsupervised outdoor play because their kids might do something unsafe as kate julian reports in the anxious child and the crisis of modern parenting in the atlantic parents are now more likely to accommodate their child s fears accompanying a 9 year old to the toilet because he s afraid to be alone preparing different food for a child because she won t eat what everyone else eats meanwhile schools ban dodge ball and inflate grades since 2005 the average g p a in affluent high schools has risen from about 2 75 to 3 0 so everybody can feel affirmed it s been a disaster this overprotective impulse doesn t shelter people from fear it makes them unprepared to deal with the fear that inevitably comes suicide rates are way up depression rates have skyrocketed especially for girls as julian notes a staggering number of doctor visits now end with a prescription for an anti anxiety medication like xanax or valium but there has been one sector of american society that has been relatively immune from this culture of overprotection medical training it starts on the undergraduate level while most academic departments slather students with a s science departments insist on mastery of the materials according to one study the average english class g p a is above 3 3 and the average chemistry class g p a is 2 78 while most academic departments have become more forgiving science departments remain rigorous to a fault as much as 60 percent of pre meds never make it through their major med school is intrinsically hard and is sometimes harder than it needs to be but it trains people to work at a very high level amid incredible stress there is tremendous value in knowing they can wake you up in the middle of the night and you can still make a good decision says adina luba kalet director of the kern institute for the transformation of medical education at the medical college of wisconsin med schools also instill a demanding professional ethos which stretches back thousands of years doctors are taught to run into the fire and not away from it kalet continues today the young doctors feel free to say i m terrified but i m going to do it anyway that s courage we re staying we re a team it certainly doesn t always happen but the professional ideal is clear she concludes you can save lives and when you can t save lives you can be in the darkness with patients even if there is nothing to offer you stay med schools are struggling to become more humane and less macho more relationship centered and less body centered but when you look at what s happening across the country right now you see the benefits of their tough training this week the times magazine ran a diary by an e r doctor named helen ouyang to enter the e r with her in this crisis is to enter another world normal procedures crumble under the crush of patients a man dies unattended sitting in a chair a veteran physician feels stripped of his invincibility the core of ouyang s diary is her acceptance that it s impossible to do her work and still stay safe it seems impossible to avoid getting infected death and talk of death is everywhere the virus seems to do whatever it wants we put our full minds and whole hearts into trying to save them then i see their bodies shut down anyway they are alone wearing the same masks for so long etches lines into her face but she keeps going back in there s absolutely no self glorification here just endurance i m reminded of dr albert schweitzer s 1931 memoir when hiring doctors for his hospital in the african jungle he wrote he never hired anyone who thought he was doing something grand and heroic the only doctors who would last are those who thought what they were doing was as ordinary and necessary as doing the dishes there are no heroes of action only heroes of renunciation and suffering i m also reminded of the maxim that excellence is not an action it s a habit tenacity is not a spontaneous flowering of good character it s doing what you were trained to do it manifests not in those whose training spared them hardship but in those whose training embraced hardship and taught students to deal with it i m hoping this moment launches a change in the way we raise and train all our young at all ages i m hoping it exorcises the tide of safetyism which has gone overboard the virus is another reminder that hardship is woven into the warp and woof of existence training a young person is training her or him to master hardship to endure suffering and by building something new from the wreckage redeem it the times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the
