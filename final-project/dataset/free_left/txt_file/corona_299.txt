filed under an emergency edition of this week inelon elon musk welcomes you to meltdown may he is its mascot today musk tweeted he d sell almost all his physical possessions well all right then he tweeted that tesla s share price was too high sending its shares down then he tweeted part of the star spangled banner america s difficult to sing national anthem he encouraged us all to rage rage against the dying of the light of consciousness which somewhat mangles the meter of dylan thomas best known poem he announced his girlfriend the musician grimes was mad at him true may only started today and musk has been melting down all week for instance there was the unhinged ranting on his earnings call about the fascist stay home orders california implemented to slow the coronavirus spread we are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the bay area and that should be identified as a serious risk musk began on the call six bay area counties jointly extended the shelter in place orders affecting tesla s fremont factory through may 31st with only some minor relaxing of restrictions then he went on the expansion of shelter in place or as we call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights is in my opinion breaking people s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong and not why people came to america and built this country what the fuck what the fuck indeed being dangerously wrong about the coronavirus has been something of a musk hobby lately for instance he promoted a dubious paper on chloroquine which was immediately ripped apart the authors were blockchain hucksters not medical researchers on march 6th he called the coronavirus panic dumb on march 14th he said that panic was worse than corona on march 19th he predicted close to zero new cases in us too by end of april more than a million people in the us have been confirmed to have covid 19 as of april 28 this is almost certainly an undercount since these case numbers are artificially constrained by a lack of widespread testing for the illness so musk spent march being wrong about covid 19 okay that s not illegal but securities fraud is ladies and gentlemen my fellow dirtbags and everyone else the sec disrespector has logged on it is not immediately obvious to me whether tweeting that tesla is overpriced is securities fraud because i am not a lawyer so i called some i don t see anything actionable here says evelyn cruz sroufe a partner at perkins coie who specializes in corporate governance for today s tweets to qualify as securities fraud the sec or a plaintiff would have to show that musk would have profited from a drop in the stock price by for instance having a short position or a put this looks instead to be just musk sounding off she says in an email his use of imo also puts his statement into the realm of personal opinion for which there is latitude usually when a company wants to convey to its shareholders that it may be overvalued it does so by providing facts and risk factor says alma angotti a partner and co head of the global investigations and compliance practice at guidehouse who s previously worked in enforcement at the sec among other agencies you give facts so the market can analyze those facts she says there s not a good reason for him to say he thinks it s overvalued that i can think of especially in an informal way according to angotti market manipulation that is when someone takes steps to artificially affect the prices of a security requires only intent he doesn t need to benefit though benefit is often how the government proves intent she says and the sec is already watching him because of his previous actions john reed stark president of john reed stark consulting who previously worked in sec enforcement doesn t see it the same way as agnotti intent is a hard thing to prove stark says greg shill a law professor at the university of iowa told me bluntly that he doesn t know if this counts as securities fraud or not it s uncommon but not necessarily illegal for a public company ceo to essentially call on the market to mark down the value of his company s stock shill says the worst circumstances for musk would be if he were buying shares of tesla or the company were participating in a buyback program says steve diamond a law professor at santa clara university i assume neither is the case diamond says what about that sec settlement and scrutiny though perhaps you recall in the depths of very recent history that on august 7th 2018 musk tweeted am considering taking tesla private at 420 funding secured funding was not in fact secured the sec investigation found musk had a few meetings with saudi arabia s sovereign wealth fund but hadn t discussed a go private transaction in truth and in fact musk had not even discussed much less confirmed key deal terms including price with any potential funding source the sec wrote in its complaint am considering taking tesla private at 420 funding secured anyway they settled and then on february 19th musk tweeted a prediction for the number of model 3s the company would make that wasn t the same as tesla s official guidance one of the provisions of the settlement was that musk have his tweets about tesla pre approved by an in house lawyer and when the agency inquired whether this in house lawyer had approved the february 19th tweets the answer was that musk had not had any of his tweets about tesla pre approved after several weeks of jockeying the two parties came to an agreement musk must have a company lawyer pre approve tweets about tesla s financial health sales or delivery numbers do the meltdown may tweets violate that the wall street journal contacted musk to ask if he was joking or if anyone had vetted his tweet before posting it no musk replied in an email if it was not vetted he s at risk of being hauled into court again by the sec says diamond the process was meant to catch these kinds of tweets before they went out if he did it spontaneously i think he s gonna have an issue jay dubow a partner at pepper hamilton who focuses on white collar litigation thinks the sec is in a tough position on the one hand musk is openly flouting their settlement if he didn t get his tweets approved on the other hand if the sec goes so far as to force musk to dissociate himself from tesla that potentially hurts the shareholders who bought into the stock because they believe in him they re going to have to react and do something dubow says because this was a clear violation of the order and i don t know how they re going to let that go shill also views it as a challenge to the agency it would be prudent for the sec to request confirmation that the settlement agreement was complied with shill told me right now he s arguably delivering to tesla shareholders what they want a really unrestrained unfiltered ceo when you buy tesla that s arguably what you re buying but that s not what the sec settlement says if it is a violation of the settlement agreement tesla is also implicated because the company was meant to control him angotti says tesla s board of directors may be held responsible for musk s actions a trend in corporate governance is making sure the board is accountable for compliance at an organization she tells me if they can t control the ceo they re not ensuring a very good culture of compliance at that company angotti says they can say it all day but if they don t enforce it it doesn t mean anything trying to hold musk accountable may be awkward for the board though tesla has dropped its directors and officers liability insurance it said in an april 28th regulatory filing this policy keeps companies board members and executives from having to pay their own fees for defense settlement or judgement when they face lawsuits instead musk will personally provide coverage substantially equivalent to such a policy for a one year period one more thing while i was working on this story the environmental protection agency got back to us because i guess everyone loves meltdown may so earlier this week musk said on tesla s earnings call that the tesla model s long range should be the first electric vehicle to sport a 400 mile range the epa rating a range of 391 miles happened after someone left the keys in the vehicle and the door open overnight depleting 2 percent of the vehicle s battery musk said on the call we can confirm that epa tested the vehicle properly the door was closed and we are happy to discuss any technical issues with tesla as we do routinely with all automakers an epa spokesperson said in a statement to the verge can t wait to see what other government agencies decide to celebrate meltdown may with us all and if you fear being tangled up in its grips one good way to avoid it is dead simple never tweet
