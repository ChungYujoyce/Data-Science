the following is a transcript of the interview with democratic sen jon testerof montana that aired sunday may 26 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan we want to turn now to montana senator jon tester he is the top democrat on the veterans affairs committee and he joins us this morning from bozeman montana he is also a working farmer which is a unique perspective and i do want to get to you on some of those tariff issues but first off this is of course memorial day weekend there were four veterans suicides at v a facilities in the month of april alone there about 20 a day according to the last tally i saw from last year how is this rate not slowing down senator jon tester well the bottom line is is that we ve got to do more even one suicide is too many margaret and we have a bill senator moran and i do to really kind of take mental health outside the box for the v a to be able to include things like yoga to include things like equine therapy other things that have been proven to be able to work for folks who have mental health issues and it also deals with telehealth for rural areas like my state of montana and other rural states around around this country but the truth is is what we ve done hasn t been enough margaret and we ve got to do more it s why we ve need to get senator moran and my bill across the finish line if we re able to do that it gives the v a some more tools to get more to get more methods out there to be able to to deal with our veterans but we have failed so far there s a no ifs ands or buts about it congress has given the v a i think some good tools to use they need to step it up even greater than before and by the way the other thing that needs to be done is we need to remove the stigma from this so that the people who do have problems do come forward because oftentimes many of these suicides happen and and the v a they haven t they haven t take advantage of the access to v a care margaret brennan all right senator thank you for that i want to ask you though as we mentioned you re a working farmer i think you re the only one in the senate who s actually working the farm himself the president had a 16 billion dollar bailout for farmers this is the third round so far will this make up for the kind of financial losses you re seeing in your home state sen tester it s a band aid there s no doubt about that and there are some folks that are up against the wall way too many folks we re seeing a lot of folks that have been filed for bankruptcy in production agriculture but it is a band aid farmers want to get their check from the marketplace not from the federal government and as a previous person said you know the the fact is the president has created this problem and then he turns around and and writes out a 16 billion dollar check on the taxpayer dime i m not saying it isn t needed it absolutely is needed in a lot of cases where folks are up against it but the truth is is that the reason we have bad commodity prices right now at the farm gate is because we ve got a president who wen tinto a trade war with without a plan without our allies and it ends up where family farm agriculture ends up paying the price and that doesn t help with food security and it certainly doesn t help with our economy margaret brennan senator grassley reportedly will be applying for some of this aid for his family farm will you be tapping into it and apply for it as well sen tester well we ll see how it s going to be divvied up i imagine wheat is going to get part of it and we do raise grains on my place and so we will see but look our place has been hurt by these tariffs just as every other farm has been hurt by these tariffs and we will we will see as it goes but i intend to to take advantage of it because it will help pay the bills margaret brennan how long can farmers go before you see the bankruptcies that you have been predicting sen tester i think we re already starting to see it look i serve on the banking committee too and a lot of the bankers told me a year ago the farmers had about 18 months before we started seeing a real disaster in ag in ag country i think we re already seeing that ag disaster coming around and and the sad part about this it wasn t caused by weather events it wasn t caused because of consolidation in the marketplace and prices were low and inputs were too high what we ve seen is we ve seen a president who s act irresponsibly in the trade he had a plan to hold china accountable but yet didn t know how to implement the plan to hold china accountable and in the end we don t have an end game and and far farmers have been paying the price i ve said this before margaret maybe said it to you before but we should have done this through the financial system we should ve had our allies on board china s been a bad actor but not just the united states to countries all over the world let s bring the world community together and apply pressure instead of just the farmers of the united states of america margaret brennan you gave a speech this week making the case that democrats actually do have a shot at winning back rural america but you said they can t promise things that don t make sense like free college or jobs for everybody have you seen a democratic candidate that fits that description for you sen tester no but i ve seen some policies come out of some democrats that fit that that description and i think it s important that we stay connected with reality college is too high and we need to figure out ways to drive it down but i m not sure that there doesn t need to be skin in the game if you go to college the same thing with healthcare and and one of the proposals that was put out said you re going to have a a a job the job s going to pay livable wages you just can t you just can t do that it s it s not it s not that easy it d be great it s great to say it but it s hard to implement it so i let s stay let s stay grounded in common sense and move forward and i ve seen the candidates by the way across the board that are running for president do do a good job margaret brennan your home state governor is one of them sen tester of staying grounded my home state governor is one of them that is correct yep and so the bottom line is that whoever comes out of this 24 or 25 people who are running for president needs to be able to connect with rural america and you do that by applying common sense margaret brennan are you going to endorse your governor sen tester i m going to be endorsing i will tell you this margaret it s going to happen in the next week and hopefully you ll be the first to know margaret brennan alright thank you very much senator tester we ll be right back with our panel sen tester it was a pleasure
