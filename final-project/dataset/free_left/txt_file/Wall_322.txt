markets it sells short stocks its managers judge to be overvalued and that strategy tends to work better in falling markets in short selling an investor bets that a stock will sink the investor borrows the stock and agrees to sell it to someone else if as hoped the stock does drop it s bought at the lower price and delivered to that buyer that difference minus transaction costs is the short seller s profit if the stock rises the short seller loses as the promised shares still must be bought and delivered greg m swenson a portfolio manager of the grizzly short fund said he and kristen j perleberg who runs the fund with him rank stocks based on a variety of factors including lack of financial discipline and potential for earnings disappointments they short those that rank worst we re looking at the weakest end of the spectrum the most expensive the lowest quality and the lowest growth he said mr swenson said they also use strict rules to decide which bets to abandon they pull out if a stock rises too much typically if it outperforms the market by 20 percent or more or grows to more than 2 percent of the portfolio we like using a quantitative approach because it takes your emotions out of it he said with a typical stock fund holdings shrink as they lose value but in a short fund everything is upside down mr swenson said if a stock is going against us it s getting bigger every day and our losses are compounding the grizzly managers short individual stocks they don t like some competing funds short indexes representing entire sectors even so their short positions have lately clustered among consumer discretionary information technology and industrial shares together those represented about half the portfolio mr swenson cautioned that the fund isn t for everyone it s intended to provide diversification within a broader portfolio especially for investors with lots of exposure to stocks it can help hedge the stocks downside risk anyone pondering investing should understand that if the market goes up 20 percent this fund is going down he said the grizzly fund with an expense ratio of 1 6 percent returned 25 8 percent in the first quarter like short sales long term u s treasury securities tend to thrive during stock market routs when many investors trust the treasury to protect their money the managers of the t rowe price u s treasury long term fund run their offering accordingly emphasizing safety first this fund was established in 1989 said brian j brennan the portfolio manager at the genesis the mission was keep it safe the guidelines have changed very little that means mr brennan and michael k sewell the associate portfolio manager buy only aaa rated government bonds with maturities of 10 years or more eighty five percent of those are u s treasuries or u s treasury inflation protected securities the latter hedge against the possibility of future inflation which eats away the returns on bonds the rest of the portfolio is so called ginnie maes mortgage bonds issued by the government national mortgage association but backed by the u s treasury the fund is a defensive product mr sewell said but we want to make sure when things are looking better portions of the portfolio provide positive total returns in the first quarter with a severe recession looming interest rates dropped stocks mostly sank and long term government bonds soared long treasuries have historically been a great hedge for equity drawdowns like the one we ve recently seen mr sewell said that was spectacularly true in the quarter when the t rowe price fund with a net expense ratio of 0 3 percent returned 21 43 percent advertisement
