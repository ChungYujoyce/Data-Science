watch cbsn live updated on july 10 2019 1 55 pm cbs ap every sentence federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks to congress this week is sure to be parsed by investors who expect and hope the fed will cut interest rates later this month for the first time in a decade powell hinted strongly at a cut in testimony wednesday before the house financial services committee saying since our may meeting however growth and trade crosscurrents have reemerged creating greater uncertainty growth indicators from around the world have disappointed on net raising concerns that weakness in the global economy will continue to affect the u s economy powell continued these concerns may have contributed to the drop in business confidence powell began two days of testimony on wednesday at a time when the economic picture seems mixed the u s job market appears resilient consumer spending and home sales look solid but the economy is likely slowing president donald trump s trade wars have magnified uncertainties and inflation remains chronically below the fed s target level powell and the fed have made clear they ll do whatever they deem appropriate to sustain the economic expansion a message wall street traders have interpreted to mean a coming rate cut indeed when the fed s policymakers met last month they removed from their statement a reference to being patient about interest rates some fed watchers have suggested that cutting rates this month would serve as a kind of insurance policy by the central bank against a potential economic downturn in the fall or early next year powell testified wednesday to the house financial services committee and is set to speak thursday to the senate banking committee as part of the fed s semi annual monetary report to congress committee members wednesday questioned powell about his willingness to cut rates with many democrats pointedly asking about the unusual pressure mr trump has applied to the fed the president has repeatedly accused powell of keeping credit too tight for too long and of thereby holding back the economy and the stock market and the president s counselors maintain that he has the power to fire the chair while claiming that no firing is forthcoming asked tuesday about powell s status white house counselor kellyanne conway told reporters mr trump has made clear his unhappiness with the fed s rate policies and believes he has the power to fire jay powell but he hasn t done that he s not doing that committee chair maxine waters put the issue front and center wednesday asking if the president called you today or tomorrow and said i m firing you pack up it s time to go what would you do of course i would not do that powell replied i can t hear you waters replied eliciting laughter in the hearing room my answer would be no powell said a touch louder and you would not pack up and you would not leave waters pressed no ma am powell said asked if he believed the president had the authority to fire him he said what i ve said is that the law clearly gives me a four year term and i intend to serve it some economists have suggested that if the fed surprises the markets later this month by choosing not to cut rates it might be because powell and other fed policymakers don t want to be seen as having caved to trump s relentless pressure on sunday mr trump asserted that if the fed knew what it was doing it would cut rates that accusation followed his contention friday that the central bank doesn t have a clue and is our most difficult problem investors as tracked by the cme group have assigned a 100 likelihood to a rate cut when the fed meets in three weeks until very recently the chance of a modest quarter point cut was put at 70 and a steep half point cut at 30 the fed s key rate which influences many consumer and business loans now stands in a range of 2 25 to 2 5 investors still see a 100 likelihood of a rate cut this month but nearly all now foresee only a quarter point move that change reflects two developments first mr trump and chinese president xi jinping declared a truce last month in what had threatened to become an escalating u s china trade war and agreed to resume talks toward a deal that would meet the administration s demands to better protect u s technology that step eased fears that mr trump would extend punitive tariffs to an additional 300 billion in chinese goods in the process inviting retaliation from beijing on american exports and likely weakening both nations economies second after a tepid job gain in may u s employers sharply stepped up their hiring in june an indication of the economy s durability despite the trade pressures however as powell noted wednesday crosscurrents concerning trade policies and global growth have reared their head apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty and our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments his testimony stated growth indicators from around the world have disappointed on net raising concerns that weakness in the global economy will continue to affect the u s economy cbs news irina ivanova contributed to this report
