 former hillary clinton aides have blasted sen bernie sanders for everything from his policy record to his campaign kickoff speech to the composition of his small dollar donors nam y huh ap photo 2020 elections former hillary clinton aides and allies are scrutinizing bernie s flaws and vulnerabilities much as he once did to her by holly otterbein 03 05 2019 05 01 am est updated 03 05 2019 07 13 am est bernie sanders and hillary clinton formally made peace at a new hampshire unity event in july 2016 where the two rivals sought to put the acrimonious democratic primary behind them clinton staffers however weren t party to that agreement and now that sanders is embarking on a second run for president they re making their true feelings about the vermont senator known advertisement both on the record and on background on twitter and on cable television clinton s former aides and allies are taking pains to lay out what they see as all of sanders s flaws imperfections and vulnerabilities much as he once did to their ex boss during a primary that saw mud flying on both sides i would say and for all i know the sanders people might take this as a compliment among a lot of the major donors in the party there s concern that he could emerge said david brock a longtime clinton ally who founded a pro clinton super pac in the 2016 campaign and later authored a public apology to sanders for some of his bare knuckled criticisms during the primary there are some very dyed in the wool democrats that wouldn t at all be enthusiastic about supporting him in a general election brock said sanders would be hard pressed to unite the different wings of the democratic party and his ability to raise vast sums of money through small donations could ultimately result in him staying in the race past the point when he can win which is not necessarily good for the eventual nominee and therefore could be helpful for president trump the race for 2020 starts now stay in the know

mathematical chance of winning the party nomination jeff weaver a top adviser to sanders shot back that sanders grassroots army of supporters could make him the nominee and dismissed the notion that the absence of large donors would hurt him in a general election it is not a secret that people who would hang out with david brock would be putting their class interests ahead of the party and the country he said we have got to nominate somebody who is going to energize and excite the grassroots not a handful of billionaires in recent weeks former clinton aides have blasted sanders for everything from his policy record to his campaign kickoff speech to the composition of his small dollar donors the attacks come as sanders is in the midst of a successful rollout raising 10 million less than a week into his 2020 candidacy and attracting a combined 25 000 plus people to his first two kickoff rallies when sanders pulled in 1 million in the first three and a half hours of his campaign adam parkhomenko the former director of grassroots engagement for the 2016 clinton campaign tweeted only half were named vladimir in a february op ed for nbc zac petkanas the director of rapid response for clinton s 2016 campaign slammed sanders past positions on gun control immigration and same sex marriage and after sanders first rally this weekend former clinton campaign aide zerlina maxwell claimed on msnbc that sanders did not mention race or gender until 23 minutes into his speech she later walked backed her comments somewhat after critics including former sanders campaign staffer waleed shahid noted that sanders talked about racism and sexism much earlier in the event by david cohen sanders all too aware of the knock from clinton s supporters in 2016 that his fans were abusive online has sought to encourage party unity he sent an email to more than 100 surrogates last month calling on them to engage respectfully with other democratic contenders in 2020 as we engage with our opponents in the democratic primary we will forcefully present our views and defend ourselves against misrepresentations he said but let us do our very best to engage respectfully with our democratic opponents talking about the issues we are fighting for not about personalities or past grievances i want to be clear that i condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space still sanders doesn t pretend he and clinton are pals when he was asked last week on the view whether he would seek advice from clinton as other 2020 contenders have there was no artifice in his answer i suspect not he said hillary and i have fundamental differences his answer didn t go over well with clinton allies who viewed it as a poke in the eye i don t know who our nominee is going to be but i am damn sure that beating trump getting america back on the right footing is going to require a unified democratic party so crap like this 613 days before election day is irresponsible counter productive sets us all back tweeted clinton spokesman nick merrill brock said the major party donors were concerned about sanders for two reasons electability and a difference in ideology as a self described democratic socialist that s just a step too far for a lot of people adding they worry that he would end up losing to trump hillary clinton and bernie sanders ultimately attempted to work together during the 2016 general election season but grudges remain jewel samad afp getty images perhaps the biggest attack launched by ex clinton staffers so far came recently in politico where a number portrayed him in unflattering terms for using private jets while campaigning for clinton after she won the democratic nomination while sanders team contends the senator kept to a rigorous schedule of 39 rallies in 13 states in the homestretch of the 2016 campaign the argument isn t convincing in some pro clinton quarters i m not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop donald trump his royal majesty king bernie sanders would only deign to leave his plush d c office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe petkanas said neera tanden a longtime clinton policy advisor was less evocative but no less pointed in a response to a recent sanders radio interview where he said we have got to look at candidates you know not by the color of their skin not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age at a time where folks feel under attack because of who they are saying race or gender or sexual orientation or identity doesn t matter is not off she tweeted it s simply wrong in the event that sanders doesn t win the democratic nomination in 2020 he has repeatedly promised to campaign for the person who does 2020 elections by holly otterbein i look forward to winning the nomination if i don t i will support anybody else who s out there to defeat trump he said in an interview on the breakfast club this guy cannot win another term in the meantime weaver warned broadsides from people like brock are likely to backfire the campaign in 2016 never did better than when we were being attacked by the likes of david brock and allied parts of the party he said they were great for increasing our crowds great for increasing our fundraising and great for increasing our votes former pennsylvania gov ed rendell a staunch clinton supporter expects that by november 2020 any bad blood between clinton and sanders forces will be sublimated in the all out effort to oust donald trump from the white house i think the desire among democrats of every stripe of every ideology whoever they supported in the past their desire to defeat trump is so strong that they ll unify behind whoever the nominee is he said they would vote for you for president they would vote for me for president missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020 politico llc
