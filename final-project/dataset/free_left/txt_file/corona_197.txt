 in just a few weeks the novel coronavirus outbreak has changed the way thousands of companies operate in an unprecedented manner as business owners and employees navigate the new normal here are some of the ways they have adapted to stay operating amid a global pandemic the covid 19 outbreak has delivered an indiscriminate blow to businesses as everything from small restaurants to multinational corporations have been forced to change how they do work amid a series of shutdown orders to help stem the tide of the virus they have also had to implement these massive organizational changes in just a matter of weeks to attempt to stay afloat with many companies shifting to full scale working from home plans and others going all in on delivery i ve done a couple of webinars with groups of companies as of about a week and a half ago they weren t doing anything there wasn t anything different peter cappelli a professor of management at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania and the director of wharton s center for human resources told abc news while many companies have adapted to the new realities of a pandemic economy cappelli predicts the big test will come when it goes on for more than a couple of weeks some industries like airlines have not been able to find their footing as ridership has plummeted amid the crisis leading them to project massive losses and millions of workers have already filed for unemployment even as companies scramble to hire workers to accommodate the new realities of the socially distanced and increasingly delivery economy right now i think companies are getting a lot out of the good citizenship of their employees he added moreover in recent months cappelli said there has been a shift in the way employers regard their workers and it has been in vogue for business leaders to refer to employees as stakeholders not just workers cappelli predicts this health crisis is one of the first obstacles to put that to the test so far we ve seen more companies carrying employees for longer than expected if this had been a financial downturn versus a health related one he said social distancing measures and government mandated stay in place orders have led to entire companies moving their workforce to working from home leading to a skyrocketing demand for video conferencing software such as zoom the world is not going to be the same as it was in december janine pelosi zoom s chief marketing officer told abc news where that levels out none of us really know but working remotely and using video conferencing is not going to go away if anything i think it will speed up the adoption of these technologies in addition to being used for meetings workers in the health and fitness sector have also used the software to stream live

mitzvahs in the aftermath of many shelter in place ordinances the same new directives that are forcing thousands to work from home have led to a sharp uptick in demand for delivery services especially

are hiring hundreds of thousands of workers while other companies are facing mass lay offs instacart announced late last week it plans to hire a whopping 300 000 additional full time shoppers over the
