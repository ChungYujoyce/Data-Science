advertisement supported by while dr anthony fauci has urged caution in using hydroxychloroquine some doctors are prescribing it to patients who have the virus despite the fact it has never been tested for it by peter baker katie rogers david enrich and maggie haberman washington president trump made a rare appearance in the situation room on sunday as his pandemic task force was meeting determined to talk about the anti malaria medicine that he has aggressively promoted lately as a treatment for the coronavirus once again according to a person briefed on the session the experts warned against overselling a drug yet to be proved a safe remedy particularly for heart patients yes the heart stuff mr trump acknowledged then he headed out to the cameras to promote it anyway so what do i know he conceded to reporters at his daily briefing i m not a doctor but i have common sense day after day the salesman turned president has encouraged coronavirus patients to try hydroxychloroquine with all of the enthusiasm of a real estate developer the passing reference he makes to the possible dangers is usually overwhelmed by the full throated endorsement what do you have to lose he asked five times on sunday bolstered by his trade adviser a television doctor larry ellison of oracle and rudolph w giuliani a former new york mayor mr trump has seized on the drug as a miracle cure for the virus that has killed thousands and paralyzed american life along the way he has prompted an international debate about a drug that many doctors in new york and elsewhere have been trying in desperation even without conclusive scientific studies mr trump may ultimately be right and physicians report anecdotal evidence that has provided hope but it remains far from certain and the president s assertiveness in pressing the case over the advice of advisers like dr anthony s fauci the government s top infectious disease specialist has driven a wedge inside his coronavirus task force and has raised questions about his motives if hydroxychloroquine becomes an accepted treatment several pharmaceutical companies stand to profit including shareholders and senior executives with connections to the president mr trump himself has a small personal financial interest in sanofi the french drugmaker that makes plaquenil the brand name version of hydroxychloroquine i certainly understand why the president is pushing it said dr joshua rosenberg a critical care doctor at brooklyn hospital center he s the president of the united states he has to project hope and when you are in a situation without hope things go very badly so i m not faulting him for pushing it even if there isn t a lot of science behind it because it is at this point the best most available option for use a senior physician at wyckoff heights medical center in brooklyn where doctors are not providing the drug however said the current demand was worrisome for patients on it chronically for rheumatic diseases at st barnabas hospital in the bronx another doctor said his staff was giving it to coronavirus patients but criticized the president and gov andrew m cuomo for cheerleading the drug without proof false hope can be bad too he said the professional organization that published a positive french study cited by mr trump s allies changed its mind in recent days the international society of antimicrobial chemotherapy said the article does not meet the society s expected standard some hospitals in sweden stopped providing hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus after reports of adverse side effects according to swedish news media but mr cuomo told reporters on monday that he would ask mr trump to increase the federal supply of hydroxychloroquine to new york pharmacies allowing the state to lift a limit on purchases there has been anecdotal evidence that it is promising mr cuomo said while noting the lack of a formal study mr trump first expressed interest in hydroxychloroquine a few weeks ago telling associates that mr ellison a billionaire and a founder of oracle had discussed it with him at the time dr mehmet oz the host of television s the doctor oz show was in touch with mr trump s advisers about expediting approval to use the drug for the coronavirus mr giuliani has urged mr trump to embrace the drug based in part on the advice of dr vladimir zelenko a self described simple country doctor who has become a hit on conservative media after administering a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine the antibiotic azithromycin and zinc sulfate in an interview on monday mr giuliani denied any financial stake and said he spoke with mr trump only after the president had already promoted the drug publicly mr giuliani said he turned to the issue after researching former vice president joseph r biden jr in ukraine a project that led to the president s impeachment when i finished biden i immediately switched to coronavirus and i have been doing an enormous amount of research on it he said as it happened dr zelenko was born in ukraine and when they first spoke mr giuliani accidentally called him dr zelensky mixing up his name with ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky mr giuliani said he brought a prosecutor s experience to his research one of the things that a good litigator becomes is you kind of become an instant expert on stuff and then you forget about it he said i don t claim to be a doctor i just repeat what they said the food and drug administration which has approved hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for malaria and lupus issued an emergency order late last month allowing doctors to administer it to coronavirus patients if they saw fit mr trump said the federal government would distribute 29 million doses and that he had called prime minister narendra modi of india requesting more dr fauci made his concern clear last week i think we ve got to be careful that we don t make that majestic leap to assume that this is a knockout drug he said on friday on fox news we still need to do the kinds of studies that definitively prove whether any intervention not just this one any intervention is truly safe and effective the same day laura ingraham a fox host visited mr trump at the white house with two doctors who had been on her program promoting hydroxychloroquine one of whom made a presentation on its virtues according to an official confirming a washington post report the next day peter navarro the president s trade adviser who has been assigned to expedite production of medical equipment and become an advocate of the drug upbraided dr fauci at a white house task force meeting according to people informed about the discussion mr navarro arrived at the meeting armed with a thick sheaf of papers recounting research when the issue was raised according to a person informed about the meeting confirming a report by axios mr navarro picked it up off a chair dropped it on the table and started handing out copies mr navarro who earned a doctorate in economics from harvard defended his position on monday despite his lack of medical credentials doctors disagree about things all the time my qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that i m a social scientist he said on cnn i have a ph d and i understand how to read statistical studies whether it s in medicine the law economics or whatever mr trump made clear on sunday whose side he took in mr navarro s confrontation with dr fauci at his briefing after the meeting he said it was wrong to wait for the kind of study dr fauci wanted we don t have time the president said we don t have two hours because there are people dying right now some associates of mr trump s have financial interests in the issue sanofi s largest shareholders include fisher asset management the investment company run by ken fisher a major donor to republicans including mr trump a spokesman for mr fisher declined to comment another investor in both sanofi and mylan another pharmaceutical firm is invesco the fund previously run by wilbur ross the commerce secretary mr ross said in a statement monday that he was not aware that invesco has any investments in companies producing the drug nor do i have any involvement in the decision to explore this as a treatment as of last year mr trump reported that his three family trusts each had investments in a dodge cox

fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing
