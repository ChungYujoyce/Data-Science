advertisement supported by by peter baker washington not that he s competitive or anything but one friday evening john d podesta a top adviser to president obama announced at a white house meeting that he would finish a 10 mile race that weekend in so many minutes needling denis mcdonough the president s chief of staff mr podesta added i don t know what denis is going to run sure enough mr podesta finished in an hour and 26 minutes beating mr mcdonough 21 years his junior by six minutes so as mr podesta 66 packed up his west wing office last week he jokingly blamed his departure on a subsequent loss i knew it was time to look at leaving the white house when denis mcdonough beat me in 12k jingle bell race he said on twitter wiry ascetic profane and relentless john podesta has become the democratic party s marathon man in more ways than one he helped save bill clinton s presidency from the fires of scandal and impeachment he spent the last year trying to salvage barack obama s presidency from gridlock and malaise and now he has handed in his white house pass to try to create a hillary rodham clinton presidency from the ashes of her last failed campaign perhaps no other unelected democrat has shaped his party as much over the last two decades as mr clinton s chief of staff as founder of the left leaning center for american progress and most recently as mr obama s counselor mr podesta has pushed his party toward a more aggressive approach to both policy and politics he s a competitive cat mr mcdonough said mr podesta will need that competitive streak if he becomes chairman of mrs clinton s presidential campaign as expected it will fall to him to impose discipline on the sprawling and fractious clinton universe including the candidate and her famously undisciplined husband and it will fall to mr podesta to manage relations between a president focusing on his legacy and his would be successor focusing on the next election he believes in and uses power in a way that many democrats are too pusillanimous to do said paul begala a former clinton white house aide and longtime friend he s not afraid to use power and ruthlessly if necessary i think he s as good a political guy as i ve ever seen he s the real thing to many democrats last week s blowup over fund raising practices in the clinton orbit emphasized the need for adult supervision recalling the internal strife that helped doom mrs clinton s primary bid against mr obama seven years ago her 2008 campaign was riven by clashing rivals more intent on fighting each other than opposing candidates for months no single aide was truly in charge in recruiting mr podesta mrs clinton is signaling that she will impose a more orderly structure this time when john speaks both longtime clinton supporters like me and people new to the circle will know that he s speaking for her said harold ickes a top adviser to both clintons for years that s very important that didn t happen in 2008 with some of the resulting consequences no one doubts mr podesta s toughness during his previous white house stint colleagues joked that he was sometimes replaced by his evil twin skippy and as someone who met mr clinton during joseph d duffey s unsuccessful senate campaign in connecticut in 1970 he is one of the few people with the longevity and stature to talk bluntly with the clintons when they mess up the fact that he s saying it would carry an enormous amount of weight mr ickes said both of them consider him a very straight shooter republican operatives view mr podesta as a liberal who will tug mrs clinton away from the political center and make it harder for her to argue that she represents a fresh start after mr obama s administration you ve got to admire someone willing to move from one sinking ship to another that s taking on water before it s even left port said michael short a spokesman for the republican national committee voters overwhelmingly don t want a third term for president obama s liberal agenda but it s clear that s what hillary clinton and john podesta intend to give them mr podesta who declined to be interviewed because he is superstitious about profiles was born in chicago to an italian american father and greek american mother his father never finished high school and worked in factories pushing his children to go to college while mr podesta is a practicing catholic like his father he embraces his mother s side as well displaying greek orthodox icons in his white house office and adopting her love of cooking he has attributed his drive and temper to an ethnic upbringing during which yelling at the dinner table over politics was acceptable he came of age in the tumult of the 1960s while studying at knox college in illinois he and other students debated ranted chanted protested as he put it in a 1998 commencement address and he campaigned for eugene mccarthy the antiwar presidential candidate in 1968 mr podesta earned a law degree from georgetown university where he still teaches on the side and went to work for figures like senators patrick j leahy of vermont and tom daschle of south dakota with his brother tony podesta he founded the podesta group which has become a powerhouse lobbying firm with extensive corporate ties after going to work for mr clinton he rose to chief of staff presiding over a white house rocked by revelations about the president s sexual adventures with monica lewinsky to keep the staff focused on business he threatened to fire anyone caught talking about the scandal but he understood before colleagues did that they would lose a house vote on impeachment despite popular support for mr clinton and he oversaw a strategy emphasizing the partisanship of the process to delegitimize the house vote and win a largely party line acquittal in the senate after leaving the white house mr podesta founded the center for american progress an organization that married policy and politics he s a policy wonk s policy wonk said sarah rosen wartell a co founder who added he was also very much a doer enlisting wealthy donors like george soros and herb and marion sandler mr podesta made the center and himself power players in liberal politics in 2008 mr obama tapped mr podesta to run his transition to the chagrin of the loyalists who had helped beat mrs clinton for the nomination mr obama tried to recruit him to join the administration an entreaty he resisted until early 2014 when the presidency was flailing and he agreed to come on board for a year to help turn it around donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention mr podesta came with a strategy he and ms wartell had outlined in a 2010 report about how a president could use his executive authority more aggressively without waiting for congress he also took on select projects notably climate change and privacy in a big data world for mr mcdonough the chief of staff now occupying the corner office with the patio and the fireplace that once belonged to mr podesta having a predecessor around a guy who s seen it all proved a benefit john is always thinking a couple steps ahead mr mcdonough said passionate about environmental issues mr podesta used his perch to help advance new regulations on power plants negotiate a carbon reduction agreement with china create the world s largest marine refuge in the pacific ocean and protect stretches of alaskan watersand wildlife refuge from drilling it s not clear to me he slept said carol m browner formerly mr obama s top environmental adviser in a series of twitter posts on friday listing his 10 favorite memories in the obama white house he devoted half to environmental issues a longtime aficionado of extraterrestrial lore he kept a little shrine to the x files in his clinton white house office he also wrote that my biggest failure of 2014 once again not securing the disclosure of the ufo files thetruthisstilloutthere if he cannot find proof of alien life then he will test the maxim that a two term president and his party s next nominee always end up at odds al gore did not want mr clinton campaigning for him in 2000 just as senator john mccain did not want george w bush campaigning for him in 2008 mr podesta may serve as a bridge between mr obama and mrs clinton hoping to ease the natural frictions that arise as a candidate tries to distinguish herself from a president with improving but still mediocre poll numbers he has played the role before he negotiated on mr obama s behalf an agreement with mr clinton to limit his international activities while mrs clinton served as secretary of state and later when mr clinton went to north korea to free two americans the white house sent mr podesta along to keep tabs for the next two years as he races another marathon as mrs clinton s top adviser mr podesta will have the advantage of the relationship he forged with mr mcdonough mr obama s top adviser he s a great runner mr mcdonough said the guy s made me much better at everything i do in this job and he s made me a better runner too advertisement
