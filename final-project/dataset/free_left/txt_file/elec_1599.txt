 2016 the speaker did not expect trump to clinch the nomination so soon and huddled quickly with advisers to plot his break by jake sherman 05 05 2016 07 07 pm edt updated 05 05 2016 08 29 pm edt house speaker paul ryan never expected donald trump to lock up the nomination so quickly getty on wednesday morning not even 24 hours after donald trump effectively clinched the republican nomination paul ryan convened his top advisers for a call with congress out of session ryan was bouncing between multiple states raising the piles of money needed to keep house republicans in the majority but donald trump was on his mind the speaker could not at least at this point support him and he wanted to talk through how to proceed advertisement ryan never expected trump to lock up the nomination so quickly he didn t think texas sen ted cruz would drop out of the race in may in fact ryan s orbit was preparing for a contested convention in cleveland where he is slated to serve as chairman effectively the emcee of the trump coronation the decision was made quickly the next day he would go on cnn and make it official in no uncertain terms i think what a lot of republicans want to see is that we have a standard bearer that bears our standards he told jake tapper in the bombshell interview that was taped shortly before it aired on thursday afternoon i think conservatives want to know does he share our values and our principles on limited government the proper role of the executive adherence to the constitution ryan added there are lots of questions that conservatives i think are gonna want answers to myself included i want to be a part of this unifying process i want to help to unify this party ryan pre taped the interview and didn t watch it live he was at a campaign rally with wisconsin sen ron johnson ryan gave gop chairman and fellow wisconsinite reince priebus a heads up before it aired trump s campaign was stunned by ryan s interview earlier on thursday campaign sources said advisers to the candidate had reached out to ryan s office with an invitation would the speaker be able to meet with trump for a one on one meeting to discuss the fall campaign and the party s agenda the invitation was passed on to a staffer and the campaign didn t hear back immediately from ryan s office the next thing the trump campaign knew there was ryan on national tv what just happened aides asked they got in touch with ryan s office the invitation was off the table the campaign sources said who believe ryan hadn t received word of the offer to meet personally with trump by the time the speaker went on tv an aide to ryan responded that there was no offer for a one on one meeting there was chatter about a staff level discussion the person said and a meeting between trump and a large group of house republicans both were being brokered by sen jeff sessions r ala a prominent trump backer ryan the aide added is happy to meet with trump trump responded to ryan hours after the interview i am not ready to support speaker ryan s agenda perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the american people he said in a statement they have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first by hanna trudo now the ryan trump relationship will take center stage in a way few ever expected ryan s decision will likely force trump to come to capitol hill and prove his mettle trump s team thursday was already trying to set up meetings in washington and ryan s orbit would welcome an audience with the party s presumptive nominee for the past four months as trump soared in the polls ryan has watched warily a ban on muslims in the u s that s not what this country is about he said a hesitance to disavow white supremacists really trump even blasted free trade agreements pacts that ryan strongly supports but after repeating the standard line for months that he would support the party s nominee the country s highest ranking republican could not bring himself to do so once trump actually became that person and so in the most searing and drastic defection of this wild campaign season ryan broke ranks with the brash new york billionaire the decision will shape ryan s political future in the short and long term and could have a real effect on the outcome of the 2016 election immediately the move could give the 200 plus republicans up for reelection particularly those in the swing districts that will decide the size of the gop s majority or even whether it keeps the house a measure of cover from trump s unpopularity many of them think the presumptive nominee is too politically crude to represent the party ryan s move came just hours after trump tweeted i love hispanics along with a picture of him eating a taco bowl not exactly the kind of fence mending with a growing voting bloc that gop brass had in mind for trump s general election pivot but ryan s decision to buck the nominee in waiting was borne out of opposition to trump s principles not any particular policy according to a source familiar with his thinking of course much will be read into this decision ryan has ruled out launching a white knight bid for president this year and giving trump the stiff arm isn t likely to change that calculus but the speaker has acknowledged that a bid in 2020 is possible and intentional or not this could be part of an effort to pick up the pieces if republicans lose the white house this fall history dept by josh zeitz ryan s break from trump contrasted sharply with mitch mcconnell s more muddled positioning on the party s standard bearer i have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by republican voters and donald trump the presumptive nominee is now on the verge of clinching that nomination the senate majority leader said in a written statement wednesday night ryan is also preparing to roll out a separate governing agenda for the fall that his members can run on a clear sign that he thinks the substance of the 2016 contest does not represent the party he has spent 20 years trying to build the future of america is on the line no one should support hillary clinton let s make that clear ryan told cnn to be the party and climb the final hill and win we need a standard bearer that can unify all conservatives and the wings of the party and then go to the country with an appealing agenda that s appealing to the democrats we have work to do on the front the nominee has to lead in that effort alex isenstadt contributed to this report missing out on the
