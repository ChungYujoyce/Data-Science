 strategists have raised questions about whether the paper s approval can do much to influence voters and could even be counterproductive by kyle cheney 01 23 2016 07 57 am est updated 01 24 2016 01

rubio on saturday won the endorsement of the des moines register the most prominent daily newspaper in iowa with just over a week until voters caucus on feb 1 and begin the process of selecting their parties presidential nominees in the dual editorials the paper said democratic voters had one outstanding candidate deserving of their support citing clinton s depth of knowledge and experience and her ability to work across party lines as a new york senator while stating that the whip smart rubio could chart a new direction for the gop advertisement the paper s editorial board acknowledged that clinton is not a perfect candidate detailing her email furor and changing stances on gay marriage and immigration but it argued she is much more qualified than both bernie sanders and martin o malley of rubio the paper argued that he still faces questions over his experience and ability to unite the party but that he could offer above other gop contenders an uplifting message of a new american century both campaigns quickly blasted out the respective editorials in emails to their supporters but strategists and observers have raised questions about whether the paper s approval can do much to influence voters and in some cases could even be counterproductive the register has been endorsing candidates ahead of iowa s presidential caucuses since 1988 but this cycle s blessings came amid an upside down political atmosphere in which once vaunted traditions have become unwelcome reminders of insiderdom the two republican candidates likeliest to win the caucuses donald trump and ted cruz didn t even bother to court the paper s endorsement and it s unclear whether they would ve have wanted it anyway republican strategists and political observers predicted that unlike in previous years a register endorsement is an instant talking point for rivals proof that the winners are aligned with a mainstream media outlet s moderate to liberal lean the register s endorsement is like being endorsed by the washington post or ny times if you re a conservative argued former republican national committee chairman michael steele for trump and cruz it will give them a chance to sound off to diminish any potential positive impact the endorsement could have against the establishment endorsing one of their own in short it s like a car accident move along nothing to see here david yepsen who covered politics for the register for 34 years also predicted that the republican endorsement could backfire i think it will become a point to needle said yepsen see we told you he was too liberal off message the biggest benefit from an endorsement would likely occur outside of iowa argued one veteran iowa republican strategist for rubio who is seeking to run as an establishment oriented alternative to trump or cruz the endorsement could signal to voters in new hampshire and more moderate enclaves that establishment republicans are coalescing behind him the endorsement enables him to say i m the establishment pick and yeah that s going to be really valuable the strategist said that campaign is going to try to use it to say look at me east coasters this is the beginning of the meshing of the establishment behind me the democratic endorsement yepsen noted may be more influential since the paper s left leaning editorial board tends to connect better with democrats the register he added would have been hard pressed to ditch clinton whom it backed over then sen barack obama in late 2007 the paper that year described her readiness to lead the country we believe as president she ll do what she s always done in her life throw herself into the job and work hard the board wrote we believe hillary rodham clinton can do great things for our country if sanders wins it probably turns this story upside down since that would be a big surprise clinton won the endorsement yepsen noted even though the paper s editorial board has almost entirely turned over since her last campaign the register s saturday endorsements were its 10th and 11th since it first backed democrat paul simon in 1988 they come in a year that has already featured outright hostility toward mainstream media institutions cruz for example has warred with the wall street journal editorial board long a paragon of conservativism trump on thursday was targeted by conservative writers at national review prompting trump to lash out in response trump has fought too with the register itself the paper wrote an editorial last year slamming trump for sexist comments in response trump s campaign denied press credentials to the register for covering local events marco rubio is polling in iowa behind donald trump and ted cruz ap photo these days candidates can afford to do battle with prominent outlets in previous caucus years endorsements were more meaningful because candidates didn t have 24 7 exposure and a trusted editorial board was an important liaison to voters argued ari fleischer a former press secretary to president george w bush today they re only good for a positive news cycle or two endorsements are like fool s gold he said you can spend them the day they come out to get good press but they don t change voter behavior in the meantime he said the recipients rivals will be working to spin the endorsement as a negative especially on the republican side with the dislike of all things establishment this cycle kevin madden a spokesman for mitt romney s 2012 presidential campaign said it s a particularly difficult year for newspaper endorsements to make an impact editorial endorsements are more of a conventional barometer of support or progress in a totally unconventional year he said it s less about being blessed by the hands of the establishment and more about their diminished ability due to a much more fractured media landscape to drive earned media attention and shape voter attitudes by eliza collins over the years the paper has had mediocre luck at picking winners and former new york times data expert nate silver noted in 2011 that there s little evidence candidates even received a statistical benefit from the endorsement that year the paper endorsed romney who lost the republican caucuses narrowly to rick santorum but ultimately became the party s nominee but few see the needle moving much regardless of the register s decisions in general i just think newspaper endorsements are kind of an antiquity yepsen said what it s worth is a little media buzz the media writes about itself and the race kind of moves on missing out on the
