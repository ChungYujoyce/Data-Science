advertisement supported by news analysis by michael barbaro des moines fury carried ted cruz to victory and it stopped hillary clinton from truly claiming one the vote here in iowa was a portrait of red hot america so disaffected that it turned to a pugilistic evangelical republican who calls for demolition of a system saturated with corruption and it sent a forceful message to democratic leaders that it was unwilling to put aside its resentment of wall street and corporate america to crown a lifelong party insider who has amassed millions in speaking fees from the big banks monday night s results confirmed that despite the widening cultural and political fissures that have divided right and left voters are united in an impatience even a revulsion at what they see as a rigged system that no longer works for them for republicans the enemy is an overreaching government strangling their freedoms and pocketbooks for democrats it is an unfair economy shrinking their paychecks and aspirations this is the most anxious electorate we ve seen in a very long time said david gergen an adviser to four presidents of both parties mr cruz s triumph on monday combined with senator bernie sanders s effective tie with mrs clinton demonstrated how bipartisan the bitterness has become it s striking mr gergen said that the winner of the republican side represents the far right and the moral winner for the democrats comes from the far left it s a clear vote of no confidence in the economic order in many ways the focus of the 2016 campaign has turned to easing the palpable frustrations of a large portion of white working class americans who believe that the country no longer works for them now both parties are reacting sometimes clumsily to the indignation and insecurities of those voters buffeted by financial stagnation globalization and technological and demographic change from the start an uncomfortable question has hovered over this race in a country where increasingly everybody is a statistical minority who exactly speaks for the white working class mrs clinton has stumbled as she has sought to champion such voters as if putting on populist clothes that do not quite fit despite the advantages of financial muscle and establishment organization she failed to convince enough of the insecure electorate that she was truly on their side on monday night a disappointed looking ms clinton raised her voice to a near yell as she tried to demonstrate her own conviction but she offered oddly little direct assuagement to the unsettled working class that still craves her assurance that task fell instead as it has throughout the campaign to mr sanders mrs clinton s ultraliberal rival whose denunciations of greedy plutocrats and an unfair economy are at the center of his message given the enormous crisis facing our country he said here after voting had concluded it is just too late for establishment politicians and establishment economics on the republican side mr cruz has sought to cast himself as the savior of the disaffected working class denouncing a washington cartel that vows radical reform on their behalf but then makes treacherous concessions in the name of cooperation and comity and his expressions of religiosity have allowed him to bond with working class voters who might otherwise be wary of his ivy league pedigree and washington career but his credibility as anticorporate crusader is in doubt his wife is an executive at goldman sachs and he relied on a hefty loan from the bank to pay for the campaign that propelled him into the senate yet on monday mr cruz was just persuasive enough overtaking his colorful red cap wearing rival donald j trump whose entire candidacy was built around class rage and a promise to bring wealth and success back to the downtrodden surveys of voters who turned out for the iowa caucuses showed that 40 percent of republicans described themselves as angry and they split their vote between mr cruz and mr trump in his victory speech mr cruz characterized this win as a victory for the overlooked and undervalued those who shouldered the burden of seven years of washington deals run amok fittingly the two are worlds apart on almost every issue she is for abortion rights he is firmly opposed to them she wants to expand health care he wants to blow up the affordable care act she wants to raise taxes on the rich he wants to impose a flat tax that would lower them she is an eager supporter of gay marriage he views its legalization as an infringement on religious liberty but both confront the same furious national mood and the challenge of turning alienation and rage into organized support and election day votes over the coming months without going too far of course iowa is not representative of the entire country its quirks and attitudes may not be replicated everywhere but it is difficult to overstate how avidly large segments of americans now wish to see the depth of their outrage and their hunger for deep seated reform embodied in their presidential candidates it s totally understandable said steve schmidt a longtime republican strategist who advised john mccain s 2008 presidential campaign across the depth and breadth of american society he said nothing seems to be working advertisement
