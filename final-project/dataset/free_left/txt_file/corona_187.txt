the organization s director general still he cautioned that the outbreak could worsen does this virus have pandemic potential he said absolutely it has new pessimistic forecasts about the economy began to emerge last week in a note published on friday economists at jpmorgan chase wrote that they expected global growth to slow to a 1 percent annual pace in the first quarter which would be the weakest quarter of the economic expansion that began after the deep recession that started 12 years ago in the united states the consensus estimate for first quarter domestic growth has slipped to 1 5 percent according to data from factset on monday from 1 7 percent at the end of 2019 economists at goldman sachs who were expecting first quarter domestic growth of 2 percent as recently as late january have been steadily lowering their estimate which fell to 1 2 percent on sunday the risks are clearly skewed to the downside until the outbreak is contained they wrote airline and technology

market tumult rose to a seven year high it s up nearly 10 percent since the start of 2020 and money poured into government bonds pushing down bond yields which move in the opposite direction of prices the yield on the 10 year treasury note fell to 1 37 percent near the record low closing of 1 36 a level touched back in july 2016 the yield on the 30 year bond is already in record low territory at 1 83 percent falling yields can buttress the stock market if they reflect increased expectations for federal reserve rate cuts but a similar decline might also be bad news if it is a result of broad based expectations that growth will weaken the difference between the two is a matter of interpretation but the sharp decline in recent days seems to have pushed investors toward the latter view updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities it s that shift in the narrative that is forcing equity investors to have to wake up from the complacent stupor that they ve been in said lisa shalett chief investment officer at morgan stanley wealth management officials at the federal reserve and within the trump administration are watching the situation closely although the central bank s main tool for stoking growth lowering interest rates might not help much if factories are not producing goods and supply chains are disrupted by quarantines central bank officials have been clear that they did not expect to cut interest rates again unless rising risks upend their outlook for stable growth so far they have cautiously suggested there was no need to sound any alarms but that was before the spike in infections outside china over the weekend the odds of fed cuts are growing a lot roberto perli at cornerstone macro wrote in a note monday but we need to understand that monetary policy is not well equipped to help in the situation we are facing like the fed the white house has been cautious in declaring the disease a major source of concern tomas philipson acting chairman of the white house council of economic advisers said at the national association for business economists conference in washington that it was too early to tell how significant the effects of the virus will be we don t know yet we re sort of taking a wait and see approach he said also noting that the scale of the seasonal influenza is much more significant and that in terms of the public health impact on the economy i think that s been exaggerated advertisement
