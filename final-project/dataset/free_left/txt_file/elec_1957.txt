advertisement supported by by nate cohn and jonathan martin join us for live updates of the march 8 primaries voters go to the polls in four states on tuesday with michigan the biggest prize for both parties donald j trump seeks to strengthen his position as the republican front runner while his rivals look to slow his drive toward the nomination for the democrats senator bernie sanders of vermont faces a crucial test in his upstart campaign to derail hillary clinton here are some of the things we will be watchingin the contests in hawaii idaho michigan and mississippi mr trump had a rough week he faced attacks from the party establishment and criticism for his debate performance on thursday before barely outpacing senator ted cruz of texas on saturday in kentucky and louisiana and losing to him in kansas and maine where mr trump was considered a favorite but it is not clear whether he struggled to win because he had lost ground or because anti trump voters had consolidated around mr cruz mr trump s share of the vote on saturday was roughly in line with what he had won on super tuesday mr cruz finished with a far higher share of the vote than his super tuesday total the outcome on tuesday could be telling if mr trump were to replicate his super tuesday performance he would take about 35 percent of the vote in michigan and 42 percent in mississippi if he were to lose significant ground from last week s vote it could present an opening for one of his rivals it seems clear that mr cruz benefited on saturday from the somewhat sudden slide of senator marco rubio of florida mr rubio managed only 17 percent in the kansas caucuses on saturday and that was his high water mark across four states for the day he bounced back with a decisive victory in puerto rico on sunday but that might not stop him from dropping in the states with the two largest delegate hauls on tuesday michigan and mississippi gov john r kasich of ohio has devoted substantial time to michigan and according to local republican officials backing mr rubio he has cut into the core of mr rubio s support upscale suburban republicans mr rubio also faces the prospect of losing similar voters in mississippi to mr kasich while anti trump conservatives drift to mr cruz there the good news for mr rubio is that he could fare much better in the two other states that vote on tuesday idaho and hawaii but as any west coast heisman trophy contender knows late night success can often be missed by a press corps faced with eastern time zone deadlines though mr cruz benefited from mr rubio s weak performance in kentucky and louisiana it is not clear whether he can make the same gains in michigan it is a blue state with relatively few evangelical voters and mr cruz has struggled so far in such states instead mr kasich could be the candidate who benefits from mr rubio s struggles he is a relatively moderate governor from a neighboring state and polls show he has moved into a tight race with mr cruz for second place the race for second is a test for both mr cruz and mr kasich as each looks to present himself as the strongest trump alternative the second half of the primary season includes many democratic leaning states like california new jersey and new york a strong second place showing in michigan would ameliorate concerns about mr cruz s ability to compete in blue states if mr kasich were to fare better it would set him up for a strong showing in his home state next week on paper michigan should be a good state for mr sanders it is a white working class state that has been ravaged by outsourcing and ought to be receptive to mr sanders s message on economic issues it is also a fairly liberal state with big college towns like ann arbor and east lansing the state is whiter than the nation as a whole and black voters who have turned out in droves for mrs clinton in the south make up roughly the same share of the electorate there as they do nationally the burden for mr sanders in michigan is even higher because he needs to make up for losses in the first part of the primary season with even stronger showings going forward the polls suggest that mrs clinton is on track for a decisive victory so mr sanders needs a surprise win to show he still has a path of his own mr trump rolled through the deep south on super tuesday winning every state in the region some of them in landslides in alabama he routed his nearest competitor mr cruz by more than 22 percentage points but when the race came to louisiana on saturday the outcome looked markedly different mr trump beat mr cruz by about four percentage points and he fared far worse among voters who cast ballots on saturday than those who voted early the mississippi primary will offer some insight into whether mr trump is slipping with some of the party s most conservative voters demographically the state resembles its two neighbors which had such different results it is also filled with christian conservative voters 83 percent of those who cast ballots in the 2012 republican presidential primary called themselves evangelicals the good news for mr trump is that unlike louisiana s primary mississippi s contest is not limited to republicans so he could benefit from the democrats and independents who have been drawn to his candidacy but if mr trump is starting to slip with christian conservatives whether because of his innuendo about his manhood mr cruz s growing strength or both it could be evident here candidates must meet a minimum percentage of the vote in certain states to receive any delegates which are allocated proportionally in the republican race until march 15 starting then states can decide whether to hold winner take all or proportional contests the more candidates who meet the threshold the more delegates are scattered and the less likely it is that any candidate can reach the 1 237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the convention three of the four states where republicans are voting on tuesday have thresholds to win delegates a candidate must receive at least 20 percent of the vote in idaho and at least 15 percent in michigan and mississippi the two candidates most in danger of not reaching the minimum are mr rubio and mr kasich mr rubio learned how much that can hurt on super tuesday when he failed to meet the threshold in three states and was denied all but a handful of delegates if mr rubio and mr kasich are shut out entirely on tuesday it will push the republican contest closer to a two man race advertisement
