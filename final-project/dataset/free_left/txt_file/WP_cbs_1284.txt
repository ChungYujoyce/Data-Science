watch cbsn live updated on april 8 2020 7 00 am cbs news in this episode of intelligence matters host michael morell interviews dr david agus professor of medicine and engineering and founding director and ceo of the lawrence j ellison institute for transformative medicine at the university of southern california dr agus who is also a cbs news contributor explains what scientists have learned about the origins spread transmissibility and lethality of covid 19 as well as what remains a mystery he discusses the policies and practices that have led to successful mitigation efforts and explains how data may be used to better control future global health crises intelligence matters will dedicate several forthcoming episodes to understanding the fundamentals and national security implications of covid 19 social distancing it is an amazing thing to see how behavior in our country when we are put up to the challenge we come through in the united states and i m proud of that what scares me is what we don t know about this virus what scares me is that not everybody not 100 are following the rules areas of success so when you look at countries like germany that have had uniform practices across it south korea china singapore hong kong they clamped down as an entire country with uniform practices and people listened and they understood and they were shamed or there was actually penalties for people who violated then you had a quick silencing of the virus i hope we re getting there in this country the virus vs the economy if you release the stay at home orders and enable the economy to grow the virus grows and the economy falls again precipitously even more than it did before so they are one and in the same how things may change my hope and prayers is we start to use data for good and the data will enable us to find virus outbreaks early to monitor our behavior to make sure we re doing the right thing to really make the health of our society better so we can all focus on the things we enjoy which is personal interactions our job our family our friends and that we actually enable us to use data to make health better i m so excited by the technologies that we have i hope they can be used for social good transcript intelligence matters david agus correspondent michael morell producer olivia gazis jamie benson michael morell dr agus thank you for taking the time to join to talk about this very important issue dr david agus oh it s my privilege to be here michael morell so let s jump right in and i m hoping that we can walk through the issues related to coronavirus in a kind of step by step and hopefully logical way that will depend a lot on my questions but maybe the place to start is kind of at the tactical level with the virus itself so what is a coronavirus why is this one called novel and what is our best understanding of how it originated dr david agus in the 1960s people would be getting colds and a very clever scientist put it under the microscope and they visualized the virus and this particular virus had little projections out of it and it looked like a crown so hence the name coronavirus and so cor about a third of common colds are coronavirus and viruses when they come out a new virus say goes from an animal to a human over time they get weaker because if they were really strong and they knocked people off they couldn t spread anymore so viruses over time get weaker so the common colds that we have now were potent and actually killed people early and then have gotten weaker sometime in probably we know now mid 2019 a new virus went from bat which is about a quarter of the mammals on earth are bats and they have very large numbers of bats and rodents are the largest harbinger of viruses this virus changed and went from a bat to be able to grow in a human realize over five million years our human genome evolved 1 this genome of a virus can evolve 1 in a day so it changes all the time so it jumped from bat to human and was able to spread and so we called it covid 19 19 means 2019 and so it was a coronavirus coronavirus disease covid 19 and that s why it was called this so it was a new virus that we hadn t seen before in humans an amazing paper came out in the one of the medical journals last week where they actually looked at all the dna sequencers and the top dna people in the world looked at it because there were all these rumors that it came from a lab in china and all of that so the conclusion of the paper was how this virus binds to a human cell is so remarkable and amazing that humans don t have the computing power to do it or the brains to do it only nature could do it it is the wildest conclusion of a paper i ve ever seen in my life michael morell so there s no reason to doubt that it originated spread through a natural mechanism there s these stories out there about bioweapons so there s no doubt in your mind about that dr david agus after this paper came out in the medical journal nature it is definitive that this was not engineered by humans michael morell and is this virus related in any way to the sars virus from the early 2000s dr david agus yeah all these viruses are similar in many respects and they re a similar family and they all just behave differently and whenever we see a new virus we can t tell you its natural course when people say well will this go away in the summer or not we don t know if i say if you got the virus can you get it again in a year the answer is i don t know because we haven t studied it for a year so this is new so this is new and that s what s kind of daunting to scientists to doctors to patients to everybody is when you don t know what to expect we all just get very stressed we want to understand more than we do michael morell so what is it about this virus that makes it so dangerous dr david agus what we know about this virus is the day you have symptoms the first symptoms your virus level is the highest normally when you get a virus a cold or a flu you have a low level of virus and the symptoms are there and the virus slowly builds up but because it s the highest the day you get symptoms that means three four days before you had symptoms when you were asymptomatic you can spread the virus and about 20 of people never get any symptoms at all and they have a period where they can spread the virus so this stealth spread if you will is what makes this virus so hard to tackle when ebola came out you knew you were sick so we quarantined you and it was very easy to block it off and a certain number of people died which is still tragic but it s a small number here because people don t know they have it and they end up going to a church service or they get in a gondola in aspen and they breathe and everyone in the gondola is infected or they go to a beach in florida and they don t know they have it they re asymptomatic they don t mean to harm people but they did because it spreads and spreads michael morell and then what about the lethality of it dr david agus so this is the tricky part and this is the part that keeps me up at night is that 98 of people have mild symptoms maybe a little bit moderate but nothing more than that two percent of people get very severe symptoms and end up hospitalized some of them on a ventilator and some of them will die the problem is i can t tell you which 2 so everybody thinks they re in that 2 they re worried about it and if we had the clue of who was the 2 i could treat them aggressively upfront i could try to prevent in those people i would have some knowledge instead we have to clamp down the whole country so i don t know who that 2 is just last week i saw a couple 50 years old she was jogging five miles a day he was overweight and had medical issues she ended up on a ventilator he didn t and he was fine why did that happen by not knowing that that s one of the biggest clues that we re missing michael morell so there s this idea out there right that the elderly are more at risk of dying and people with preexisting conditions are more at risk of dying are you saying that we re still trying to understand that dr david agus well they are at much much higher risk of dying so what i was talking is the 2 will get severe disease and be hospitalized or be sick many of those are 30 40 50 and 60 year olds but they re the ones who get better the 70 80 and 90 year olds general don t get better unfortunately and so when they get hospitalized there s a much higher mortality rate michael morell oh i see so what actually happens to your body when this virus infects it what physically happens to you dr david agus so this virus enters through a receptor in the lung and it s called ace2 and then your body starts to make an immune response against the virus and so when people start to get difficulty breathing it s not the virus causing any problem anymore it s your immune response to the problem and the immune response says hey i see a virus there let me make the blood vessels leaky so more immune cells can get in and attack it when the blood vessels get leaky in the lungs you know how when you fall and you skin your elbow it gets swollen that s getting leaky so immune cells can come in and clear away all the gunk and the bacteria and things but when it gets leaky in the lung that fluid makes it so oxygen can t go into the arteries and you can t breathe and then when there s fluid there and you can t breathe we have to use pressure and that s what a ventilator does it puts pressure in to be able to still deliver oxygen to the blood vessels so it s the immune response causing the problem not the virus at the end stages so that s why many of the treatments that we re doing now were meant for autoimmune arthritis or lupus or other diseases where it s actually blocking immune responses to help patients michael morell so you mentioned this briefly earlier doctor but latest estimates of time from time of infection to symptoms dr david agus two to nine days michael morell and during that entire time can you infect others or just a period of that time dr david agus the amazing thing in today s world where we can send a man to the moon 50 years ago although we haven t done it in a while i still can t tell you if you re infectious or not the way we know if you re infectious is by anecdotes by stories i was exposed to the virus and then two days later i talked to jane and jane got the virus therefore i was infectious at day two and so what we think and again i have to emphasize that word think because there s no assay for are you infectious is that you re infectious two to three days maybe four before you re symptomatic so if you have a very big viral load what we think is you were exposed to a lot of virus someone coughed a big amount you breathed in a lot of virus you re going to be symptomatic pretty quickly if you have a tiny bit just a couple droplets maybe it ll take you nine ten days to become symptomatic and you ll be infectious two or three days before that michael morell and you mentioned this earlier too but we hear about this big group of folks who are asymptomatic what does that mean why don t they get sick and are they still able to infect others dr david agus that s the million dollar question is that there s no question they can infect others that they are predominantly of the younger generations what we don t know is if their immunity they were able to fight off the virus does that mean that they have good immunity and they won t get it again in a year or two years or three years will that immunity last will it not last we don t know any of those and again we don t even know how many of those people there are many of them didn t have any symptoms so they were never tested many of them had mild symptoms and they go oh it s just cold it s not worth going in and standing in line and getting a test and so until we have what we call the post exposure test which was just announced yesterday the first one which is a blood test that can look if you have immunity or not we re not going to know the true penetrance we re not going to know the denominator how many people have it in the country and have been exposed and how many asymptomatics there are the figure of 21 asymptomatic came from china and we re not sure how accurate that data is if it underestimates dramatically the exposure we don t know listen we all had little periods over the last couple weeks where you can envision a couple symptoms i feel a little bit tired and achy maybe i have it and it went away the next day i just don t know so that test is going to be critical right now it s a blood test where i have to stick a needle in draw a tube of blood and do that test pretty soon it ll be a finger prick and the hope is it ll be a finger prick at home where you put it on a piece of paper you mail that paper in and i can give you the result because i don t want people going to a doctor s office right now getting that test because again it could be a conduit for spread if you will but it s an easy test it s called an elisa cheap and easy michael morell so what about folks who have gotten sick perhaps very sick and they ve gotten better can they get infected again do we know that dr david agus we don t know we don t know and so that s only going to tell by time because there are two ways right that you can get infected again one is your immunity wears off and the second is the virus changes so your immunity was to one virus but the virus is a little bit different so that immunity won t carry over to the new virus and so there are certain proteins on the outside in the luggage if you will of the virus remember this virus is not alive it s basically a package with instructions inside which is rna and so your immunity is against the package well if it s to part of the package that could change that the virus doesn t really need it may not hold over till a year from now when the virus changes if it s to something that s integral to the virus it ll carry on michael morell so let me ask maybe a stupid question but where do viruses come from how do they get created dr david agus ha ha viruses are a part of nature that were meant to actually speed up and help with evolution they transfer dna from species to species and they re actually part of us and have enabled the evolution tree to happen and so viruses are common if we look at our genome there are gobs of viruses in there thousands and thousands of viruses are part of us and it s part of our what we call microbiome are bacteria and viruses you have more viral dna and bacterial dna in you as a human than you do human dna and they control these bacteria and these viruses how you metabolize food many aspects around you the problem is some of them are what we call pathogenic and they can cause problems particularly newer ones like this michael morell i see and they re always changing and so they can change into something that becomes pathogenic when it didn t start that way dr david agus josh lederberg a nobel laureate one of the greatest scientists in our history said the only thing that will threaten humans dominance on earth is the virus it is our wits versus their genome and it was such a powerful two sentences and he said this 30 plus years ago that nobody really paid attention but it really was prescient at the time michael morell yeah and i want to come back to something you said earlier because i hear people say this all the time people will look at a map of where the outbreaks are in the world and they say they see seasonality right because there s all these cases in the northern hemisphere and fewer in the southern hemisphere and they say ah seasonality but your point earlier is we don t know that is that correct dr david agus no question about it there s kind of this misnomer out there well in heat the virus goes away when it becomes summer kids are no longer in school so they re not confined in one area we re outside we re not indoors where we can spread things so our behavior changes in the summer so in areas of the country right now where it s hot we still have the same behavior as winter behavior we re still in schools and others so the virus spread so i think it s more our behavior changes as i look outside it s sunny in los angeles now uv sunlight degrades the virus so you are a lot safer outdoors than obviously in the indoors and the indoors where lots of people are that s what happened in the cold the blood vessels constrict you get a little bit of fluid coming out your nose that s a conduit you touch it that s a conduit for spreading a virus you don t have that in the summer so it s not that the virus changes as much as we change michael morell i see and i heard somewhere that there s a vitamin d issue involved so when we get more sunlight we get higher levels of vitamin d and that might dr david agus no michael morell play a role here is that right no dr david agus no it s not accurate michael morell okay okay dr david agus unfortunately there are a lot of people who are trying to find simple kind of reductionist answers to this take this or do this but no there s no correlation between immunity and vitamin d which people get upset when i say but there have been many large studies done with supplementing vitamin d from various means to try to help with immunity and none of them have ever worked there s no correlation michael morell okay excellent i will stop taking my vitamin d pill dr david agus i m saving you money michael morell so let s go to the bigger picture here so what does coronavirus look like in context right how does it at this stage compare to the average seasonal flu to the 1918 or 1957 flu pandemics or the 2009 swine flu outbreak put this is in context for us dr david agus 1918 was an interesting one the spanish flu which by the way started in kansas and not spain right it was world war i and so the media weren t allowed to talk about anything that would show weakness in the country so we weren t allowed to talk about it and that spread like wildfire the way we stopped it is exactly how we re doing it now is we said you cannot congregate in more than groups of three close all churches close all schools close all sporting events and we really did stay at home for a year and we were able to stop it and so that was before air travel the problem now right is that things happen literally overnight because of airplanes and so in 1918 it circled the globe three times as it killed and decimated the number of people it did and we all see the models out now 40 of the globe millions of people dying all of those models said it will happen over three years it wasn t all at once and all of the models meant with no social distancing with no medications that work with no chance of a vaccine with no growth in medical infrastructure all of which are going to prove counter so we re not going to hit what all the models say because our medical infrastructure is responding every city is looking at what new york city did right and wrong and we re changing and we re adapting there the drugs are starting to show potential benefit and it s very encouraging we have several vaccine candidates already into patients we are social distancing and it is working in the cities that are doing it well so all of that is great but then you look at just the modern world there s an amazing video just last week of one county in florida closed their beaches another county didn t and what you see is just people up to one border where the county stopped and it was empty yet on the other side of that county line lots of people on the beach and the problem is they actually followed the cell phone of people that were on a beach and see where they went and they all got on a plane and went all across the country so we can spread things easily through air transportation so even if your state is perfect all you need is somebody from the state next door where they re still allowed to go to religious services and it could spread virus back to your state and you re going to ruin all of the social distancing your state did so this is a new era where we have to work as a community and think together as one and that s difficult but critically important we have a thing of state s rights where health is dictated by the states in our country not the federal government so it s still today governors send an e mail they re asked to every week how many tests did you do what were the results the federal government doesn t have the right of taking that data the states have to give it to the government in an excel spreadsheet that s crazy to me michael morell yeah so doctor as of today and we re taping this on a friday before the wednesday that we re going to release it today we have 240 000 confirmed cases but as you said earlier there s probably more people out there who are infected because to have a confirmed case you have to have a positive test right so do you have a sense of how many more people may be infected than the 240 000 that have been confirmed dr david agus it s a critical question and because testing has been so limited in the affected areas of our country it s been hard to answer the government was right when they say there are plenty of tests because there are the problem is we don t have the infrastructure to run those tests so it s not the number of tests now where it was initially the limiting factor it s the fact that we only have a certain number of pcr machines what the test does it looks at a hundred letters of the virus s 30 000 letter code and you have to amplify that through a technology and you need certain people to run it who are good at running it who know how to run it and you need these machines that are rather expensive to do it and so we don t have that infrastructure and so even today in california there s still a five to six day delay until you get your test results back because there s a backlog and most people are disincentivized from getting a test if you have mild symptoms and i say get a test you re going to really go and stand in an emergency room where if you weren t positive when you went in you positive when you come out this idea of the drive through testing i think these are great but there are only a few of them in the country some of them are operating well others have crazy long lines our infrastructure just hasn t been built so i can t answer that question my gut is the number is underestimated the 240 000 by anywhere from four to tenfold underestimated michael morell and it s really important to know that number right because dr david agus oh yeah michael morell you need that number to understand the mortality at the end of the day dr david agus so as we get the post exposure test we can go into a city and say hey let me just test a thousand people and have that be representative and say what percent of them were exposed and then i can extrapolate and models can give you real numbers so my gut is over the next several weeks we re going to start to have those numbers as those tests get more common michael morell let me ask you a question about testing that i have not heard before so i m an economist by training and so i spent a lot of time in college and graduate school taking statistics courses do we know the false positive and false negative rates on the testing that we re doing now dr david agus false positive with this test should be near zero it s very hard to get a false positive when you re looking for an rna so in pcr the false negative results are anywhere up to i would say 20 30 potentially if you have less symptoms your false negative rate is higher if you have more symptoms your false negative rate is lower but again those are estimates it s very hard to know what is true in order to get false negative and false positive you need what is the truth and so the problem is we don t have a denominator of truth yet to know to go back so it s all estimates in order to know i need to know yes they really did have it and you said no well i have that in some cases but most cases i don t have the follow up to know what real ground truth was so my gut is it ll be 20 30 false negative but again it s just a gut right now michael morell yeah yeah okay so the public health protocols do we have in your mind any options beyond stay at home social distancing is that our only option at the moment or are there others dr david agus no you had the mayors of new york city and los angeles announce and i think the white house may announce today is that we want you to wear masks this is a predominantly droplet spread disease you know when you stand in front of a mirror and breathe that fog is droplets so our breathing creates droplets whether you re symptomatic or not you create droplets when you wear a bandana so we don t want you to wear n95 masks because they re in limited supply but when you wear a homemade mask you basically block those droplets you wear a bandana and breathe on a mirror you re not going to see the fog and so if we all wore bandanas when we go out we would stop because we need to go out now to go shopping and other things we would stop spread of the virus period also and it wouldn t be 100 but it would add more to it the more we can get so that the number of people the person infected whenever one person is infected and infects more than one other person the virus will continue to grow if it s less than one that number is low then the virus won t grow and will slowly peter away we have to stop it like that so our behavior change has to do more than just staying inside when we have to go out and anybody s who s out whether you re working at a cash register or an emt you need to wear something so you can t spread if you re asymptomatic michael morell and if we had massive testing would that give us more options or would the public health protocol be exactly the same dr david agus oh yeah we have this thing that we re very proud of in the united states called privacy rules in korea if you re tested all of your neighbors get a text hey david in apartment 3b has corona so they know to avoid me and they know who s infected and they actually trace where i went and anybody i talked to on my phone they went back a week before it who did david just meet let me test them and see if they re positive or not they actually say screw privacy let s look at all of that data google announced today that they have the data from google maps of who s effectively doing social distancing and can send out what city and they re giving it to the cities they re not releasing publicly which i think they should but wouldn t it be amazing to know who s following the rules and not and then the ones who aren t we have to figure out different rules to enact because we all have to do it we all have to think as one to get rid of this this is an amazing part of humanity where we have to go back to being a community it s a new change in our mentality and our behavior that we really haven t thought about for decades michael morell well i m wondering if this gets severe enough that if americans would welcome the kind of things they re doing in south korea and singapore and elsewhere dr david agus i hope so but what it s going to mean is we have to treat people differently which again we don t respond well to if you have no immunity and you re 70 i m going to say you have to stay home and you can t go out if you re a 20 year old and again you have no immunity i m going to say you can t go out but the other 20 year old can and people are going to say no way i have my rights i want to do this i don t want people to know i had the virus or i could have spread it or i spread it somebody else it s my right to keep my healthcare information private i don t want you to mine my healthcare data to figure out who gets sick and who doesn t this is my data if i asked you to get a mortgage you d give me every financial record you have and you don t think twice if i say let me use your healthcare to better treating humanity and the rest of the world you say no way it s my healthcare data michael morell yeah so how significant do you think the ancillary health effects of staying at home are of loneliness and depression et cetera are you seeing that dr david agus yeah my hope is that we re all learning ways to overcome it and we re working as a community so we re facetiming or video chatting with our parents with our grandparents with friends we re developing a community listen i ve heard from people i haven t heard from in decades and they re all checking in how are you and texting me and i love that part of it but we all have to be cognizant of the people who don t have support systems if i m going to get food and my neighbor s 80 i text her or call her and say hey listen i can order food for you and get food for you also you know it s a time to step up and help each other we can all be part of the solution technology will enable all of us to be part of the solution not the problem and i think we have to step up right one of the biggest tendencies to staying at home is just eating right food is always available we have this thing called a kitchen cabinet you want to just have three meals a day with nothing in between if you graze during the day your stress hormones actually stay up and your immunity goes down you have to walk your lymphatics that control your immune system have no muscle in their walls so it s the rhythmic contraction of the muscles in your legs when you walk that actually make your body work so walk around whether it be your apartment or your house if you can find a time to get outside and just take a small walk whether it be a backyard or just around the block when there aren t a lot of people and you can social distance it s critical that we think of our health also michael morell okay so the snacks go away with the vitamin d tablets that s excellent dr david agus all right michael morell so walk us through dr david agus any other issues of yourself you want to talk about michael morell so walk us through the testing issue right can you kind of summarize why were we in such a bad place at the beginning and where are we now and are we on the road to where we need to be et cetera can you kind of put that in context dr david agus the world health organization developed a test and was giving it out to member countries the united states in partly its hubris and partly it was justified we have pretty good science compared to most countries said we re going to develop our own test and we re going to do it well the initial approaches at testing were successful but the problem is the controls that is knowing whether the test worked or not didn t work for a bunch of batches tested so all of a sudden the initial batches of tests that went out in the country were faulty and people weren t using them and so we didn t have enough tests to go around there was a panic a large amount of testing came out the government started to say hey private industry get involved private industry gets involved they were pretty freaking good in today s world and i know i m going to offend people by saying this but if you re the best and the brightest you go to work for a tech company you don t go to work for the federal government in a testing lab and i wish it weren t so because those are heroes in those testing labs and so once you get private industry that can put a thousand people on a problem basically turn on a dime and attack something all of a sudden we had large numbers of tests and they were out there we still don t have the infrastructure to run those tests and realize what the test is it the virus has instructions called rna inside and this amplifies a hundred letters of that rna that are specific and unique to this covid 19 and it amplifies it and then you see are those hundred letters that represent two of the genes of the virus and there are 30 000 letters in that virus are those two genes there or not and if they re there both of them you have the virus if they re not there it doesn t mean you don t have the virus so a positive is a positive but a negative means maybe we just missed how we tested or where we tested it so it doesn t mean you re totally negative that s where the false negatives come in but a positive is a positive michael morell so you mentioned the intrusiveness of south korea s approach when you look broadly at the countries that have handled the crisis well and those who have not handled it so well what are the main differences that you see dr david agus the wildest anecdote i see is that when they northern italy had a big outbreak and we saw it right after fashion week big big number of cases surged in northern italy so what they did was they closed all of northern italy just like we did in many of our states 40 of our states but they left southern italy open so what happened is everybody from northern italy got in their car or got on a train and went to southern italy where you can go shopping and go to restaurants and basically policy caused spread of the virus amazing policy caused spread of the virus and so unless you have uniform policy across the country what you see is that so the countries that are saying we have to shut down our entire country and our borders are having very good results and are able to get rid of the virus with time the biggest problem is that there s about a nine to ten day incubation period on average there is about a two week period of having the virus so when you make an intervention you don t see the results till two three weeks down the road and that s difficult and that s frustrating right i m losing my business i m staying at home yet the number of cases are still going up it s very hard with that delay countries that have leadership that is explaining that and showing why that behavior change matters and really every day giving out updates on that they re having pretty impressive results countries that are just all over the place one day has a scare tactic one day doesn t they re not and have disparate results by states which is what we re doing the results aren t as good so when you look at countries like germany that have had uniform practices across it south korean china singapore hong kong they clamped down as an entire country with uniform practices and people listened and they understood and they were shamed or there was actually penalties for people who violated then you had a quick silencing of the virus i hope we re getting there in this country michael morell do you think the general health of a country s population is playing a role here when you look at asia you don t see a lot of obese people right but then you look at some countries in the west and it s a different picture does that matter dr david agus we think it does certainly the trends in the united states is we re seeing more people who are very symptomatic in their 30 s 40 s and 50 s and we think it s a hypothesis purely is that it s because we are more obese and we do have more elevated blood pressure which may increase the receptor for this virus called ace2 it s a hypothesis certainly we as a country we are not as attuned as others about restrictions on eating and exercise and obviously it s a wakeup call for us it matters over and over again we re seeing policy changes in certain countries in certain countries you re allowed to smoke but if you get lung cancer you have to pay a 60 000 surcharge because why should the nonsmokers subsidize the smokers in our country we need to bring back responsibility for behavior i think and really educate people why behavior matters because obviously it can affect the entire country michael morell so we re heard dr fauci say that the timing of the country s reopening is going to be dictated by the virus not policy how should we think about how quarantining and social distancing protocols can eventually be scaled back what would make sense what would you have to see for you to feel comfortable in doing that dr david agus it s very hard to look at incidence of the virus as the number of cases because as we ve alluded to before the testing but number of hospitalizations is a pretty good metric right i mean the hospitalizations themselves don t lie and so looking at the number of patients who are being hospitalized in a city can be powerful and it may be that we restrict it in certain areas of the country and we restrict travel if we re only seeing growth in california well basically we ll say listen the rest of the country can leave their home but california we re going to restrict and nobody can go or leave in california until the numbers come down and people aren t going to be happy with that but i think in a data driven way to release parts of the country not others is probably what s going to happen and so my hope is that s an incentive to leaders at the local and the state levels to really say we want our state to be one of the ones that can actually go back to our business as usual and push in that regard but it has to be data driven and i think the question now is what are the metrics that we have to follow on the local on the regional and the federal level to being able to do that and there s lots of talk now about what they are and we re developing these indices if you will michael morell and i certainly don t want to put words in your mouth but i m sure you see a significant risk of relaxing those protocols too soon dr david agus no question about it right that s the risk and everybody says well are you going to think about the economy or are you going to think about health or the virus well they re inexorably tied right if you release the stay at home orders and enable the economy to grow the virus grows and the economy falls again precipitously even more than it did before so they are one and in the same and anybody who tries to get reductionist say well it s got to be the virus versus the economy has no idea what they re talking about michael morell and then final question doctor on sort of the big picture here the cdc numbers their estimates on the number of deaths worst case best case most likely case those make sense to you dr david agus it s hard to me what makes sense any model is done on behavior today and what is if we extrapolate out from today till tomorrow to a month from now to three months from now what could happen the good is is that we re seeing behavior change daily we re seeing more states with stay at home orders we re seeing medications being used and showing efficacy we re seeing changes in medical infrastructure we re seeing states learning what the good and bad of new york city s response is and changing so what that means is every model will overestimate death rates because we re getting better at doing what we do so any model you can see in a sense is worst case scenario because they re not modeling in the changes that we re all doing and so my hope and prayers are those models are three four times what is going to happen and any death that was avoidable is obviously a travesty or we re upset about but when you see numbers 100 000 to 240 000 i think those are way gross estimates to what s actually going to happen overestimates sorry michael morell maybe we can take a brief couple of minutes here to talk about treatment and prevention so where are we on treating somebody who is sick and where are we on a vaccine and kind of walk us through those dr david agus so treating it falls into two buckets one is what we call post exposure prophylaxis so say your spouse had influenza i would give you ten days of tamiflu and you wouldn t get the flu if you had sex with someone with hiv i d give you a couple of days of an anti retroviral and you wouldn t get hiv we call that post exposure prophylaxis so the protocols now for frontline workers for spouses of people or live with people who have the virus are now we re starting to use drugs in that setting to try to prevent people from getting the disease and then in terms of treating the disease what we know initially from the china data and now in the u s is the earlier you treat the better as we ve talked about before is if we can block the virus before the immune system is crazily activated we re going to do better and there are drugs now that appear to be working and i say that word appear with quotation marks around it because there are randomized trials for example in china that shows that hydroxychloroquine which is the drug that president trump talked about about a week ago although it may be longer than that my time horizon is off in this world we live in today michael morell yeah yeah dr david agus you know that he talked about showed that it was significantly better in time to fever resolution x rays of people worsening of disease it did better this is a drug that s been around for 30 or 40 years it costs about three four dollars without health insurance so it s very inexpensive and it was meant to treat lupus or it s on the market for lupus and to prevent malaria and it actually works against this virus it seems there s a drug called remdesivir which is an experimental drug from a company called gilead there s an hiv cocktail called kaletra there are some japanese drugs that have been shown efficacy and all of those are initially showing potential benefits the problem is randomized placebo controlled trials first of all nobody wants to be in the placebo arm second of all these trials take a long time to get full outcome and we don t have time for that so now doctors are starting to treat patients routinely with these drugs and i m into that we re at war now and so we call that off label use or compassionate use if it s drug that s not yet on the market and we re doing that routinely and the hope is now we re keeping the data and we re learning from every experience and getting better at it and that s what s encouraging and exciting is that there s doctors talking now the federal government you ll see announced on friday that they re going to start to build this database so every patient experience makes the next patient experience better but i m enthused about that in terms of vaccines remember for three decades we ve been trying to make a vaccine for coronavirus the common cold we haven t succeeded the hope now this new emphasis every major biotech and pharmaceutical company all scientists are working on it that we re putting the best and the brightest minds to develop a vaccine that something will work so the initial one which was a vaccine where actually we didn t inject parts of the virus which is what we normally do we actually injected the codes for parts of the virus called rna into cells that vaccine has already accrued patients and is ongoing now to see if it s starting to show immune responses johnson johnson is about to go into the clinic with a new vaccine and there are about a half a dozen behind that the problem is you first have to show that it can induce an immune response then you have to show that it s safe and what is the right dose then you have to actually show it works so it takes 12 to 18 months to develop a vaccine it s not like a treatment where you know in a week whether it works or not this is a much longer timeframe so the hope by next year we can do that and still it will have dramatic benefit across the globe and all efforts should be pushed to do it but it s not going to help us in the short run the vaccine part michael morell so doctor you ve been absolutely terrific with your time i just want to ask you two more questions the first is what makes you most worried here and what makes you most hopeful dr david agus hopeful is the drugs are starting to show benefit our medical infrastructure really is coming up and i think the behavior of people in our country it almost brings me to tears when i think about how radically all of us have changed our behavior to work together as one it is beautiful it is an amazing thing to see how behavior in our country when we are put up to the challenge we come through in the united states and i m proud of that what scares me is what we don t know about this virus what scares me is that not everybody not 100 are following the rules and so a couple of people a couple of instances just yesterday a couple of churches said we are still going to have services and pull people together and just some of those instances can really hurt everybody in a community and hurt especially the elderly dramatically and i don t want to see that happen and we all have to step up and work together and i don t think people are doing it to be bad people or bad intent i think it s lack of knowledge and so i think we have to be better at the education side we have to be better at the leadership side and step up and the leaders are not just going to come from government they re going to come from science they re going to come from religion they re going to come from companies and when i see ceos coming out and saying to their employees and explaining it and bringing in scientists to talk to employees paying their employees when they re not working it s a beautiful thing when our country comes together like that and so my hope is we actually have positive come out of this in the long run michael morell and that is the final question right which is from the perspective of a physician how do you think this experience is going to change how we live our lives in the future i know that s a tough question dr david agus i think it s just the one notion of real world evidence our scientific system was built on the foundation of prospective clinical trials that can take months to years to do and in today s world with all the technology we have we can look at your movement by looking at your cell phone i can collect your data almost instantaneously my hope and prayers is we start to use data for good and the data will enable us to find virus outbreaks early to monitor our behavior to make sure we re doing the right thing to really make the health of our society better so we can all focus on the things we enjoy which is personal interactions our job our family our friends and that we actually enable us to use data to make health better i m so excited by the technologies that we have i hope they can be used for social good michael morell dr agus thank you so much for joining us i know you re incredibly busy but we really appreciate it thank you dr david agus oh it s my privilege talk to you soon michael morell thanks
