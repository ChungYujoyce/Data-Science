expectations are running high that reopening the united states will mean returning to offices factories and schools kick starting the economy and rediscovering life before the novel coronavirus pandemic at best these alluring goals are likely to be achieved haltingly partially more slowly than we would like and how haltingly will depend heavily on how well the nation undertakes a mammoth set of public health tasks the inescapable fact is that in the absence of a vaccine or drug therapy for the next year or more a highly infectious virus will roam the country and the world and only strenuous actions can prevent continuing flare ups or new explosions such as wuhan bergamo or new york city tom frieden former director of the centers for disease control and prevention has usefully outlined four tasks first wide scale testing must be deployed to know who is sick and who is not second those infected must be isolated from the healthy and susceptible third everyone who had been in contact with the sick must be traced fourth those contacts have to be isolated to prevent further spread all four have to be accomplished to box in the virus he says unfortunately there are stubborn unresolved problems with all four it will be catastrophic if the next phase unfolds with the kind of chaotic supply shortages and lack of leadership we have seen over the past few months diagnostic tests to see whether people are sick have been running at about 140 000 a day reported by the states only a fraction of what is needed for phase two serological testing to see who has recovered with antibodies that might confer immunity from reinfection has never been done at this scale many tests are in the works but technical and biomedical uncertainty remain including regarding how long the antibodies last and how strongly they may protect former food and drug administration commissioner scott gottlieb and former fda chief of staff lauren silvis have suggested that employers ought to take on some of the burden for testing bringing it into workplaces making it more routine and widespread contact tracing finding those who were near the sick is labor intensive public health departments have the know how but nowhere near the tens of thousands of workers who will be required where will these armies of workers come from the problem will most likely fall into the lap of states and cities given president trump s inept leadership hopefully some help will come from smartphone apps but those also raise questions and in any case can t entirely render shoe leather detectives obsolete reopening the economy is an aspiration shared by all as is quick development of a therapy or vaccine but aspirations won t get us there we should plan for the possibility that neither vaccine nor cure emerges for 18 months or longer in that world getting people back to work safely without fits and starts will take leadership and planning with involvement of all levels of government the private sector and the population it won t be quick or easy sign up for our coronavirus updates newsletter to track the outbreak all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access read more danielle allen the best way out of this pandemic is to massively scale up testing here s how to do it eric topol how digital data collection can help track covid 19 cases in real time the post s view location data could help fight covid 19 but privacy must be protected tim searchinger anthony lamantia and gordon douglas mass testing is the only sustainable solution henry olsen three cheers for big pharma as it rushes to develop a vaccine live updates the latest in the u s coronavirus maps cases and deaths in the u s cases and deaths worldwide which states are reopening what you need to know your life at home personal finance guide make your own fabric mask follow all of our coronavirus coverage and sign up for our daily newsletter how to help your community seniors restaurants keep at risk people in mind have you been hospitalized for covid 19 tell us whether you ve gotten a bill receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
