video contains a warning from facebook s third party fact checkers that it could contain partly false information a spokesperson for the american chiropractic association told buzzfeed news that it was urging its members not to spread misinformation amid the outbreak the aca advises its members to follow guidance regarding the prevention of the coronavirus covid 19 from the centers for disease control and prevention and other credible sources and to share this information with their patients the spokesperson said the spokesperson also said that the aca board of governors released a statement to clarify that there is no substantial evidence to support that spinal adjustments the core method that chiropractors use to treat patients could prevent or treat covid 19 a facebook post by chiropractor kim gambino even though the video has gone astoundingly viral in little under a week nepute s advice is not only wrong it could be dangerous dr luis ostrosky a professor of infectious diseases at mcgovern medical school at the university of texas health science center at houston told buzzfeed news that the treatments nepute was advocating for in his video have no scientific basis i m guessing he s going off of quinine as another antimalarial drug ostrosky said there s really nothing in the literature about quinine and covid 19 he explained that quinine has some similarities to chloroquine which president donald trump and his supporters have touted as a miracle drug for the coronavirus despite the publishers of the journal that had published the study touting chloroquine later saying it did not meet expected standards among other criticisms of the study ostrosky said that there has been some evidence that zinc lozenges could alleviate some symptoms of the common cold which has led some people to falsely extrapolate that it could be a way to combat covid 19 we should warn people about zinc it causes severe gastrointestinal distress he said if it sounds too easy and too obvious it s probably not true outside of facebook nepute s video lives on it has been viewed an additional 2 8 million times on youtube uploaded under titles like frank hahnel a real doctor telling it like it is it s all fake the youtube version was shared heavily on twitter by qanon affiliated accounts one of its biggest referrers on facebook was from the actor antonio sab to jr who unsuccessfully ran for congress in ventura county california in 2018 dr ravina kullar an infectious diseases researcher told buzzfeed news she had seen nepute s video and cautioned chiropractors not to use social media to spread misinformation or miracle cures being a medical expert or a medical professional you re given that responsibility that whatever comes out of your mouth people are going to run with it she said kullar said that people need to be especially careful about cures touted on platforms like facebook and youtube my fear is that hearing this claim people might overdose on zinc overdose on the quinine in tonic water she said you just see everyone trying to find something with the cure the chiropractic community has roots in 19th century pseudoscience and despite an effort in the 21st century to move to more evidence based treatments nepute is far from the only chiropractor spreading hoaxes about the coronavirus the twitter account for a clinic in virginia on monday told its followers to stop worrying about the germs and start taking care of the host a chiropractor from colorado shared a tweet on sunday that accused the nwo new world order of forcing people to wear face masks a chiropractor in new jersey shared a video from a qanon affiliated twitter account claiming the coronavirus death toll was fake and on tiktok california based chiropractor alicia tsounis promoted colloidal silver spray which is ineffective at killing the coronavirus earlier this month an idaho chiropractor who had previously posted videos advocating against vaccines ran facebook ads falsely claiming his products could prevent covid 19 in one promoted video how to prevent covid 19 virus from infecting you he advised people to use a silver spray instead of alcohol based hand sanitizer facebook disabled his ad account and removed his page chiropractor kim gambino the wife of former head of the california chiropractic association dan gambino has been regularly using her public facebook page to promote conspiracy theories about covid 19 gambino has shared content railing against social distancing and is also a proponent of the conspiracy theory that 5g cellular technology is causing the coronavirus do you think these microwaves could be causing the same symptoms as the coronavirus gambino wrote last month facebook s fact check widget even appears under one of gambino s posts indicating a third party fact checker for the platform believed the post contained harmful content about covid 19 buzzfeed news has reached out to gambino for comment a facebook post by chiropractor gilles lamarche andrew williams the president of the california chiropractic association distanced himself from members of his profession spreading conspiracy theories there s always certain people he told buzzfeed news you ll have your outliers williams said that he believes many chiropractors are following guidelines from regulatory bodies and doing their best to share positive information without panicking people but gambino s facebook comments are full of other chiropractors agreeing with her posts about how the mainstream scientific information about the coronavirus is a lie she also shares posts from other outspoken chiropractors like gilles lamarche the vice president of university advancement at life university a georgia based school for chiropractic and other health industries full of conspiratorial covid 19 content lamarche s public facebook page has a small following of several thousand people last week lamarche shared a video from
