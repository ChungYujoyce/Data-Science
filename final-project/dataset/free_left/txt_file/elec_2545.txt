 des moines when jeb bush stepped up onto the fabled soapbox at the iowa state fair on friday fairgoers pelted him with questions about the legacy of his brother a former president and his father another former president and one of his foreign policy advisers paul d wolfowitz the architect of his brother s war in iraq and about the war itself under a blazing sun bush expressed irritation with what he called the parlor game of focusing on wolfowitz and other past bush administration advisers who have resurfaced for this bush campaign if i m president we will have a strategy on day one to take out this grave threat to our national security and to the world he said i promise you that this was supposed to be the week when bush would finally lay out his own thoughts on how to combat the islamic state terror group and put hillary rodham clinton on the defensive and wrest himself from his family legacy in the process but over several days it has become evident that his ideas on the subject are remarkably similar to george w bush s ideas and that he firmly believes that democrats not his brother deserve the blame for the unrest in iraq and neighboring syria his new struggles with the issue also come as he is fading in polls and being drowned out by the angry outsiders dominating the race according to bush this week the removal of saddam hussein from power turned out to be a pretty good deal the 2007 troop surge was an extraordinarily effective strategy by the time his brother left office he said the mission was accomplished in iraq because security had been restored bush also said he won t rule out waterboarding in the interrogation of terrorism suspects although he added i do think in general that torture is not appropriate jeb bush faults hillary clinton for premature iraq withdrawal bush faults president obama for his unwillingness to talk directly about radical islamic terrorists and clinton for visiting iraq only once as secretary of state he said it might be necessary to deploy more u s forces to both iraq and syria and that troops already on the ground should be embedded more closely with local forces as for questions about advisers bush told fairgoers friday that he has a young team working at his campaign headquarters in miami shrugging bush said any veteran gop foreign policy advisers had to deal with two republican administrations run by his brother and father i mean this is kind of a tough game to be playing to be honest with you he said i m my own person in an interview friday radio host hugh hewitt asked bush whether it s easier or harder for him to talk about national security given his last name bush shot back it doesn t matter i m the first candidate to have a view on this with enough detail for people to see what the world would look like if i m president but democrats are eager to exploit bush s remarks this week to remind voters of his family ties during a town hall in dubuque iowa on friday afternoon clinton took aim at bush s criticism of her noting that his brother signed an agreement as president to withdraw combat troops from the country by 2011 i do think that it s a little bit surprising to hear jeb bush talk about this she said he expects the american people to have a collective case of amnesia later in the town hall clinton sought to single out jeb bush s comments on women s issues but mistakenly referred to him as george bush i get confused she said seeming to relish her error oh well most americans still believe the iraq war was a mistake and are opposed to new military engagement making jeb bush s approach to national security risky but polling suggests that his positions are popular among most republicans especially if it means raising doubts about clinton s tenure as secretary of state jeb is going to talk about the threat of radical islamic terrorism and how to defeat it said tim miller bush s campaign communications director if the democrats want to talk about the past that s their prerogative but the american people are looking for someone who will address today s growing terror threat and they didn t get it from obama clinton the world according to jeb bush among his gop rivals sen rand paul r ky has said that it was a mistake to topple hussein while new jersey gov chris christie says it makes no sense for us to be re litigating yesterday businessman donald trump has it both ways blaming george w bush for invading the country in the first place and obama for pulling troops out in 2011 the war should have never happened he told fox news earlier this year once it did happen you should have left the troops in it s really a double fault in iowa where bush polled seventh in a cnn orc poll released this week there are some republicans who appreciate his approach and think his dynastic lineage is a positive attribute he s going to be our man because he s presidential he knows what s going on said belinda schlueter a 56 year old homemaker he comes from a family that actually knows what the country s all about and how the office runs we need somebody there that knows what they re doing bush launched his discussions of national security tuesday in a speech at the ronald reagan library in simi valley calif he faulted obama and clinton for their blind haste to withdraw u s forces from iraq a premature decision and a fatal error that disrupted the fragile progress his brother helped forge in iraq he did not mention his brother s role in starting the process for withdrawal while there are about 3 500 u s support troops in iraq now more may well be needed bush said he endorsed deploying troops to work more closely with iraqi forces including as forward air spotters to help identify targets we do not need and our friends do not ask for a major commitment of american combat forces he said but we do need to convey that we are serious that we are determined to help local forces take back their country in syria he called for more active u s involvement in the brutal syrian civil war including a no fly zone and the expansion of safe zones in the country on thursday at a national security forum in davenport iowa he said iraq was fragile but secure when his brother left office in 2009 he added that the mission was accomplished in the way that there was security there and it was because of the heroic efforts of the men and women in the united states military that it was so that answer immediately prompted comparisons to george w bush s 2003 mission accomplished speech on the deck of a navy carrier that critics say prematurely declared the end of the iraqi military campaign at the forum jeb bush would not say for certain whether he would preserve the executive order obama signed banning enhanced interrogation later thursday he told reporters that he would not rule out using waterboarding during interrogations of terrorism suspects former house intelligence committee chairman mike rogers r mich whose group hosted the forum credited bush with presenting the most nuanced approach to a really hard problem op ed to defeat the islamic state the u s will have to go big rogers who is neutral in the gop primary contests said campaigns now are so tapped in to 140 characters and twitter it s very difficult to have a thoughtful conversation about national security peter feaver who advised george w bush on iraq applauded bush for delivering a detailed speech and suggested he represented views advocated by serious democrats and republicans he pointed to a recent washington post op ed co written by mich le flournoy obama s former undersecretary of defense for policy who has been touted as a possible defense secretary for clinton writing with richard fontaine a former foreign policy adviser to sen john mccain r ariz flournoy advocated a series of proposals similar to what bush called for to provide more military aid to sunni tribes and the kurdish peshmerga in iraq to embed more special operations forces with iraqi security forces to deploy forward air controllers to identify targets and to build a stronger global campaign against the islamic state after parrying questions lobbed at him by iowans bush donned a red apron and flipped pork chops with iowa gov terry branstad r carl owens a hog farmer stood off to the side taking in the scene i don t know if he s like his brother and dad or not said owens 59 i wasn t too happy with them mr bush the last president look at the mess he got the united states into over there where we shouldn t have been kind of like the vietnam war we shouldn t have been there o keefe reported from washington sean sullivan in iowa contributed to this report o keefe reported from washington sean sullivan in iowa contributed to this
