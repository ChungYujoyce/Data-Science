advertisement by kevin roose and keith collins oct 18 2018 after president trump s popularity on social media helped propel him to an upset victory in 2016 democrats vowed to catch up two years later their efforts appear to be paying off a new york times analysis of data from the facebook and instagram accounts of hundreds of candidates in next month s midterm elections reveals that democrats and especially democrats running for house seats enjoy a sizable national lead in engagement on the two influential platforms in most house races democrats had more facebook interactions than their opponents minnesota s 8th district the republican running for this open seat had 3 300 more interactions on facebook than his opponent outlined circles indicate the most competitive races wisconsin s 1st district the democrat running for speaker paul d ryan s open seat in wisconsin had 318 000 more interactions florida s 27th district the republican running for this district s open seat had 10 000

000 more facebook interactions than opponent but the analysis of the engagement data which includes all non advertising content also shows that republicans in many closely contested races for senate and governor are faring better on facebook than their democratic challengers the data collected from more than 53 000 posts by more than 1 100 accounts reflects a month s worth of social media activity by nearly all of the republican and democratic candidates running for house senate or governor this year the data which covers 30 days ending oct 15 was gathered using a facebook owned tool called crowdtangle the tool counts the number of times users comment on react to or share a user s posts a measure of popularity known as total interactions the data includes public posts made by candidates on facebook and instagram it does not include paid ads unless those ads began as organic non paid posts that were subsequently boosted using facebook s advertising tools it also does not include activity on private accounts or posts made visible only to specific groups of followers in instances where candidates had an official government account as well as a campaign account both accounts were included in the calculations in some instances politicians who are independent but who caucus with democrats or republicans were included on those parties lists together the data amounts to a revealing picture of how those candidates messages are resonating with a digital audience and how social media activity both mirrors and departs from more traditional polling methods it also shows that democrats often dominate the conversation on instagram but republican candidates are finding their biggest audiences on facebook the largest and most influential social network measuring total interactions on social media is an imperfect way to gauge a candidate s electoral chances in part because it does not distinguish between types of engagement a negative comment left on a republican candidate s page by an angry democrat would still count as an interaction for example in addition it does not account for the fact that some candidates have more followers than others but social media engagement can be a crude measure of popularity and a bellwether of shifts in public opinion that often turn up in polls days or weeks later in 2016 many polls and pundits gave mr trump little chance of winning but his performance on facebook was soaring bolstered by millions of dollars in targeted advertising his digital campaign director brad parscale later credited facebook s scale and influence with his victory as some republican lawmakers accuse facebook of anti conservative bias the party s candidates are still intensely interested in using it to get elected even the most tech skeptical candidates have recognized that when it comes to modern political campaigning there is no avoiding facebook facebook is the most widespread platform and for campaigns it s like broadcast television said tim lim a democratic digital consultant you have so much reach and so many ad units and probably more eyeballs than anywhere else at the national level democrats on facebook and instagram appear to be winning the battle for social media supremacy in a landslide interactions with posts on candidates facebook pages over the 30 day period senate candidates 10m democrats

senate candidates 10m democrats republicans 2 2m house candidates 3 5m democrats republicans 1 5m gubernatorial candidates 1 6m democrats republicans 1 7m democrats running for house senate and governor s seats in this fall s elections received a combined 15 1 million interactions on facebook in the 30 day period roughly three times the 5 4 million interactions received by republican candidates some of the democrats social media gains can be attributed to a well organized online resistance movement an influx of small dollar donations has given democrats a large fund raising lead which has allowed them to spend more on digital campaigning and advertising a surge in involvement from organizations like tech for campaigns which has mobilized nearly 10 000 volunteers from the tech industry to help democratic campaigns use digital tools has also helped jonathan strauss a former advisor to democratic campaigns who is now head of product at swing left said that investments made by democrats after mr trump s election were paying dividends i don t want to jinx anything but we re definitely doing a lot better than 2016 mr strauss said democrats national success on social media may not translate to the blue wave many liberals are hoping for in november that s because much of the left s firepower is concentrated among a few of its high profile candidates namely senators bernie sanders of vermont elizabeth warren of massachusetts and the texas senate candidate beto o rourke who has more than 600 000 followers on facebook and twitter and more than 250 000 on instagram

this year during the 30 day period mr sanders ms warren and mr o rourke accounted for 86 percent of democratic senate candidates facebook interactions and 92 percent of their instagram interactions if you strip away those three democrats and their challengers the left s social media advantage in senate races virtually disappears excluding mr sanders ms warren mr o rourke and their challengers democrats and republicans are essentially tied with democrats getting only about 8 percent more facebook interactions over the 30 day period part of the popularity of mr sanders ms warren and mr o rourke on social media is their political personas which are punchy passionate and tailor made to resonate with fired up progressive audiences online they also have dedicated digital staff members and sophisticated tools to create custom content and test various messages for impact smaller campaigns often have fewer resources devoted to digital campaigning and few have captured the attention of huge online audiences we only have one beto o rourke said mr lim the democratic consultant in reality we should have 20 beto o rourkes in addition to revealing which candidates are finding the biggest audiences online the data also hints at the partisan balance of each network interactions with posts on candidates instagram accounts over the 30 day period senate candidates democrats 5 4m

past 30 days the number of interactions on democrats instagram accounts dwarfed those on republican accounts these interactions were again led by mr sanders ms warren and mr o rourke whose posts received a combined 5 2 million favorites and comments in the past 30 days the political tilt of platforms reflects the demographics of the people who use them according to the pew research center facebook is used by 65 percent of americans over 50 and by 58 percent of rural users and 60 percent of users with a high school degree or less all groups that often lean more conservative instagram by contrast is most popular with users between ages 18 and 29 who tend to vote for democrats of course not all midterm races matter equally the social media activity in races rated as toss ups by the

by cook political report democratic candidates received more interactions than their republican opponents in 23 of them candidates from both parties appear to have benefited from the late september fervor surrounding the contentious confirmation of brett m kavanaugh which galvanized conservatives in his favor and created a surge in left wing support for christine blasey ford who accused justice kavanaugh of sexual assault but republicans in close races appear to have benefited slightly more from a kavanaugh bump than democrats in indiana s senate race mike braun the republican running against the incumbent democrat joe donnelly was trailing mr donnelly in facebook interactions for the two weeks leading up to sept 27 the day that dr blasey testified in front of the senate judiciary

nine most competitive senate races interactions on facebook for republicans rose by 94 percent during the week of sept 30 interactions for democrats in those races remained flat political strategists disagree about the importance of social media popularity some think it amounts to a kind of real time voter sentiment index while others play it down as at most one piece of a successful campaign retweets don t vote mr strauss of swing left said all of this social engagement is really just a proxy for the results that matter which is what happens at the polls on nov 6 for republicans who are worried about a wave of progressive enthusiasm sweeping democrats to victory though the data from swing district social media accounts may be comforting the democrats are constantly saying oh there s this huge sea of angry democratic voters and they re ready to erupt said rory mcshane a republican digital strategist there s just as much if not more enthusiasm on the republican side and that s seen by how much these people are doing online advertisement
