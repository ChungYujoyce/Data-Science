the big idea shaking up his campaign once again donald trump has decided to let trump be trump the republican nominee knows he s losing congenitally unable to take personal responsibility he blames his slide in the polls on the people who have prodded him to act presidential and wage a more traditional campaign in a 5 38 a m press release trump announced that stephen bannon who got rich on wall street but has never worked on a race before will take a leave of absence from running breitbart com to become the campaign s chief executive pollster kellyanne conway who worked for ted cruz s super pac during the primaries but has been friendly with trump for years will become campaign manager paul manafort will retain his titles as campaign chairman and chief strategist but trump advisers told robert costa overnight that his status has diminished internally due to the candidate s unhappiness and restlessness in recent weeks the aides told costa that trump has grown to feel boxed in and controlled by people who barely know him trump plans to redouble his focus on holding big rallies and doing lots of tv hits he ll also more aggressively attack hillary clinton to the extent that s possible and he ll reembrace his role as an outsider making less of an effort to be nice to gop graybeards during the primaries when trump was winning then campaign manager corey lewandowski always said let trump be trump he now wants to get back to that type of campaign culture the moves send a signal perhaps more clearly than ever that the real estate magnateintends to finish this race on his own terms with friends who share his instincts at his side costa writes this is another proof point that trump is not trying to run the kind of serious campaign that can actually win the presidency that s why it will frighten the gop establishment scare off some mainstream donors who have been playing footsie with the billionaire and push congressional leaders like mitch mcconnell a little closer to cutting trump loose maybe even before labor day bannon s site single mindedly went after paul ryan in the run up to his primary both of the newlyelevated advisers are conservative populists who will never discourage trump from following his id it s hard for a 70 year old man to change his ways especially this one donald s id demands instant gratification more than most people s and he s long struggled to control his impulsiveness the shake up also suggests that trump realizes manafort s ukraine connections have become problematic and undercut the credibility of his attacks on the clinton foundation the associated press reports this morning that trump s campaign chairman helped a pro russian political party in ukraine secretly route at least 2 2 million to two prominent washington lobbying firms the project was structured in ways that obscured the foreign party s efforts to influence u s policy jeff horwitz and desmond butler report the revelation was described to the ap by people directly knowledgeable about the effort under federal law u s lobbyists must tell the justice department if they represent foreign leaders or their political parties a violation is a felony and can result in up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 250 000 read the whole story here in wisconsin last night trump announced that he would require senior officials in his administration to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office or from any entity tied to a foreign government another important storyline breitbart news has long been trump s pravda and he just put the guy who runs the site in charge of his campaign staff amusingly trump s press release this morning cites a somewhat unflattering 2015 profile from bloomberg businessweek that calls bannon the most dangerous political operative in america the release says he will oversee the campaign staff and operations in addition to strategic oversight of major campaign initiatives recall that breitbart took the side of the trump campaign after lewandowski grabbed the arm of one of its reporters he then lied about it until surveillance footage undercut his story that reporter michelle fields subsequently left and several employees resigned in protest roger ailes the pugilistic and recently ousted founder of fox news is also reportedly moving closer to the inner circle the new york times reports that ailes still embroiled in a sexual harrassment scandal is acting as a presidential debate adviser to trump as he prepares to face off against clinton two sources said mr ailes s role could extend beyond the debates maggie haberman and ashley parker report for mr ailes being connected with mr trump s campaign could be a form of redemption after he was pushed out of the powerful network that he helped build the trump campaign naturally publicly denies that ailes has any role on the campaign per jose delreal trump is cozying up to ailes and bannon after months of being unable to hire a level talent the smartest and most ambitious operatives know that having his name on their resume will probably become a scarlet letter that may doom their future prospects politico s katie glueck writes that top republicans in several critical battleground states say at best they ve never heard of trump s state directors or have only limited familiarity with them and at worst they know them and question their ability to do the job three telling examples from katie s piece trump offered a revealing window into his management style when he saidin 2007 that you should never hire people who are smarter than you you have to keep great people around you trump told cnbc you always have to be on top of them and you have to be smarter than they are i hear so many times oh i want my people to be smarter than i am it s a lot of crap you want to be smarter than your people if possible an important reminder of how little time trump has to right the ship voting actually starts in less than six weeks on sept 23 in minnesota and south dakota the first of some 35 states and the district of columbia that

per the wall street journal today trump will receive his first classified intelligence briefing in a scif at the fbi s new york field office he plans to bring new jersey gov chris christie and former defense intelligence agency chief michael flynn with him career staffers from the office of the director of national intelligence will be leading the briefing which is expected to cover major threats and emerging concerns around the world abc news reports like trump flynn has advocated forging closer ties with russia dana priest and greg miller note in their excellent profile of the retired

most powerful espionage tools created by the nsa s most elite group of hackers have mysteriously appeared online ellen nakashima reports a development that could pose severe consequences for the agency s operations and government security the file contained 300 megabytes of information including several exploits or tools for taking control of firewalls in order to control a network the disclosure of the file means that at least one other party possibly another country s spy agency has had access to the same hacking tools used by the nsa and could deploy them against organizations that are using vulnerable routers and firewalls it might also see what the nsa is targeting and spying on former nsa personnel who worked in the agency s division said the file appeared to be legitimate without a doubt they re the keys to the kingdom said one former employee the stuff you re talking about would undermine the security of a lot of major government and corporate networks both

free labor he told reporters marissa payne the daily hillary the fbi forcefully defended its decision not to criminally charge clinton for her use of a private email server at the state department outlining their rationale in a letter to house oversight committee lawmakers from matt zapotosky and karoun demirjian fbi director james comey announced in early july that he was recommending clinton not be charged and the letter largely repeated statements he had made previously in public but it also notably seemed to take aim at some ongoing conservative criticisms of clinton particularly that she was negligent in her handling of classified information and thus deserving of criminal charges jason herring who directs the fbi s office of congressional affairs wrote that someone else who engaged in the type of conduct of which clinton was accused might face severe administrative consequences and the fbi was in the process of providing relevant information to other government agencies but herring also asserted that investigators found no evidence clinton intended to mishandle classified information noting that even three emails marked as classified did not originate with her and that state had determined two of them did not contain classified information read the four page letter here the fbi s letter to the judiciary committee makes clear this is much ado about nothing senate intelligence committee ranking member dianne feinstein d calif who released the letter said in a statement last night house oversight chair jason chaffetz said the documents provided by the fbi yesterday left him unpersuaded and while members of his committee would were not investigating the investigators they were trying to figure out what happened so that we can try to solve it we got to make sure this never ever happens again chaffetz said overplaying their hand trump adviser al baldasaro doubled down on hiscommentthat clinton should be shot for treason for using aprivate email server the liberal media took what i said and went against the law and the constitution and ran with it and they said that i wanted her assassinated which i never did baldasaro said i said i spoke as a veteran and she should be shot in a firing squad for treason masslive com for the first time the clinton campaign pushed back against conspiracy theories from the fever swamps of the right that her health is frail the evening press release included a statement from the former secretary of state s doctor lisa bardack who maintained that she is in excellent health and that documents circulating online under her name are fake while it is dismaying to see the republican nominee for president push deranged conspiracy theories in a foreign policy speech it s no longer surprising said jennifer palmieri the campaign s communications director trump is simply parroting lies based on fabricated documents promoted by roger stone and his right wing allies david weigel hillary won the endorsement

wins five months after winning nomination to the supreme court and becoming the object of a pitched partisan battle garland now finds himself in a surprising position irrelevance mike debonis reports the name of the mild mannered appeals court judge has been almost entirely absent from the campaign trail if she wins clinton will face pressure from her party s left wing to select someone younger or more liberal than garland standing by obama s man could alienate liberal democrats including those who backed sen bernie sanders still others remain convinced she will stand by her support of garland i would think that she and all the people around her would say why do we need to rock the boat here let s get him confirmed quickly and move on to the next one whenever that comes senate minority

workers jose a delreal reports the 64 person committee will meet regularly according to the campaign and advise the gop presidential nominee on food production issues but several of those listed seem to be opposed to trump s calls for mass deportation and strongly supported the comprehensive immigration reform package passed by the senate in 2013 immigrant labor is a bedrock of the agriculture industry in the united states many members of the newly formed committee have argued and a shortage in the already scant agriculture labor pool would raise consumer prices on fox news trump said his

campaigns mirror the fault lines of a divided nation new york times trump casinos tax debt was 30 million then christie took office by russ buettner by the time chris christie became governor of new jersey the state s auditors and lawyers had been battling for several years to collect long overdue taxes owed by trump s casinos the total with interest had grown to almost 30 million the state had doggedly pursued the matter through two of the casinos bankruptcy cases and even accused the company led by mr trump of filing false reports with state casino regulators about the amount of taxes it had paid but the year after christie took office the tone of the litigation shifted the state entertained settlement offers and in december 2011 the state agreed to accept just 5 million roughly 17 cents on the dollar of what auditors said the casinos owed a coincidence mr christie was close to the attorney general at the time paula t dow whom he had appointed and who previously worked for him a
