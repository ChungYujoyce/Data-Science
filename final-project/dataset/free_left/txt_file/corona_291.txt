safety amazon and target were the focus of renewed labor protests over the health risks of working during a pandemic transcript from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily michigan has been one of the most aggressive states when it comes to taking steps to combat the coronavirus bans on all gatherings outside a single household travel to in state vacation homes and the use of motorboats michigan s restrictions on its citizens movements have been at the center of a national debate about public health versus economic survival protests in michigan are growing because the governor democrat gretchen whitmer has told us citizens they can t leave the city and stay in their summer homes don t buy paint don t buy roses don t buy i mean she s got all these crazy things today a conversation with the governor who ordered those restrictions and a demonstrator who is protesting them it s wednesday april 29 so i just want to start by asking you to introduce yourself your name and where you re talking to us from my name is phillip campbell and i m coming to you from jackson county michigan which is about an hour west of detroit and about an hour away from the capital of lansing and how long have you lived there i ve been here in this particular location for five years but i m a born and raised michigander my whole life and did you say how old you are yeah 39 i m turning 40 in june i had a massive party planned i was inviting everyone i know and now i just don t know what s happening with that so when you say massive how massive i invited 1 000 people so we were going to be laughs i have five acres and i was going to rent port a johns and we were going to camp and it was going to be a multi day bash you know it turns out you re very popular too laughs well i ve made a lot of friends over the years so tell me about what you do for a living i m the vice president of a pest and wildlife control company we are the ones you call if you wake up at 1 00 a m and there s a bat flying around your kid s bedroom and you need somebody to go get it we will climb on your roof and pull down the hornet s nest we will take care of the mice in your basement we ll do this sort of work mm hm we have about 30 employees i ve been with the company for about 10 years now i think i m one of the most senior employees there we started when we were in the basement of the owner s house and now we have a very large industrial building with a depot and a shop so it s been cool to see that grow over the years so at this point how would you describe the company and its success i mean i think we re on the threshold of breaking through to the next level of growth we re grossing about 3 million a year wow just this year we re able to for the first time provide health benefits for our employees so we ve been working towards that for a long time trying to get to where we have the sort of revenue and the growth that we could take on those costs which are not insignificant you know we like to think that we re one of the companies or industries that can still offer regular old joes without a college education a very decent middle class livelihood with insurance benefits things like that mm hm the majority of technicians are what i would just call blue collar people you know they like to hunt they fish they go out on the lake on the weekends and drink beer on their pontoons and listen to music and just regular old folks you know mm hm and what kind of a living do the people generally make i mean many of the people in our company they provide for their families you know they re the breadwinner you know a new technician like starting might make 35 mm hm and then a technician who s been with us for a while and knows what he s doing he can make in the high 50s or 60s so with the 30 employees we have we feed about 100 mouths with their children and families so we feel responsible for about 100 people s well being and what did the first michigan lockdown the one ordered by governor whitmer what did it mean for your pest control business her order did not exempt us the text of the order itself it did not make an exemption for wildlife control pest control and we were preparing to shut down and then i noticed that it said for its definition of essential services for further clarification see this document by the department of homeland security and we found that we were allowed to stay open got it but very quickly after that we had to furlough a couple people after that because even though we were allowed to stay open our customer base many of them aren t working so if your customers aren t working they re not spending money and it doesn t really matter if you re open if all the people you serve aren t working you know what i mean right i don t want to pry too much but if you were bringing in i think you said almost 3 million a year in revenue before this what did it start to look like once the lockdown was in place and the calls from customers began to taper off at first it was a 50 percent drop wow again this is for a company that was allowed to stay open right and then around this time the second shutdown order came in which was the one that everybody started protesting about tell me what you mean yeah the second shutdown order just ramped down on the first this was the one that went in and shut particular sections of stores that were still open so like it said you can t buy paint products you can t buy gardening products because what was happening is people thinking ok i got to stay home i might as well work on my house you know so a lot of those people were going to home depot were going to whatever to get their supplies and then the governor said no you can t get that stuff so this was the order that said you can t go out on a lake by yourself in your boat in your private lake if the boat has a motor but if it doesn t have a motor you can go things that seemed a lot more arbitrary the one that said you can t have someone come mow your lawn even though they pull up in a truck they drive the lawnmower off they don t touch you they don t go into your house it s just one guy mowing your lawn you know things that people started thinking like the economy s already in freefall is it really necessary to go this far with it from my own experience if the economy takes a dump and we can t get back to where we were we have to cut their health insurance or we re going to have to lay people off we re going to take other measures to stay afloat i don t know what we re going to have to do i don t want to hypothesize i don t want my employees to listen to this and be like what did you say is going to happen i don t know we re going to have do something we can t just suddenly take a 30 percent to 50 percent decline that s huge what if you got a 50 percent pay cut it would affect your life and so i m thinking about the ripple effect we take a 30 percent to 50 percent drop our employees take a dip maybe they can t afford to pay their debts maybe they can t afford to pay their own mortgages or whatever i don t know i haven t assessed the financial situation of each of my employees but i guess what i am frustrated about and i don t want to minimize the risk of covid 19 or the people who ve had it but as someone who s worked for 10 years in this business trying to build it up get it to where it is i m frustrated with the attitude of some people that we can just shut it off for a while and then just turn it back on when everything s safe and just pick up where we left off like no that s not how business works that s certainly not how small business works if you take a big enough hit it s hard to recover from it you know so i m curious when you first hear about the possibility of a public demonstration a protest in michigan of these lockdown rules i saw an event on social media i think or i saw people talking about it like hey let s go down to lansing and protest so the owner and i work s been slow so we said hey we got time let s drive down to lansing on thursday the way i understood it we were going to drive by the capitol and honk our horn basically and what was that honked horn going to mean the honked horn was going to mean like we are workers and we want the freedom for people to be able to work please consider opening things back up a little more the capitol in lansing it s on a loop so you drive around in like a circle around the capitol so i thought that all the traffic would come in we d kind of loop around and we d honk and then we d go back home you know but they were anticipating a certain amount of people i think 10 times more than they anticipated showed up so it took us two hours to get to lansing we got in lansing and then we were just michael it was a traffic jam that s what it was it was just a big traf it was like an organized traffic jam but what did it feel like to be in that traffic jam because it s a particular kind of traffic jam with like minded people there to protest something it was really neat it was nice to not feel so alone because i was really sick of people on social media telling me i m selfish because i don t want the company i helped build for 10 years to just collapse who s calling you selfish do you feel like oh just people on social media my friends people in my broader circle you know not people i m necessarily close to but i d say i lost some friends over this honestly when the governor shut the economy down i said this is going to be very hard on businesses and this is going to be very hard on us and a lot of people s response seemed to be like what do you want people to die or something you know and it kind of degenerated into like either you want people to die or you hate my business and stuff like that and i was really glad because i was starting to feel kind of isolated to see a solidarity of so many other michiganders who were similarly frustrated at the situation afterwards when i got home i saw there was a lot of people with a lot of trump stuff and i was kind of thinking like no this isn t political don t make it into a political thing because this isn t about the governor happens to be a democrat or a woman or something because i would have gone down there if it was a republican you know it wasn t about her party affiliation so i was frustrated what did you make of the flavor of the protest it seems like you didn t see this yourself in your car but as you ve hinted there were strong strains of libertarianism and conservatism and pro trump posters as well as people with guns as well as some you know some more vulgar and extreme sentiments some people compared governor whitmer to hitler oh like governor whitler laughs oh i don t know i think that s just juvenile i mean i think it s pretty juvenile in public discourse when the only thing you go to is compare your opponent to hitler i wish it wouldn t have been so much anti whitmer because this isn t about like governor whitmer the person you know i wish that it would have been more on point and focused about let me work you know i wonder where you fall in the political spectrum did you vote for trump did you vote for whitmer and how did your political views apply to this event my political views didn t apply to this event really at all you know like i would ve been there if this was a republican i did vote for trump i don t particularly think he s doing that great of a job so i m not a gung ho trump supporter i didn t vote for whitmer but i didn t like the guy running against her either so you re saying you re not seeing this crisis or the lockdowns through a political lens no no not at all not at all the little match between president trump and governor whitmer is making it more political when trump tweets liberate michigan when he refers to her as that woman from michigan obviously that sets governor whitmer up as a foil against president trump which politicizes it when rumors start coming out that biden wants to consider her as v p material that politicizes it i really liked when i was there that it simply seemed like a spontaneous expression of working class frustration phil i want to tick through what your governor said when she began this process of locking down the state and basically enforcing social distancing and here s what she said the only tool we have to fight the virus at this moment and to support our health care system is to give them the opportunity by buying some time yeah and she went on to say without aggressive measures more people will get sick more people will die and our economy will suffer longer and in her telling the disease spreads if people are out there if people aren t out there the disease doesn t spread so she is making the case in the beginning that these sacrifices are required to prevent a system overload what do you think of that well we were willing to go along with that because we were all expecting this huge crunch on all our hospitals we were worried about not enough beds not enough ventilators but the fact is the curve is flattened now we now have hospitals they re not overwhelmed anymore so what we re saying is that was all well and good but now we can start to open up again because we flattened the curve even if infections go back up at this point as i grant they could if we start being more economically active it seems highly unlikely given all the empty hospitals that were going to get to another crush where we don t have enough beds or something like that so i want to make sure i understand what you re saying when you talk about where things are in michigan the times has maps about where the virus is in each state and just pulling this up michigan has about 38 000 infections and there s been about 3 300 deaths yeah we re the third highest state i think so when you talk about your frustrations with the different phases of this lockdown how do you square it with those numbers well i square it because my understanding is that the lockdown wasn t supposed to be like we re going to lockdown until this goes away what we were told was that this lockdown was to distribute those amount of cases over a longer period of time so that the health system doesn t get overwhelmed so i look at the total number of deaths and infections and say ok this thing is here to stay whether we like it or not the hospitals do have the ability to take people in so it seems like to me that the goal has been met the goal is not to it sounds like you re saying that if we assume that the measures taken so far have flattened the curve to some degree in michigan that you re willing to accept the risks of restarting the economy even if that means that the curve might go up a little bit that you think that so far the measures taken have done enough to merit that kind of experimentation with essentially taking the risk of reopening i think so and again i m not saying just a full like the economy isn t a switch you just turn it on everybody comes back out you know but i think people who want to work and can work in a way that is maintaining safe protocols i think they should be able to because the thing is what i would like people to understand is that it s not like either we stay home and stay safe or we all get the coronavirus and die it s like staying home and nobody working has its own inherent risks and dangers and devastation that s going to come when i talk about the economy i m not saying i m worried about the stock market or the financial sector i m talking about the ability of the average person to provide sustenance for himself and one s family so we could have negative outcomes because of the shutdown not because of covid negative outcomes that dwarf covid mm hm so we re now talking on monday april 27 and that protest was about two weeks ago yeah and i m curious if you think that protest which was one of the very first protests had any kind of impact yeah i think it did i mean this is just me kind of blue skying this but i think it let her see that she only had a limited amount of political capital that she could keep carrying this out indefinitely she started to say we ll let lawn service in again we ll let various things start she rolled back some of the more in your mind problematic restrictions yeah she rolled back some of the more problematic restrictions and she started talking about an end game you know so in that respect i think it was helpful i think it got the message across we plan to talk to governor whitmer and i wonder what you most want to communicate to her about what you think she may not understand what she might not be getting in this moment well first i would say to her americans are responsible people we re creative people tell us what social distancing guidelines you think we should be maintaining when we re out there and let us find a way to do it if you think we need to be six or seven feet apart if you think we shouldn t have more than six people in a room give us a safe paradigm of personal behavior and let us work within it don t lock us down and say that we can t provide for ourselves that s the most basic human right is to provide for your own well being just let us find some way to work well phil thank you very much we really appreciate your time yeah thank you i was very happy to be with you today we ll be right back hi there hi governor whitmer it s michael barbaro how are you i m doing all right how are you doing i m doing great where are you right now that looks like it might be home yes yes i m at the governor s residence in one of the rooms is that a sign of you that says the gov it s a beer that was named after me so yes that s the poster and the beer is called the gov yep is that any good it is pretty good it s an indian pale ale laughs so governor over the past few weeks it feels like a lot of people have learned your name but i sense a lot of americans a lot of our listeners don t know all that much about you and how it is you became the governor of michigan so in brief what is that story you know i m a lifelong michigander i ve lived here my whole life i was brought up in a household with a father who was kind of a republican a mother who was kind of a democrat i decided to run for governor after spending some time practicing law and teaching and i did a stint as a prosecutor in my hometown but i think that part of my nature is when i see a problem and i don t see the right people there to fix it i just kind of want to jump in and do it the tagline of the campaign was fix the damn roads and it wasn t because it was poll tested it s how everyone in the state talks about their frustration with infrastructure that hasn t been attended to properly for a long period of time and it is the most visceral daily reminder of government that s not getting the fundamentals right mm hm that was kind of the call to action and i won by almost 10 points after donald trump had won my state by less than 11 000 votes just two years before i think because we really were trying to rally around getting the fundamentals right right so it s fair to say that you did not run in that race for governor as somebody who would become a polarizing and partisan figure in a national debate over the future of the american economy correct laughs to the contrary i went out of my way to not go down that path and so to be right here in this moment in the midst of a global pandemic to be trying to pull people together where things have gotten so polarized in ways that i think many people would say they couldn t have ever predicted if they were being honest is kind of surreal so let s talk about how that happened how you have gotten to this point where there s so much polarization over your decision making as the pandemic unfolds soon enough you begin imposing restrictions on the movement of michigan residents and what feels like a pretty standard version of a lockdown yes but then at a certain point you introduce a second wave of restrictions that are a little bit different right banning travel to second homes banning motor boating limiting what kind of non essential goods stores can sell and governor what was your thinking there with that second wave of restrictions so what we knew at the time was that covid 19 was ravaging southeast michigan mm hm we also know that we have an incredibly high death count compared to our population 10th largest population but the third highest number of positive cases and number of deaths we also know that covid 19 doesn t recognize boundaries of a county that this is a disease that is highly communicable there are studies that will tell you covid 19 can stay active and communicable for 72 hours on a stainless steel surface and so as the weather starts to warm up here in michigan we know people want to head north and go to the lake mm hm one of the lakes we got lots of beautiful freshwater lakes and the more people that are on the road the more likely covid 19 will be spread at a gas station i often would invoke the visual of that gas pump so you think about all the nurses and doctors and people that have to touch that gas pump because they re going out to get groceries or they re going out to pick up medication the more people that are on the road the more likely covid 19 spreads to other parts of the state too and that s why these restrictions made sense so your thinking was let s shut down anything that might contribute to the spread and let s make sure that people in the most populous parts of michigan don t end up basically exporting it to less populous parts of the state where outdoor activities are concentrated and let s do this even if it might seem a little bit extreme let s shut down what s not life sustaining activity that was the thought process of why we went more aggressive than some other states so you think those second wave measures were the right call i do governor the protests that broke out in your state i m sure you were aware of them because you re in lansing protesters very much by design came to you did you sympathize at all with the protesters who said that they found these restrictions to be too onerous to be unfair to be in their minds undemocratic i ll say this i respect people s right to disagree with me i do and i will defend anyone s right to say what they want to say their ability and right to do that is absolutely something that i have a great deal of respect for hm the fact of the matter is congregation is the biggest threat to containing covid 19 because when people come from all different parts of the state congregate don t observe c d c best practices and then go back to all parts of the state that s precisely what we re hoping to avoid in terms of continuous transmission and growth in other parts of michigan mm hm but when you look at these protests there were a variety of different political groups that came together it had a rally feel to it it was right outside the office i saw i watched a bit of it people were open carrying automatic rifles there were demonstrations anti choice demonstrations they re displaying confederate flags and nazi symbolism and i think very partisan rhetoric was more about a political statement rather than a statement of the sacrifices that i ve asked people to make well yesterday governor i spoke with a man who was at that protest he stayed in his car his name was phil campbell he manages a kind of moderate sized business that he says is suffering right now under these restrictions and he said that he didn t arrive as a partisan that he would have gone to lansing and protested whether you were a democrat or a republican and in his mind the shutdown is creating its own health and safety costs right he says his employees may soon lose their health insurance because business is suffering so much they can t afford to provide it much longer i mean what do you say to someone like that who says this is not about politics this is not about you being a democrat this is not about the tea party this is about a view that this is just not right the reality is unrestrained activity would have made what was a hard time a catastrophe that would have taken a lot longer to start to re engage from mm hm what our modeling told us we would have 220 000 people who would need to be hospitalized this week we have 3 000 people who are hospitalized it s worked and the vast majority of people are doing their part and doing the right thing it hasn t been easy but they ve stepped up to do it and we ve saved lives in the process this gentleman i spoke with phil the protester his ultimate message and it was directed very much at you as governor is trust us let us start to go back to work not like a band aid being ripped off but gradually and trust us to be able to work and follow social distancing guidelines and i think his question to you would be do you trust michiganders to do that i am so inspired by what the people of this state have done in this crisis they ve stepped up they ve made sacrifices i have incredible faith and confidence in the people of the state but we have a duty to make sure that we get this right mm hm and it s got to be guided by the best medical experts as well as business leaders and that s what we re working to do i have a council of business leaders and medical leaders who are helping us determine how do we start to re engage our economy in a way that avoids a second wave because whether phil and i agree on how quickly that should be done or not i think we can both agree i hope so that none of us ever wants to do this again you know in states that are moving some would say too fast one of the issues that small business is confronting is that the public is not confident that it s safe to re engage and so they ve lifted the protections for small business while you re in a crisis and yet the public s not coming out to patronize and that could be even worse for small business so what we want to do is get it right and that means working with the business community and public health and turning up the dial together so we don t have to turn it back well let s talk about how it is that you get it right when it comes to reopening and how you re thinking about that i mean is there a data set you re looking at is there a set of measurements you re monitoring and i m curious and i m sure lots of people michigan are too what s the thing or things that trigger the reopening so we ve started to reengage we are looking of course at rolling averages on hospitalizations we are looking at our ability to ramp up testing we need to build out when it comes to tracing so that if someone does test positive for covid 19 that we re able to trace all their contacts and keep it from spreading i would also add that we in michigan are assessing different sectors of our economy for risk asking questions like is the work done in a region of our state that s been devastated by covid 19 or a region that has been untouched by covid 19 right does the type of work require that multiple people use the same instruments or machinery is the work done indoors or outdoors that makes a difference mm hm right one of the examples that i think phil gave was around this idea of is there a work that can be done that just feels fundamentally safer by nature that those might come back soon so you use the word feels feels safer laughs and i think that s interesting because what i want to make sure we do is go with data and make sure that as we are reengaging we re continually measuring i know phil doesn t want to be back in a stay home order in august and neither do i mm hm and so i want to get this right for him for his employees lawnscaping lawn care that is already permitted that was in our first wave that i announced on friday in this next one we could have construction that is often in big spaces outdoors with p p e and the protocols necessary that could be a lower risk one that we can mitigate the risk further through protocols around face masks or separators between workers who can t be six feet apart but can have plexiglass separators for instance and so all of these are pieces to starting to turn the dial up and what it looks like in waves you know we started by talking to you about the fact that when you first ran for governor it was as somebody literally talking about fixing the roads and fixing infrastructure in michigan and through these actions that you ve taken in response to the pandemic you have become a national figure a national democratic figure right you re whether you wanted to or not sparring with the president and whether it s fairly or unfairly you re now seen through a partisan lens as a partisan figure are you comfortable now in that role no laughs i m not i mean you know i was thrown into the national spotlight being criticized or attacked by the president of the united states i didn t ask for that i did not like it i didn t sleep really frankly because i was worried that this would preclude my ability to get the help that i need for michigan hm you fear that you might actually suffer some kind of retribution that might make it harder to get through this pandemic yeah and i think that that was a legitimate fear with some of the statements that have been made by the president yeah that if you re not nice you might not get the help you need and so i ve bent over backwards to try to smooth that over not throwing a punch back i would hate for anyone in michigan to not have the help they need because i m not popular with the president for some reason do you worry that with the divided state of this country some of your constituents will come away from this pandemic seeing your actions as partisan no matter what happens and no matter what your intentions i think that s the unfortunate reality that we live with i do think though that when we have gotten through this when we look back on it that we re going to be comfortable in the fact that the decisions that were made save lives mm hm the hard thing about public health is when you do it well you never know how many lives would have been lost otherwise mm hm but we can see it when you look at the curves where we were headed and where we are today that there s no question lives were saved there s no question that these actions made a difference and that s what centered everything that we ve done hm not the partisan stuff not the fear of that but the determination to do everything in our power to save lives and to keep our health care system working so that it s there when we all need it well governor whitmer i want to thank you very much for your time and i hope you re getting a little more sleep now laughs no but i ll sleep sometime thank you thank you we appreciate it we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today on tuesday the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the united states reached 1 million meaning that roughly one in every 330 americans has tested positive for the virus but the times reports that the actual number of infections is even higher since thousands of americans have never been tested because of a shortage of testing supplies and we had intended to come back next week it has been previously scheduled but once the capitol physician told us that it was not a proper for us to do that in the interest of not only members and staff but the custodians the people who maintain the capitol the press who cover us the staff of the actual legislative chamber there was no choice for us but to say we will put this off the house of representatives has canceled plans to call lawmakers back into session after members complained that returning to washington would pose an unnecessary health risk and set a bad example for the country the senate however is expected to reconvene in washington on monday finally jets flying in new york jets from the air force thunderbirds and the navy blue angels flew over the city on tuesday in a tribute to medical workers and first responders involved in fighting the pandemic jets flying the jets soared over the east river as well as the hudson and were cheered on by new yorkers who ventured outside to observe them flying over president trump has voiced support for protests against restrictions even as federal guidance urged americans to avoid large gatherings to help stem the spread of the virus the justice department has signaled that it might endorse court challenges pushing back against some rules by next week nearly half the states will have made moves toward reopening their economies at the same time portions of the country including much of the west coast and the northeast remain shuttered but the reopening comes as the number of cases continues to rise in many states known deaths from the virus surpassed 63 000 in the united states this week and as public health experts have warned that reopening too soon could lead to a devastating second wave gov jay inslee of washington said on friday that he was extending the state s stay at home order until at least the end of may i would like to tell you that you can make reservations on june 1 but i cannot he said and in new mexico gov michelle lujan grisham authorized a lockdown of the town of gallup on friday in an effort to curtail a surge in virus deaths that has the state s tribal nations on edge the navajo nation has been grappling with a severe outbreak as of thursday the tribal nation had reported a total of 2 141 cases and 71 confirmed deaths the navajo nation s president jonathan nez said he fully supported the lockdown order we have many members of the navajo nation that reside in gallup and many that travel in the area and their health and safety is always our top priority mr nez said a detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak with tables of the number of cases by county the food and drug administration on friday issued an emergency approval for the antiviral drug remdesivir as a treatment for patients with covid 19 the illness caused by the virus the approval formally called an emergency use authorization had been expected following modestly encouraging results from a federal trial announced on wednesday the trial found that patients receiving remdesivir recovered more quickly in 11 days versus 15 in a group receiving a placebo but the drug made by gilead sciences did not significantly reduce fatality rates speaking to reporters on friday the president announced the f d a approval and called it an important treatment for hospitalized coronavirus patients the president said that he was pleased that gilead had received its emergency authorization and you know what that is because that s been the hot thing in the papers and in the media for the last little while an important treatment for hospitalized coronavirus patients he said dr deborah l birx the coordinator of the virus task force said that the f d a approval of remdesivir really illustrates what can happen in such a short time noting how fast the approval followed the first known cases in the united states dr anthony s fauci the federal government s top expert on infectious diseases said earlier this week that the results were a very important proof of concept but not a knockout the white house is preventing dr fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases from testifying before the house next week a spokesman for the house appropriations committee said on friday top democrats on the panel had wanted dr fauci to testify as part of an in person hearing led by representative rosa delauro democrat of connecticut who oversees the subcommittee responsible for funding health labor and education agencies and programs but when the committee asked for dr fauci to appear the trump administration denied the request and the committee was told by an administration official that it was because of the white house according to evan hollander a spokesman for the house appropriations committee a white house spokesman defended the decision as aimed at keeping the administration focused on its response to the virus it is counterproductive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings said the spokesman judd deere we are committed to working with congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time the washington post first reported the white house s decision dr fauci one of the most visible faces of the administration s fight against the coronavirus has often quietly contradicted many of mr trump s statements on how the administration is handling the outbreak and how quickly the country will be able to recover but the white house has directed government health officials and scientists to coordinate all statements and public appearances with vice president mike pence s office in an effort to streamline the administration s messaging dr fauci told associates in february that he had been instructed not to say anything else without clearance but has become a media fixture as the toll of the pandemic has grown separately the president moved on friday to replace a top official at the department of health and human services who angered him with a report last month highlighting supply shortages and testing delays at hospitals during the pandemic this was the latest effort by mr trump against watchdog offices around his administration that have defied him transcript our past actions changed the past trajectory our present actions will determine the future trajectory it is that clear it is cause and effect you tell me what we do today i will tell you the number of people sick tomorrow we re going to have the schools remain closed for the rest of the year we re going to continue the distance learning programs schools have asked about summer school and whether we ll have attendance in schools for summer school that decision will be made by the end of this month again nobody can predict what the situation is going to be three four weeks from now so we re trying to stage decisions at intervals that give us the information but also enough time for people to make the preparations they need to make gov philip d murphy of new jersey reported another 311 deaths from the virus on friday it was a drop from thursday when the state reported 460 deaths state health officials explained on friday that the number of deaths reported on any given day includes many deaths that can go back weeks and are newly classified as virus related but it was the second straight day that new jersey reported more deaths than new york which has more than twice as many people on friday new york reported that 289 more people had died the first time the one day death toll fell below 300 since march 30 new hospitalizations for the virus in new york remained in the mid 900s for the fourth straight day a sign of a plateau that its governor found troubling mr murphy s announcement came as new jersey s state and county parks are set to reopen on saturday so are golf courses with extensive social distancing rules in place he said new jersey residents were being trusted with a big test this weekend and he urged people to wear masks and avoid knucklehead behavior with people ignoring social distancing in new york schools across the state will remain shuttered through the end of the school year its governor said friday confirming what other officials had previously said was inevitable he has said some parts of the state might be able to gradually reopen businesses on may 15 excluding new york city and the surrounding region hundreds of protesters converged on the illinois state capitol in springfield and in downtown chicago on friday demanding that gov j b pritzker lift the stay at home order that he extended until may 29 at the capitol demonstrators crowded beneath a statue of abraham lincoln and chanted open illinois most did not have face coverings and some wore make america great again hats the protest came on the heels of a similar demonstration in michigan on thursday where hundreds of people some of them armed converged on the state capitol in lansing to protest the state s stay at home orders in louisiana gov john bel edwards s decision to extend a stay at home order has also been met with an upswell of outrage and in california hundreds of people gathered in huntington beach on friday to protest against gov gavin newsom s directive to close beaches in orange county officials across the country are trying to strike a balance between prioritizing public health and stanching the economic devastation in some states the divide has become starkly partisan and increasingly rancorous michigan louisiana california and illinois are all run by democratic governors who have recently moved to extend stay at home orders all have faced pushback from republican state officials and protests against their orders have doubled as rallies for conservative causes the people of louisiana are about to revolt said danny mccormick a republican state representative who organized a rally scheduled for saturday outside of the governor s mansion some lawmakers there have been plotting to overturn the governor s order potentially leaving louisiana as the only state in the nation without an emergency declaration in place that would just be completely irresponsible and nonsensical mr edwards said at a news conference on thursday to be the only state in the nation without an emergency declaration in place for the public health emergency of covid 19 in illinois james marter a republican running for congress spoke at the rally in springfield and decried that liquor stores and marijuana shops remained open and that abortions continued we the people are losing our freedoms everyday at a blinding speed he said according to a video that was briefly posted on facebook by one of the rally s organizers and in california where a crowd gathered at huntington beach videos showed hundreds of people demonstrating mostly without masks waving american flags while chanting no more newsom polls show that a majority of americans support social distancing measures and some lonely demonstrators are trying to prove that point a lawyer in florida daniel w uhlfelder tried to sue gov ron desantis a republican to demand statewide beach closures he said he was planning to tour beaches in the panhandle in a grim reaper costume to draw attention to the risk of the virus and warn people away from the beaches there when senators converge on capitol hill for a new session next week there will not be enough coronavirus tests for all of them even though white house officials and staff members are well supplied dr brian p monahan the tight lipped doctor who attends to congress told senior republican officials on a private conference call on thursday that his office could not screen all 100 senators for the virus when they return on monday president trump and vice president mike pence are tested frequently and have often avoided masks in public aides who come into close contact with them are tested weekly according to officials familiar with the process the stark contrast between the testing haves at the white house and the have nots on capitol hill makes clear that mr trump s pronouncement that anybody that wants a test can get a test as he said in march is far from true although the rich and powerful are clearly favored not even all the powerful have equal access speaker nancy pelosi of california had not been tested as of friday representative kevin mccarthy of california the top house republican has but at the white house where he attended an event with the president last week senator chuck schumer of new york the democratic leader has not been tested aides for senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader would not say whether he had been tested this week after dr monahan warned the house of representatives that it might be risky to come back on monday as scheduled ms pelosi abandoned plans to do so the house will now return may 11 but mr mcconnell decided to bring the senate back into session on monday without sufficient diagnostic testing some senators feared that the capitol where senators are surrounded by aides and a vast support staff of food service workers custodians and other personnel would become a mini hot spot for the virus more than 150 workers on a construction project at a nuclear power facility in georgia have tested positive for the virus and absenteeism has increased dramatically according to documents and a spokesman for georgia power the utility company that is a part owner of the facility the facility plant vogtle is near waynesboro ga about 150 miles east of atlanta and has been in operation since 1987 it is in the middle of a multibillion dollar expansion that has been plagued with setbacks including construction problems cost overruns and the 2016 bankruptcy of westinghouse its lead contractor as of march the expansion employed more than 9 000 workers making it the largest construction project in the state according to north america s building trades unions which represents many of the vogtle workers but after concerns about the spread of the virus mounted in recent weeks the plant s owners reduced the work force on the expansion project by 20 percent of the 171 workers found to have the virus 90 are active confirmed positive cases and 81 are workers who recovered and are available to return to work john kraft the spokesman for georgia power said in an email late thursday mr kraft said that 439 workers tested negative and that 48 were awaiting test results the owners learned of the first worker to test positive on april 4 mr kraft said around that time some workers told a local tv station that they were concerned that not enough was being done to protect on the work site the smaller work force mr kraft said will allow for increased social distancing the site has banned large group meetings expanded an on site medical clinic and added portable bathrooms and hand washing stations among other changes and testing will continue transcript let us in let us in let us in let us in it doesn t matter what crisis there is you only have the power that you have and you can t take more and if people are going to die i m sorry you only have as much power as you have your liberties that have been trampled upon a day after a boisterous rally that drew hundreds of people some of them armed to michigan s capitol to protest strict statewide stay at home orders gov gretchen whitmer lifted some restrictions in the state agreeing to allow some construction and outdoor work to resume may 7 the construction work includes companies that manufacture partitions and cubicles that eventually will allow for people to safely return to offices and other businesses she said it s going to be one step at a time in increments ms whitmer said of her decisions on reopening parts of the state s economy the governor spoke friday afternoon at a news conference which she opened by thanking janitors who cleaned up after thursday s rally and security officers who kept order during an event she called disturbing the rally included unmasked protesters who did not adhere to social distancing rules and who the governor said were wielding assault rifles confederate flags and swastikas president trump on friday urged ms whitmer to give a little writing that the protesters were very good people but they are angry i know some people are angry and i know many people are feeling restless and are itching to get back to work ms whitmer said there s nothing i want more than to just flip the switch and get back to normal but that s not how it s going to work unfortunately michigan is one of several states with a democratic governor and republican controlled legislature that is mired in partisan bitterness ms whitmer on thursday had signed emergency orders extending some of the most severe stay at home orders in the nation after republican lawmakers had blocked her other attempts to extend stay at home orders asked about mr trump s tweet ms whitmer emphasized that the crisis facing the state was not a political crisis that could be negotiated away but a crisis of public health we have to listen not to pollsters and not just people with political agendas but to epidemiologists she said adding we re making decisions based on science not on a tweet at least 4 193 workers at 115 meatpacking plants in the united states have been infected with the virus according to a report released friday by the centers for disease control and prevention twenty of those workers have died the report said and the data almost certainly understates the scale of the problem because not all states with infections at meat plants have reported figures to the c d c in total the meat and poultry processing industry employs about half a million people many of whom work in cramped conditions in slaughterhouses where social distancing is practically impossible over the last month dozens of meatpacking plants have been forced to close because of outbreaks straining the country s meat supply this week the president issued an executive order that gave officials at the department of agriculture the authority to take some limited actions to keep plants running even when local authorities call for them to close the c d c report also lays out recommendations for meatpacking plants to keep workers safe like installing barriers between workers and requiring face covering u s stocks fell on friday as investors reacted to signs of growing tensions between china and the united states as well as earnings reports by apple and amazon that showed the depth of the pandemic s impact on big business both the s p 500 and the tech heavy nasdaq composite fell about 3 percent amazon shares dropped by more than 7 percent jeff bezos the company s founder said the expense of protecting workers including providing protective equipment and tests could swing the company to a loss of as much as 1 5 billion in the current quarter apple stock dipped after the company refused on thursday to give any estimates for the current quarter but the tech giant signaled confidence by announcing another big stock buyback and said that its first quarter revenue rose nearly 1 percent to 58 3 billion despite lockdowns in china where it assembles nearly all of its products investors also grew leery of signs of a returning u s china strain as the trump administration moved to take a more aggressive stand against china white house aides prodded president trump this week to issue an order to block a government pension fund from investing in chinese companies officials said a move that could upend capital flows across the pacific and the administration is cutting off grants that would help support virology laboratories in wuhan china the city where the virus outbreak began senior aides have asked intelligence agencies to continue looking for any evidence to support an unsubstantiated theory that the pandemic might be the result of an accidental lab leak even though agency analysts have said they most likely will not find proof the open rivalry between the two nations has taken on a much darker shading since the virus spread china is likely to emerge from the recession caused by the pandemic faster than other nations and america will probably rely on economic activity in asia to help prop up its own economy shaken by economic hardship health fears and uncertainty about when campuses will reopen many high school seniors appear to be putting off a decision about where to go to college in the fall or whether to go at all college admissions officers are reluctant to admit weakness meaning there is little hard data at this point but there are clear signs of concern about plummeting enrollment and lost revenue of some 700 universities with a may 1 acceptance deadline which include many of the country s most competitive about half have already given students an extra month to decide said marie bigham founder of accept a college admissions reform group johnny kennevan a senior at seneca high school in tabernacle n j was recruited to play basketball at york college in pennsylvania but his plans would most likely change if the campus is still closed he said it doesn t make sense to pay 20 grand to sit at my computer at home and take online courses he said you can get the same education from a community college some schools are waiving deposit requirements particularly for international students and experts say that the number of wait listed students who are now getting offers shows that even some of the most selective schools are acting more aggressively to fill freshman classes since colleges abruptly shut down campus operations and moved to online learning they have announced hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and say that a 14 billion federal aid package will not be nearly enough to keep struggling schools afloat executives have taken pay cuts endowments have shrunk hiring has been frozen and construction projects have stopped updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities but experts say that is only the beginning if schools cannot persuade students to return in the fall when many campuses are bracing for the possibility that online learning could continue across the country this week americans whose governors said it was time to return to work wrestled with what felt like an impossible choice if they go back will they get sick and infect their families if they refuse will they lose their jobs what if they work on tips and there are no customers if they are businesses owners will there be enough work to rehire employees when maine announced this week that hair salons could reopen sarah kyllonen a stylist in lewiston stayed up late wondering what to do feeling overwhelmed the virus still scared her it seemed too soon to open up then again her bills had not stopped and her unemployment benefits had not started and she was starting to worry about next month s rent it s an extremely hard decision for all of us she said i want to go back to work i want to have the money i want to see people but it s hard because i m worried about the virus coming back around los angeles has become the largest city in the country to offer free testing to anyone regardless of symptoms a significant ramping up of testing that officials in california have said is required to take even tentative steps to open the economy on thursday the first day of free testing for all in los angeles nearly 10 000 people were tested about three times the previous day mayor eric m garcetti announced that any of los angeles county s 12 million residents could get a free test at any of the city s testing sites though county health officials are still advising testing be limited to those with symptoms and the most vulnerable mr garcetti said the city had hundreds of thousands of test kits on hand and would be buying more you don t have to wonder if that cough is covid he said thursday at a news conference you don t have to wonder if you were exposed to somebody you know had or you think had covid you can go get tested now all 50 states are reopening in some way though some are going further than others the washington d c area remains locked down before the outbreak dr lindy fox a dermatologist in san francisco used to see four or five patients a year with chilblains painful red or purple lesions that typically emerge on fingers or toes in the winter over the past few weeks she has seen dozens all of a sudden we are inundated with toes dr fox said i ve got clinics filled with people coming in with new toe lesions the lesions are emerging as yet another telltale symptom of infection with the virus the most prominent signs are a dry cough and shortness of breath but the virus has been linked to unusual and diverse effects like mental confusion and a diminished sense of smell most cases have been reported in children teens and young adults scientists are just beginning to study the phenomenon but so far chilblain like lesions appear to signal a mild or even asymptomatic infection they may also develop several weeks after the acute phase of an infection is over it is unclear why the new virus might cause chilblain like lesions one hypothesis is that they are caused by inflammation a prominent feature of covid 19 transcript the covid 19 crisis has illustrated that even the most sophisticated health systems have struggled to cope with a pandemic w h o has grave concerns about the potential impact the virus could have as it starts to accelerate in countries with weaker health systems of course the pandemic remains a public health emergency of international concern we will continue working with countries and partners to enable essential travel needed for pandemic response humanitarian relief and cargo operations and for countries to gradually resume normal passenger travel the move amid increasing criticism from the trump administration about its handling of the pandemic comes three months after the organization s original decision to announce a public health emergency of international concern on jan 30 at the time only 98 of the nearly 10 000 cases confirmed had occurred outside china s borders but the pandemic continues to grow more than 3 2 million people around the world have been sickened by the virus and nearly a quarter million have died according to official counts hot spots have moved outside china there is evidence on six continents of sustained transmission all of this led experts in the w h o s emergency committee to reconvene to assess the evolution of the pandemic and to advise on updated recommendations officials said there has been a rapid rise in new cases in africa and south america where many countries have weak health care systems that could easily be overwhelmed the acceleration is concerning because the growth rate of the virus has appeared to slow in many other countries in asia and europe although people are slowly starting to return to work in china after weeks of lockdowns nonessential stores are still shuttered in most parts of the world and the virus has badly damaged the economy the trump administration has cut off funding for the organization claiming without evidence that w h o officials colluded with china to obscure the extent of the epidemic in its early days political strategists have advised republicans that blaming china and by extension the w h o is an effective deflection from criticism of the administration s own handling of the epidemic in the united states treasury secretary steven mnuchin wants private schools with large endowments to return federal stimulus loans they received from a program intended for small businesses hit hard by the pandemic in a tweet mr mnuchin said friday it has come to our attention that some private schools with significant endowments have taken the loans they should return them he said many prominent prep schools have applied for the loans which are being issued by the small business administration to help businesses meet their payroll needs the new york times reported this week some decided not to take the loans because of their other resources but others said they needed the money the recipients include sidwell friends in washington d c the alma mater of president obama s and president clinton s children and st andrew s episcopal school in potomac md which counts the president s youngest son as a student the los angeles times reported on thursday that a private school in los angeles attended by at least two of mr mnuchin s children had also accepted a loan and that a spokeswoman for mr mnuchin had described the arrangement as inappropriate in his tweet on friday mr mnuchin did not specify what qualified as a significant endowment sidwell friends has an endowment of roughly 50 million while st andrews indicated in a 2017 tax filing that its endowment was about 9 million run by the s b a the 660 billion aid program formally known as the paycheck protection program has been criticized for providing funds to large public companies ahead of main street small businesses like restaurants and shops the money comes in the form of loans backed by the s b a that can be forgiven if recipients put most of it toward payroll needs transcript i will echo the president s displeasure with china it s no secret that china mishandled this situation just a few examples for you they did not share the genetic sequence until a professor in shanghai did so on his own the very next day the decisions of china that i referenced slow walking some of that information put american lives at risk and rest assured this president has one priority and that is the safety and the well being of american lives i will never lie to you you have my word on that as to the timing of the briefings we do plan to do them i will announce timing of that forthcoming but we do plan to continue these the press secretary kayleigh mcenany began the briefing on friday by announcing that the trump administration plans to distribute 12 billion to 395 hospitals across the country ms mcenany who started last month said new york new jersey and illinois received the most funding by state the white house hadn t held a briefing since march 11 2019 when sarah huckabee sanders took the lectern for the last time her successor in the job stephanie grisham completed her short tenure in the position without ever holding a news conference ms mcenany is expected to hold semiregular news briefings but white house officials said it would not be a daily briefing but rather a supplement to mr trump s own sessions with reporters ms mcenany vowed that as she continued holding briefings i will never lie to you you have my word on that but the fact that ms mcenany will choose which days she will hold briefings some critics argued makes them less of an exercise in transparency and more another part of the white house reality show style programming at friday s briefing ms mcenany repeated a number of false or misleading statements that the trump administration has repeatedly made about china and the world health organization ms mcenany ended her first session with a plug for fox news encouraging americans to tune in to a town hall the network where she formerly served as a contributor is hosting with mr trump on sunday she called it can t miss television and plugged the high ratings mr trump s own virus news briefings have earned with more than 18 000 announced fatalities and a total death toll that is almost certainly higher the crisis is the worst mass casualty event to hit new york since the spanish flu pandemic a century ago at the height of the outbreak in april a new yorker was dying almost every two minutes more than 800 per day or four times the city s normal death rate and though the daily toll has recently slowed hundreds of bodies are still emerging each day from private homes and hospitals while hospitals bore the initial brunt of the crisis as sick people flooded emergency rooms the sheer volume of human remains has pushed the system for caring for the dead to its limits too hospital morgues funeral homes cemeteries and crematories are all overflowing and backed up the death rate is just so high one funeral director said there s no way we can bury or cremate them fast enough with a flood of unemployment claims continuing to overwhelm many state agencies economists say the job losses may be much deeper than government tallies indicate the labor department said on thursday that 3 8 million workers filed for unemployment benefits last week bringing the six week total to 30 million but researchers say that as the economy staggers under the weight of the pandemic millions of others have lost jobs but have yet to appear in the figures a study by the economic policy institute found that roughly 50 percent more people than counted as filing claims in a recent four week period may have qualified for benefits with the difference representing those who were stymied in applying or who did not even try because the process was too formidable the problem is even bigger than the data suggest said elise gould a senior economist with the institute a left leaning research group we re undercounting the economic pain as unemployment soars nationwide tenants rights groups and community nonprofits have rallied around an audacious goal to persuade the government to halt rent and mortgage payments without back payments accruing for as long as the economy is battered by the virus the effort has been brewing on social media with the hashtag cancelrent and online video rallies as well as a smattering of in person protests frequently held in cars to maintain social distancing but landlords say they are also struggling to pay their bills since many tenants have already been unable to pay rent they call the advocates efforts reckless and say that withholding rent would create cascading consequences including leaving property owners without the means to pay mortgages and property taxes or to maintain buildings still from new york to kansas city to los angeles groups have encouraged tenants to withhold payments on friday the due date for may rent aiming to create pressure for an expansion of affordable housing and tenant friendly legislation to cancel rent and mortgage payments the federal government would have to take sweeping and possibly unconstitutional intervention in the housing and financial markets interceding in private contracts and ordering banks and landlords not to collect money while the prospect of this happening is low the campaigns are less about pushing a particular piece of legislation and more about kindling a mass movement akin to the occupy wall street protests that followed the 2008 financial crisis the new saturday night with billions of people staying home the world is reinventing the weekend maybe you started this lockdown
