advertisement supported by by alexander burns and jonathan martin alarmed by the tight race for a congressional seat in ohio republicans are steeling for a 90 day campaign of trench warfare as they fight to keep control of the house pinning their hopes on well funded outside groups and a slashing negative message about democrats voting across the midwest and west laid bare the party s precarious situation on wednesday ohio s special election exposed deep vulnerabilities in the historically conservative suburbs of columbus and the republican candidate there held a slim lead over his democratic challenger in kansas a nomination fight for governor also remained too close to call the day after the primary with a hard right candidate threatening to topple the state s republican incumbent and splinter the party down ballot and in primaries from suburban detroit to seattle democrats selected hard charging candidates in districts long held by the republican party republicans say they can keep a thin grip on the house by propping up incumbent lawmakers in red tinged districts and branding the democrats as wildly left wing but senior party strategists have concluded that over a dozen districts held by republicans may already be unwinnable most in metropolitan areas where president trump has alienated moderates and stirred volcanic resistance on the left every white suburban district in the country will be a swing district in november that s the takeaway from the ohio election said representative carlos curbelo a florida republican who is being targeted by democrats the republicans can afford to lose only 22 seats over all to maintain even a one seat majority that leaves them with little room for error over the remaining three months of the campaign veteran party lawmakers have an increasingly bleak view of their prospects in the house and some fear that democrats could seize the chamber by a solid margin there s a real likelihood that they not only win the house but they win it by 10 or 12 more seats than they need said senator lindsey graham of south carolina voicing publicly what many republican officials have begun to acknowledge privately this summer mr graham said a democratic takeover was no sure thing noting that in the era of trump things can change in 24 hours for good or bad but he said any republican in a remotely competitive district could face a difficult general election we re bleeding among women and the enthusiasm factor for democrats is worth 7 or 8 points and sometimes more he said using political jargon to describe just how deep into republican territory the battlefield might stretch if i was a house guy in an r 10 or less seat i d be getting on the phone and raising money and putting a sign on my dog here are key takeaways from tuesday s voting in kansas republicans faced uncertainty wednesday not only about their candidate for governor this fall but also whether they were creating a political opportunity for democrats to win the office in november should the party ultimately nominate kris w kobach its hard right candidate for governor it could also undermine republicans in congressional races down ballot with all kansas precincts reporting wednesday morning mr kobach the secretary of state was ahead of gov jeff colyer by just 191 votes out of more than 311 000 republican ballots cast the results were likely to remain in flux for at least several days and in another race where republicans could be vulnerable in november sharice davids a lawyer who is native american won the democratic congressional primary on wednesday in a swing district that surrounds kansas city she will face representative kevin yoder in november it is one of two republican held districts in the state along with a more rural open seat next door where democrats are threatening to shave down the house majority in ohio the republican candidate for congress troy balderson was ahead by 1 754 votes out of more than 202 000 ballots cast a lead of nearly 1 percentage point but 3 435 provisional ballots have yet to be counted ohio law provides for an automatic recount if the two candidates are ultimately separated by less than half a percentage point the democratic candidate in ohio danny o connor has not conceded the race he called it a tied ballgame on tuesday night and is set to face mr balderson again in the november general election illustrating the aggressive approach the republican party is taking to reinforcing its candidates in conservative leaning districts the congressional leadership fund the principal super pac dedicated to house republicans has already begun airing attack ads against democratic challengers in three traditionally red seats in kansas kentucky and upstate new york mr trump carried all three districts in 2016 but democrats are pursuing all of them ferociously transcript america is on the right path the result of the highly watched special election in ohio s 12th congressional district is still too close to call while republican troy balderson holds a slim lead over democrat danny o connor thousands of provisional ballots are still left to be counted we went door to door we went house to house we made our case for change but why did the republican party have to fight so hard to defend its 38 year hold on this house seat first let s look at the trump effect the 12th district has traditionally been represented by by moderate business minded republicans like pat tiberi burdensome regulations and a broken tax code keep american businesses from hiring but it doesn t have to be that way but balderson embraced the populist tone of trump a highly nontraditional republican i ll end sanctuary cities to stop illegals from taking our jobs fight alongside trump to implement his agenda and use conservative grit to build the darn wall this was also a year when republicans fought complacency to try and motivate voters outside republican groups opted for polarizing messaging the liberal resistance is demanding open borders opening america s doors to more crime and drugs danny o connor would join the resistance republican groups poured more than 3 7 million into the race spending five times as much as the democrats dishonest danny would vote with pelosi to raise our taxes republicans even pried a late endorsement from gov john kasich a trump critic troy shares our common sense values on the important issues that face us today now let s look at the democrats danny o connor positioned himself as part of the blue wave we need new leadership in both parties and instead of corporate giveaways that pile up debt let s cut taxes for working people o connor also got an unanticipated boost when the traditionally conservative editorial page of the columbus dispatch endorsed him so even though balderson may win this special election he ll have to once again face off against o connor in november corry bliss the group s chief strategist said republicans needed to wage a national campaign to disqualify democrats as a political alternative in the eyes of voters this is a tough environment and we have to give voters a choice in november mr bliss said one party has cut your taxes and helped create the best economy in decades the other party says we will raise taxes we will abolish ice and we will put nancy pelosi in charge of it all but mr bliss also sent a stern message to lawmakers in his own party who may not be bracing adequately for a fall onslaught by democrats the congressional leadership fund spent millions of dollars in ohio to salvage the campaign of mr balderson while republicans are expected to hold a financial advantage in the fall campaign over all the party is unlikely to be able to fund similarly expensive rescue missions in dozens of vulnerable districts many of which have more forbidding demographics than the ohio seat we have to have members who raise money run good campaigns and provide a good contrast for november mr bliss warned what alarms congressional republicans though is what is out of their hands not just mr trump s conduct but also some of the controversial candidates leading their tickets in addition to kansas should mr kobach prevail house republicans are burdened with unpopular standard bearers in illinois gov bruce rauner and virginia a senate candidate corey stewart who together could drag down at least a half dozen lawmakers in the ohio race some former republican loyalists defected to mr o connor while other right of center voters may simply have stayed home producing a close outcome in a lopsidedly republican area mr balderson may have prevailed because just enough conservative voters remain satisfied enough with mr trump i wish he would quit tweeting at night but i think he has made a lot of changes that people voted for him to do said david haid 70 who operates oil and gas wells in ohio but voters like mr haid are less plentiful in many other suburban districts and in ohio jennifer kramer a small business owner gave voice to the unease of women in these areas who have recoiled most sharply from the president i don t feel things are better now because of the divisiveness said ms kramer 42 blaming mr trump for sowing discord you have people who feel they can be more vocal about their hatred trump is not the type of leader i respect the ohio results were not the only ominous signal for republicans on tuesday night the party s suburban slump showed up in districts far beyond ohio in washington state where candidates from all parties compete in nonpartisan open primary elections republican candidates posted limp results in three congressional districts including an open seat in the seattle suburbs and the seat in eastern washington held by representative cathy mcmorris rodgers a member of the republicans leadership team in the house and in a sign that they are already preparing for substantial losses republican officials are contemplating political triage weighing which districts may be beyond hope and determining where money can be saved among the seats that republicans see slipping out of reach are those held by representatives rod blum of iowa and jason lewis of minnesota along with more than half a dozen open seats currently held by republicans in new jersey florida pennsylvania and arizona and after tracking the ohio election late into the night bleary eyed republicans awoke on wednesday to the news that representative chris collins of new york who holds a solid red district near buffalo was facing criminal charges related to financial dealings the news may imperil mr collins s seat in a development the party can ill afford more broadly the specter of one of mr trump s earliest and most vocal supporters being arrested on insider trading charges may hand democrats an opportunity to tar the republican majority as corrupt democrats for their part appear increasingly emboldened even in districts tilting well to the right of center in ohio alone three or four other republican held seats could be up for grabs in november if the political dynamics of the moment hold for the next few months and democrats see the same political sluggishness on the part of a number of republican incumbents that has g o p strategists so anxious about the general election ken harbaugh a democrat and former navy pilot seeking a solidly republican seat in northeast ohio said voters in his area sensed the disengagement of the sitting lawmaker there bob gibbs a republican in his fourth term mr harbaugh is running on some of the same themes championing affordable health care and attacking entrenched politicians in washington that mr o connor put at the center of his campaign the story writes itself when you ve got an incumbent who s never gotten a bill passed into law who hasn t looked his constituents in the eye in years hasn t done a real town hall in years mr harbaugh said wednesday morning and people are sick and tired of paying someone to do nothing mr harbaugh pointed to the special election as a sign that voters in ohio are hungry for change and focused on health care most of all they are just sick and tired of a political class that isn t working for them he said advertisement
