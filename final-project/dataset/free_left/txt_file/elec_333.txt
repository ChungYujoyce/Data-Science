advertisement supported by political memo by jonathan martin washington when president obama addressed members of the democratic national committee here over the weekend he offered a glowing account of the economic recovery under his administration america is coming back he said after rattling off an array of upbeat economic indicators we ve risen from recession but as both parties begin positioning themselves for the election to succeed mr obama the politics of the economy are far more complicated than the president would have them among democrats there are divisions over the degree to which hillary rodham clinton considered their leading contender should praise the recovery and run on mr obama s stewardship of the economy and republicans assessing falling unemployment and soaring job creation under a president with still mediocre approval ratings are grasping for the right way to frame their 2016 campaign message the coming debate over the economy and by extension mr obama s legacy is a particularly acute topic for governors who are often judged by voters on their states economic performance and who spend much of their time on job creation as the governors gathered here for their annual winter meeting there was bipartisan optimism about the economy but it was guarded in many parts of the country we are seeing increasing momentum in terms of recovery but in almost every state and certainly in parts of colorado we are still struggling to get the unemployment down gov john w hickenlooper of colorado said and most importantly the wages still haven t started rising colorado s unemployment rate was down to 4 percent in december below the national average which was 5 7 percent in january according to the bureau of labor statistics but mr hickenlooper s sober analysis suggests an awareness that voters are not yet enjoying a boon and certainly are not yet fully crediting mr obama for the recovery indeed a quinnipiac university poll in colorado a crucial swing state released last week indicated that 58 percent of voters said they wanted the next president to change direction from barack obama s policies and the president s job approval rating was only 43 percent perhaps mindful of such data mr hickenlooper a democrat indicated that mrs clinton could not run simply on the recent good economic news i am not saying who the candidate is going to be but i don t think she will come with everything is fine everything is going well he said i suspect that she will come forward with some new ideas and some innovative ideas on how we can begin to move wages up and how we can help businesses expand more rapidly and create more jobs yet in another important state on the presidential map the democratic governor said mrs clinton should not be shy about linking herself to mr obama s record she should embrace the obama economic policies that have moved the country forward absolutely said the governor terry mcauliffe of virginia a close friend of both mrs clinton s and former president bill clinton s go through the numbers look where we are today things are booming but mr mcauliffe was quick to add that mr obama could make it easier for mrs clinton to offer that embrace if his administration was more effective in trumpeting the recovery i think they need to do a much better job of explaining their successes said mr mcauliffe who was the chairman of mrs clinton s 2008 presidential campaign i don t get it what most of the governors in both parties agreed on was that longstanding wage stagnation was diminishing the political impact of the recovery we still have a wage problem we are still creating too many low wage not family supporting jobs said gov gina raimondo of rhode island a democrat who was elected last year in a state that was among the hardest hit by the recession ms raimondo whose state has a 6 8 percent unemployment rate added so there is a lot of work to do she has a wage problem that she has to fix the country s structural economic challenges whether wages diminished manufacturing or other challenges associated with globalization are such that mrs clinton must come up with her own agenda gov jack markell of delaware another democrat said i think it would be a mistake for somebody to be running on it s great guns we just have to keep doing what we re doing mr markell said it ought to be in a changing world here are the things we need to do differently early signs suggest that mrs clinton intends to offer proposals that would move beyond mr obama s ideas notably a plan to offer incentives to corporations that increase profit sharing with employees if democrats are grappling with how best to hail the resurgent economy while acknowledging its underlying difficulties republicans are engaged in a conversation over whether they should remain critical of the recovery claim a share of credit for it or move on to different issues many of the republican governors from states where economic improvement has been significant on their watch are uneasy about their nominee s continuing to bad mouth the economy gov terry e branstad of iowa where unemployment is down to 4 1 percent said republican presidential candidates should point to job growth in republican led states take some credit for what republican governors have done because the recipe to revitalize the national economy is to do the same thing mr branstad said he also suggested that republicans ought to focus on national security an issue on which mr obama may prove to be more vulnerable than the economy advertisement
