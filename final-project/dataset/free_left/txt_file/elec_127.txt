advertisement supported by transcript these are not memories that you want to go over it s been somewhat unnerving since friday to be rehashing it so many times you suppress it it s not part of your active thinking every day but you don t forget i m jessica leeds i m 74 years old i ve had the privilege of living in new york city since 1981 it was over 35 years ago i was hired by a newsprint company i was a sales rep i was traveling in the middle west i was coming back into new york city and it was on that flight that the stewardess asked me to would i like to move up to first class i didn t need to be asked twice and i sat down next to a young man blond tall and he introduced himself as donald trump i was not really aware of the real estate world of trump we just chatted back and forth nothing particular it wasn t until they cleared the meal that somehow or another the armrest in the seat disappeared and it was a real shock when all of a sudden his hands were all over me he started encroaching on my space and i hesitate to use this expression but i m going to and that is he was like an octopus it was like he had six arms he was all over the place if he had stuck with the upper part of the body i might not have gotten i might not have gotten that upset but it s when he started putting his hand up my skirt and that was it that was it i i was out of there and i don t think i said a word during the late 60s 70s and into the 80s the culture had instilled in us that somehow it was our fault the attention that we received from men that we were responsible for their behavior you didn t complain to the authorities you didn t complain to your boss if something happened to you you just bucked up and you went on i thought to myself gee i wish the stewardess would come and rescue me and then i decided i got up i got my purse and i said i m going back to my seat in coach i was so glad to get back to that seat i started telling my story about a year and a half ago when it became apparent that trump was actually running for president and i started telling my friends let me tell you what this guy s all about i would like to think that sharing this story would make a difference both in the election and in society s view of women to change some of the behavior the sexual behavior between men and women in both directions and i i would like very much to feel like i ve been a part of that i feel it s a control issue that if men could get past trying to control women whatever we can do to get through to people that this is not the way it should be it would be very important by megan twohey and michael barbaro donald j trump was emphatic in the second presidential debate yes he had boasted about kissing women without permission and grabbing their genitals but he had never actually done those things he said no he declared under questioning on sunday evening i have not at that moment sitting at home in manhattan jessica leeds 74 felt he was lying to her face i wanted to punch the screen she said in an interview in her apartment more than three decades ago when she was a traveling businesswoman at a paper company ms leeds said she sat beside mr trump in the first class cabin of a flight to new york they had never met before about 45 minutes after takeoff she recalled mr trump lifted the armrest and began to touch her according to ms leeds mr trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt he was like an octopus she said his hands were everywhere she fled to the back of the plane it was an assault she said ms leeds has told the story to at least four people close to her who also spoke with the new york times mr trump s claim that his crude words had never turned into actions was similarly infuriating to a woman watching on sunday night in ohio rachel crooks ms crooks was a 22 year old receptionist at bayrock group a real estate investment and development company in trump tower in manhattan when she encountered mr trump outside an elevator in the building one morning in 2005 aware that her company did business with mr trump she turned and introduced herself they shook hands but mr trump would not let go she said instead he began kissing her cheeks then she said he kissed me directly on the mouth it didn t feel like an accident she said it felt like a violation it was so inappropriate ms crooks recalled in an interview i was so upset that he thought i was so insignificant that he could do that shaken ms crooks returned to her desk and immediately called her sister brianne webb in the small town in ohio where they grew up and told her what had happened she was very worked up about it said ms webb who recalled pressing her sister for details being from a town of 1 600 people being na ve i was like are you sure he didn t just miss trying to kiss you on the cheek she said no he kissed me on the mouth i was like that is not normal in the days since mr trump s campaign was jolted by a 2005 recording that caught him bragging about pushing himself on women he has insisted as have his aides that it was simply macho bluster it s just words he has said repeatedly and his hope for salvaging his candidacy rests heavily on whether voters believe that claim they should not say ms leeds and ms crooks whose stories have never been made public before and their accounts echo those of other women who have previously come forward like temple taggart a former miss utah who said that mr trump kissed her on the mouth more than once when she was a 21 year old pageant contestant in a phone interview on tuesday night a highly agitated mr trump denied every one of the women s claims none of this ever took place said mr trump who began shouting at the times reporter who was questioning him he said that the times was making up the allegations to hurt him and that he would sue the news organization if it reported them you are a disgusting human being he told the reporter as she questioned him about the women s claims asked whether he had ever done any of the kissing or groping that he had described on the recording mr trump was once again insistent i don t do it i don t do it it was locker room talk but for the women who shared their stories with the times the recording was more than that as upsetting as it was it offered them a kind of affirmation they said that was the case for ms taggart mr trump s description of how he kisses beautiful women without invitation described precisely what he did to her she said i just start kissing them mr trump said on the tape it s like a magnet just kiss i don t even wait ms crooks and ms leeds never reported their accounts to the authorities but they both shared what happened to them with friends and family ms crooks did so immediately afterward ms leeds described the events to those close to her more recently as mr trump became more visible politically and ran for president ms leeds was 38 at the time and living in connecticut she had been seated in coach but a flight attendant invited her to take an empty seat in first class she said that seat was beside mr trump who did not yet own a fleet of private aircraft records show he introduced himself and shook her hand they exchanged pleasantries and mr trump asked her if she was married she was divorced and told him so later after their dinner trays were cleared she said mr trump raised the armrest moved toward her and began to grope her ms leeds said she recoiled she quickly left the first class cabin and returned to coach she said i was angry and shook up she recalled as she sat on a couch in her new york city apartment on tuesday she did not complain to the airline staff at the time ms leeds said because such unwanted advances from men occurred throughout her time in business in the 1970s and early 1980s we accepted it for years she said of the conduct we were taught it was our fault she recalled bumping into mr trump at a charity event in new york about two years later and said he seemed to recall her insulting her with a crude remark she had largely put the encounter on the plane out of her mind until last year when mr trump s presidential campaign became more serious since then she has told a widening circle of people including her son a nephew and two friends all of whom were contacted by the times they said they were sickened by what they heard it made me shake said linda ross a neighbor and friend who spoke with ms leeds about the interaction about six months ago like several of ms leeds s friends ms ross encouraged her to tell her story to the news media ms leeds had resisted until sunday s debate which she watched with ms ross when mr trump denied having ever sexually assaulted women in response to a question from anderson cooper of cnn ms ross said she immediately looked at ms leeds in disbelief now we know he lied straight up ms ross recalled saying in the days after the debate ms leeds recounted her experience in an email to the times and a series of interviews his behavior is deep seated in his character ms leeds wrote in the message to those who would vote for him she added i would wish for them to reflect on this for ms crooks the encounter with mr trump was further complicated by the fact that she worked in his building and risked running into him again a few hours after mr trump kissed her ms crooks returned to her apartment in the bay ridge section of brooklyn and broke down to her boyfriend at the time clint hackenburg i asked how was your day mr hackenburg recalled she paused for a second and then started hysterically crying after ms crooks described her experience with mr trump she and mr hackenburg discussed what to do i think that what was more upsetting than him kissing her was that she felt like she couldn t do anything to him because of his position he said she was 22 she was a secretary it was her first job out of college i remember her saying i can t do anything to this guy because he s donald trump days later ms crooks said mr trump who had recently married melania came into the bayrock office and requested her phone number when she asked why he needed it mr trump told her he intended to pass it along to his modeling agency ms crooks was skeptical but relented because of mr trump s influence over her company she never heard from the modeling agency during the rest of her year working at bayrock she made a point of ducking out of sight every time mr trump came into view when bayrock employees were invited to the trump organization christmas party she declined wanting to avoid any other encounters with him but the episode stuck with her even after she returned to ohio where she now works for a university when she read a times article in may about the republican nominee s treatment of women she was struck by ms taggart s recollection of being kissed on the mouth by mr trump i was upset that it had happened to other people but also took some comfort in knowing i wasn t the only one he had done it to said ms crooks who reached out to the times to share her story both ms leeds and ms crooks say they support hillary clinton s campaign for president and ms crooks has made contributions of less than 200 to president obama and mrs clinton ms crooks was initially reluctant to go public with her story but felt compelled to talk about her experience people should know she said of mr trump this behavior is pervasive and it is real advertisement
