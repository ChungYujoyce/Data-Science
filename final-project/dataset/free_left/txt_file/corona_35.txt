advertisement supported by defiance of public health directives has become a mark of right wing identity by michelle goldberg opinion columnist a washington post article on sunday described people in a posh suburb of atlanta celebrating liberation from coronavirus lockdown i went to the antique mall yesterday on highway 9 and it was just like it was like freedom said a woman getting a pedicure yeah i m going to do the laser and the filler said a woman at a wine bar looking forward to cosmetic dermatology when you start seeing where the cases are coming from and the demographics i m not worried said a man lounging in a plaza only one person was quoted expressing trepidation a masked clerk in a shoe store i live an hour away and was driving in this morning only me on the road and i was thinking am i doing the right thing she said lately some commentators have suggested that the coronavirus lockdowns pit an affluent professional class comfortable staying home indefinitely against a working class more willing to take risks to do their jobs writing in the post fareed zakaria tried to make sense of the partisan split over coronavirus restrictions describing a class divide with pro lockdown experts on one side and those who work with their hands on the other on fox news steve hilton decried a 37 percent work from home elite punishing real people trying to earn a living in a column titled scenes from the class struggle in lockdown the wall street journal s peggy noonan wrote here s a generalization based on a lifetime of experience and observation the working class people who are pushing back have had harder lives than those now determining their fate the assumptions underlying this generalization however are not based on even a cursory look at actual data in a recent washington post ipsos survey 74 percent of respondents agreed that the u s should keep trying to slow the spread of the coronavirus even if that means keeping many businesses closed agreement was slightly higher 79 percent among respondents who d been laid off or furloughed researchers at the university of chicago have been tracking the impact of coronavirus on a representative sample of american households they ve found that when it comes to judging policies on the coronavirus politics is the overwhelming force dividing americans and that how households have been economically impacted by the covid crisis so far plays only a minimal role donald trump and his allies have polarized the response to the coronavirus turning defiance of public health directives into a mark of right wing identity because a significant chunk of trump s base is made up of whites without a college degree there are naturally many such people among the lockdown protesters but it s a mistake to treat the growing ideological divide over when and how to reopen the country as a matter of class rather than partisanship the push for a faster reopening even in places where coronavirus cases are growing has significant elite support and many of those who face exposure as they re ordered back to work are rightly angry and terrified because here s the thing about reopening it s liberation to some but compulsion to others if your employer reopens but you don t feel safe going to work you can t continue to collect unemployment benefits in the texas tribune a waitress in odessa spoke of her fear when she was called back to work at a restaurant that hadn t put adequate social distancing measures in place it scared me so i left she said then i had to remember that if i do quit i would have to lose my unemployment meatpacking workers have been sickened with coronavirus at wildly disproportionate rates and all over the country there have been protests outside of meatpacking plants demanding that they be temporarily closed sometimes by the workers own children perhaps because those demonstrators have been unarmed they ve received far less coverage than those opposed to lockdown orders indeed across america there s been a surge in labor activism as people made to work in unsafe conditions stage strikes walkouts and sickouts it sounds corny but we re moving towards a worker rebellion ron herrera president of the los angeles county federation of labor told the los angeles times meanwhile financial elites are eager for everyone else to resume powering the economy people will die people do die wall street has had enough of the lockdown was the headline on a recent vanity fair article it cited a banker calling for broad legal indemnification for employers against claims related to the virus so that employees can t sue if their workplace exposes them to illness here we see the real coronavirus class divide in some ways i can relate to the exultant georgians who ve decided to deny the danger of coronavirus i too hate life under lockdown and i yearn for some social distance from my children every day i scan the news for information about whether schools will reopen in the fall i d love a pedicure or a drink with a friend and i know that plenty of people desperate to escape these grim new limits on our lives have far more urgent needs to save a business or support their families but when it comes to the coronavirus willingness to ignore public health authorities isn t a sign of flinty working class realism often it s the ultimate mark of privilege the
