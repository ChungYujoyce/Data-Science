advertisement supported by by matt flegenheimer and maggie haberman donald j trump pledged to bomb the uh stuffing out of the islamic state senator rand paul called any proposed trade off between safety and liberty nothing but bull before adding a syllable even jeb bush the stern patrician of the republican race has shown a growing fondness for some gentler four letter words at times adding them to prepared remarks that had called for something meeker we re americans damn it he shouted recently at a new hampshire barbecue though no one had suggested otherwise a little more than two months before the voting begins the candidates have charged into what appears to be the inaugural profanity primary wrought by an overstuffed field of competitors vying for attention and the specter of a foul mouthed manhattanite perched atop the polls the reasons for saltiness seem varied a play for machismo perhaps particularly as national security becomes a chief focus or a signal of vitality rawness a willingness to break through the din across both parties female candidates in the race carly fiorina and hillary rodham clinton have little reputation for using such language are you allowed to use profanity mr paul asked after doing so on nov 19 to raucous cheers during remarks at george washington university it would appear so yet the outbursts make clear the extent to which mr trump the election s clear pacesetter in vulgarity continues to dictate the tenor of the race though in recent days his most provocative remarks by most accounts have been perfectly printable like claiming against all evidence that he saw thousands of muslims in new jersey celebrating the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york candidates hoping to outswear mr trump are almost certainly overmatched he has appraised the friendship between mr bush and senator marco rubio as political bs without abbreviating and twice told an ohio crowd you bet your ass he would revive the interrogation technique known as waterboarding a recent interview about mr trump s twitter habits ended with this warning treat us fairly he said otherwise i ll tweet the er daylights outta you mr trump s advisers see his influence in his rivals choice of words noting mr paul s expletive this month and an email to supporters using that word rand totally admires and worships mr trump and copies anything he says said corey lewandowski the trump campaign manager in an email claiming rand is imitating trump now that s really ahem a farce retorted doug stafford mr paul s main adviser who in fact repeated the out of bounds noun his boss had used at g w u there have of course been indecorous moments in presidential politics before george w bush on the trail in 2000 was caught swearing into a live microphone while assessing a reporter from the new york times senator john mccain the 2008 republican presidential nominee and a navy veteran could be quite coarse and this election season was robbed of perhaps its most colorful imprecatory prospect when vice president joseph r biden jr decided against a run his masterpiece calling the president s health care law a big deal with a two syllable modifier in between during what he thought was a private aside but those moments became public by accident such frequent deliberate cursing by presidential candidates addressing campaign audiences in this election cycle seems to be without modern precedent it is a striking departure for a party whose 2012 nominee mitt romney let fly expressions like h e double hockey sticks when he wanted to be puckish republican officials have strained to adjust questioning whether the moment will last he does it because he needs attention and can t control himself stuart stevens who was mr romney s chief strategist said of mr trump both are not qualities in demand in a president henry barbour a republican national committee member said it was all just part of this strange reality tv era we are suffering through some milder adjectives appear to be bipartisan in the first democratic debate senator bernie sanders of vermont memorably declared that america was tired of hearing about hillary rodham clinton s damn emails lower polling candidates in the republican field have gravitated instead toward a trump like tactic insult rivals add a dash of profanity end with a rhetorical question you ve got the no 2 guy tried to kill somebody at 14 and the no 1 guy is high energy and crazy as hell senator lindsey graham said on msnbc last month referring to ben carson who has said he tried to stab a friend as a teenager and mr trump how am i losing to these people even the mellow mr carson has participated gingerly this is a bunch of crap he said at the debate in boulder colo last month discussing government regulations some candidates seem to relish the shift in decorum when mr trump offered his colorful assessment of the bush rubio relationship in september mr bush was asked to respond generally to the slight i will not answer that question until i hear exactly what he said and the terminology he used he said feigning a dodge until the reporter dana bash of cnn obliged i just wanted to hear it he said with a smirk for news organizations style guidelines generally dictate that obscenities should not be printed unless they are newsworthy a bleepworthy mr bush for instance would not be afforded a literal rendering but a president bush hot damn advertisement
