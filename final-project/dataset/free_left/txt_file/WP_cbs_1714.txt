news of the week coming up on face the nation welcome to face the nation margaret is off today it is a grim sunday morning as we woke up to the news of yet another mass shooting in this country this one in dayton ohio dean reynolds will join us in a moment for more on that but we begin in el paso with cbs news correspondent janet shamlian janet shamlian cbs news correspondent good morning major it s an active crime scene at this walmart today which has become the deadliest mass shooting in america since the massacre at a texas church in 2017 investigators are now looking at motive and whether this was a hate crime begin vt janet shamlian a chilling image that police say is the gunman on surveillance camera walking into a walmart carrying an ak 47 style assault rifle and wearing noise muffling headphones and then this cell phone video captured the rapid fire shots as a man hides under a table others record the heart stopping chaos man 1 ak somebody has got you janet shamlian police say the walmart was at capacity packed with families shopping for back to school greg allen everyone that carries a badge in this town pretty much showed up to that particular scene janet shamlian police say the gunman surrendered to police twenty one year old patrick crusius is from the dallas area a nine hour drive away the store is just miles from the border and attracts shoppers from mexico detectives have found what s been described as an anti immigrant manifesto posted online but have not confirmed it was authored by the gunman governor greg abbott governor of texas this is dis disgusting intolerable it s not texan and we are going to aggressively prosecute it both as capital murder but also as a hate crime which is exactly what it appears to be without having seen all the evidence yet janet shamlian more than two dozen hurt many of them in critical condition man 2 i ve been here twenty two years this is by far the biggest shooting event that i have been involved in janet shamlian and urgent plea for blood donations delivered thousands of volunteers waiting in long lines in triple digit heat a heartbroken community desperate to help end vt janet shamlian the injured are at several el paso hospitals today we are told that a number of them are in critical condition and children are among those badly injured major major garrett janet shamlian thank you we go now to dean reynolds who is at the cincinnati airport on the way to dayton ohio dean what can you tell us dean reynolds cbs news correspondent well major this all began about one o clock this morning in what s called the oregon district of dayton it s sort of a trendy nightlife area popular with young people and it was full of young people and tourists and so forth at that time when a gunman a lone gun we are told approached carrying a big weapon and multiple high capacity magazines he opened fire killing nine people before the police could subdue him and kill him at least twenty six people have been wounded in the attack we are told and the mayor nan whaley of dayton said the situation could have been much worse let s listen so what she said nan whaley in less than one minute in less than one minute dayton fire first responders neutralized the shooter while this is a terribly sad day for our city i am amazed by the quick response of dayton police that saved literally hundreds of lives dean reynolds now it s important to remember that dayton the city is recovering from a series of tornadoes that struck here in memorial day over the memorial day weekend and destroyed hundreds of properties so this has been a very very trying time for the city of dayton and this just makes matters even worse major major garrett dean reynolds thank you we turn now to ohio democratic senator sherrod brown he is in cleveland but will soon be making his way to dayton senator brown good morning i want to ask you senator sherrod brown d ohio sensherrodbrown thank you major garrett the authorities will tell us more about what happened overnight in dayton but i want to ask you do you believe this is a moment in american history that we are at or should be at a turning point on this question of mass shootings and what to do about them senator sherrod brown of course it is i i spoke to the mayor to mayor whaley the mayor of this great ohio city of dayton earlier this morning and she said she had gotten text messages and e mails and calls from she said dozens and dozens of fellow mayors around the country all of whom have gone through this and you know we wake up to to grief and and sadness about these these these victims and these families but it pretty quickly turns to anger that our that our government hasn t done anything and i mitch mcconnell should bring us back into session on monday the house of representatives has passed a background check we can fly back into washington on monday morning we could pass the background check bill and people could fly back and be home for dinner and the president needs to sign this bill we know what to do we know that background checks worked we know that that a ban on assault weapons worked it was bipartisan and it expired and we haven t renewed it those are the first two things we should do and in that sense it it could finally put the country on the right path on gun violence major garrett some of your republican colleagues this morning lindsey graham in the senate from south carolina fred upton republican from michigan in the house have said that they now are in favor of so called red flag laws that states use to briefly detain someone who they believe or reasonably believe that the due process applied present a threat to the community for mental health issues are red flag laws in your opinion also part of this equation senator sherrod brown well i i i wouldn t start with that i mean of course of course people who have stood with the nra in their careers will start though deflect into something else but we know that background checks work we know that the ban on assault weapon work weapons worked yet we saw president bush support the background think think about this i mean we ve had look at look at president obama s response to sandy hook in charleston look at president bush s response after 9 11 where he went to a mosque and he said muslims didn t attack the united states terrorists attacked the united states and and members of congress need to go back to works in the senate go back to work tomorrow pass the assault weapon ban that the house has passed get it to the president s desk make sure the president signs it then we figure other things out but that s where we start tomorrow and do it quickly and show the country show the country for gosh sakes that that the that the people representing them in washington don t always kowtow to the gun lobby major garrett senator i know that s your point of view that s what you re advocating for you have a cell phone like everyone else in america are you getting any traffic on your cell phone from the democratic leadership or anyone else in washington suggesting to you what you just said is in fact likely to occur senator sherrod brown i am not hearing from any of my colleagues yet i called the mayor this morning i told you the mayor of dayton i i you know i i don t know i don t know if the gun lobby the gun lobby seems awfully strong i mean i ve been i ve had a lifetime f from the nra in a state that elects a lot of people that support the nra and that the nra supports but i know you can win elections you can stand up against the gun lobby and win elections i but that aside when is mitch mcconnell when is the republican leadership in the senate going to actually bring this to a vote the house of representatives passed it bipartisan it s a bipartisan bill in the house when is the senate actually going to do it and tomorrow is the perfect day i know that the senate adjourned for august a couple of days ago but bring us back have us do our job put this on the floor we know it works we know it s only it may only be a first step but we know it works and there s just simply no reason that mitch mcconnell won t do that except for the gun lobby major garrett briefly senator you know that some on the pro gun rights side of this ledger would say those things you outlined wouldn t stop every one of these wouldn t stop maybe even most of them your response senator sherrod brown well they re not going to stop every one of those nobody s ever contended they will but again i say that background check checks works we know that and the assault on the the the ban of assault weapons i mean this this this young man that killed nine people before the police killed him and injured i believe more than two dozen did that in the space the mayor told me did that in fewer than thirty seconds that says two things it says the police in dayton are terrific that they responded that quick and saved it says three things the police were terrific that saved second thing that saved hundreds of lives and third he had enough he had enough ammunition to kill potentially a hundred or two hundred people and that s why you ban the assault weapon and it worked when we banned it before it didn t stop every mass shooting it didn t stop every murder but a lot of people are alive today because we ve had background checks in some places and a lot of people are alive today because we had an assault ban for for i believe ten years in the major garrett ohio senator sherrod brown united states of america major garrett senator brown ohio democrat thank you former democratic congressman and 2020 presidential candidate beto o rourke joins us from el paso beto briefly you ve been there a short while what have you learned and how long will you stay in el paso beto o rourke 2020 democratic presidential candidate betoorourke i just came home yesterday and got to spend time with some of the victims and their families at university medical center not too far from where we are at the scene of the shooting right now extraordinarily courageous people and just an amazing strong community that s coming together in the face of this tragedy so very proud of el paso at this moment though deeply saddened and heartbroken by by what has taken place in in this community i m i m going to stay here through the course of the day continue to visit with families be at a vigil here tonight and do everything i can to ensure that el paso comes back as strong as poss as possible but also to ensure that we do everything that we can to guarantee that this does not happen again going forward and and it has to go well beyond thoughts and prayers and even beyond sensible gun legislation like universal background checks like ending the sales of weapons of war this is really about hatred and racism and intolerance that continues to grow in this country hate crime is on the rise for each of the last three years division being sown by this president s hatred being welcomed during his administration all of us must stand up against this and for a much better a much safer country major garrett are you saying president trump is indirectly responsible for this beto o rourke i m i m saying that president trump has a lot to do with what happened in el paso yesterday anybody who begins their campaign for the presidency by calling mexican immigrants rapists and criminals anyone who as president describes asylum seekers at the u s mexico border as an infestation or an invasion or animals anyone who describes those who do not match the majority of this country as somehow inherently dangerous or defective sows the kind of fear the kind of reaction that we saw in el paso yesterday so the answer major is is yes but it is also something that is much larger than this president and persisted here before his administration it s up to all of us to put an end to this racism and make sure that we don t just tolerate our differences but as we ve shown here in el paso we embrace them as the very source of our strength and our success and yes also our safety and our security major garrett you re no longer in congress but you have a voice should congress come back to washington and cancel the august recess to deal with this issue beto o rourke absolutely you know we re we re grieving here in el paso but but our hearts are also with the people of of dayton ohio gilroy in in california all across this country in in mass shootings like those that we saw here in el paso and the shootings that have become so numbingly common they don t even make the newscasts or the headlines of of the daily paper happening one or two at a time the fact that we will lose nearly forty thousand of of our fellow americans this year and every year until we change course demands an urgency that has been absolutely lacking from congress so let s follow the lead of of those students who are marching for our lives let s follow the lead of those moms who demand action let s follow the lead of those families here in el paso who i ve been listening to who demand the kind of change that we need congress should come back in session pass legislation the president should sign it into law but then we must also acknowledge that it has to go beyond that the kind of hatred and open racism that we re seeing in this country is having not just a corrosive result it s it s a deadly consequence and we saw that on full display in el paso yesterday major garrett one last thing before i let you go george p bush the land commissioner in texas wrote on twitter there have now been multiple attacks from self declared white terrorists here in the united states in the last several months this is a real and present threat your reaction beto o rourke he s absolutely right but he s got to take the next step and and describe why that threat exists in this country president trump who called white nationalists and klansmen and neo nazis very fine people after charlottesville who described the countries of africa as expletive deleted nations who said he wants more immigration from nordic countries the whitest places on on the planet the president not only tolerates but invites the kind of racism and hatred that that not only offends us but but changes who we are as a country and produces the kind of violence that we saw in el paso major garrett former congressman beto o rourke thank you we ll be back in a minute announcements major garrett we turn now to texas republican congressman will hurd who announced this week that he would not run for reelection in 2020 he is the eighth house republican this year to announce they are leaving elected office and he joins us this morning from san antonio congressman hurd good morning i know you know el paso well representative will hurd r texas hurdonthehill mm hm major garrett your district is right adjoining to it i think you have some familiarity with this walmart where this massacre occurred a couple of questions what have you heard from there are you going to el paso to join the vigil tonight and catch up with your former member of congress road trip mate beto o rourke representative will hurd well first of thanks for your coverage of of this tragedy and for any of your folks watching this this broadcast if you live in texas if you live in ohio if you live in new mexico go donate blood i mean you can get on the red cross website to figure out how to do this these communities need blood they are going to need it for the next couple of days and the next couple of weeks and and also if you see something on social media of someone talking about doing a heinous crime like this take a screenshot of it and share it with local law enforcement or the fbi s website we can all be vigilant to seeing this kind of hate and this kind of rhetoric and make sure law enforcement has the tools they need or the information in order to do something about it but el el paso is a resilient community you have a number of families that are still praying and and worried because their loved one is not out of the out of the proverbial woods yet that are still in critical condition you know the the youngest person that is injured was two years old her his the baby s mother was was killed she was only twenty five years old you know you have people that are in their eighties that are going through still in in hospitals as well and so this is a this is a trying time not just for el paso but but the rest of the country major garrett is this national moment where the federal legislature should be involved do you expect anything to happen over this august recess or do you expect just five weeks of silence from washington representative will hurd well the the the house of representatives have passed a background piece of legislation i was actually one of eight republicans that joined in that we should be preventing from putting guns in the hands of people that shouldn t have them that s pretty straightforward and simple but there s other things that we should be be looking at as well why does a young man from the suburbs think this is the way that he should do something that is a a trend that we have seen so so many times i have learned in in working with local law enforcement and federal law enforcement over the last couple of days on this issue that federal law enforcement is prevented from searching social media websites the public facing stuff about particular threats that s something that you don t need legislation to to fix when you look at the sequence of this attack in el paso and eventually in in ohio is there information sharing that could be improved between the federal government and local law enforcements does private security in these facilities have the training to do a suspicious activity report that they are doing suspicious activity reports where does that infor information go how are these folks ultimately getting radicalized the fbi is going to do their review law enforcement is going to do their review this is an act of terrorism terrorism is an act where you use violence against civilians for a political end and initial indications suggest that this is this is based on on race and and hatred which would be white nationalist terrorism why are people being being radicalized you can go back this shooter is in custody we are going to be able to learn a lot from him there was the shooting in charlestown a number of years ago that that killer learned he was doing web searches on trayvon martin and went down the rabbit hole of of white nationalism and racism and was self radicalized these are some of the issues that we re going to have to to review and yes congress has a role so does civil society so does the media this is an opportunity for us to focus on what unites us and not what divides us major garrett congressman what role does president trump play play in this you heard your former colleague beto o rourke say he invites and tolerates racism representative will hurd i think divisive rhetoric is is not the way to go i think he s denounced these these attacks he has an opportunity to be the uniter in chief and i hope that s the way to go but we can t just focus on just one person or just one entity this is a problem that has many sources and we need to be talking about all those sources in ways that every element of society can work on on dealing with this challenge major garrett your land commissioner george p bush called this white terrorism and says it presents a real and ongoing threat in this country do you agree representative will hurd i i agree and i would leave the the analysis of this this current activity this current shooting in el paso to the fbi i know they are evaluating it and believing it is is possibly a hate crime and fueled by this initial indication of this manifesto that the shooter shooter wrote suggests that and if it is in that is indeed confirmed then yes this is this is white nationalism terrorism and this is something that we re seeing and again i mentioned charleston as a perfect example i think we don t know enough about what happened in in ohio to suggest that that may be something similar but i know law and local law enforcement and federal law enforcement is going to be turning over every rock and and pursuing every lead but again i i think the thing that i ve learned in in my time representing a very diverse district seventy one percent latino a fifty fifty district is that way more unites us than divides us major garrett right representative will hurd and when we focus on those things that unite us we re going to be better off major garrett congressman we want to continue this conversation that s why we re not going to let you go please stay right there we just need to take a quick break but we ll be right back with congressman will hurd announcements major garrett please be sure to listen to my podcast it s called the takeout available on all podcast platforms and our digital streaming news service known as cbsn new episodes premiere every friday morning stay with us we ll have more of our conversation with republican congressman will hurd and a conversation with south carolina republican senator tim scott announcements major garrett we will be right back a lot more of face the nation including our continuing conversation with congressman will hurd republican of texas and south carolina republican senator tim scott plus our all star panel please stay with us announcements major garrett welcome back to face the nation and more with texas republican will hurd so congressman you ran in 2018 as you ve said it s a very competitive district you won hillary clinton carried your district in 2016 why not run in 2020 are you afraid of the effect that president trump will have on those prospects representative will hurd no i i i m interested in in helping other candidates like me i i think i want to see a a republican party that has more folks that that look and and sound and operate like i do i think it s an opportunity for me to help you know phenomenal candidates like wesley hunt down in houston texas he cares about his country served his country in the military has a major garrett but representative will hurd beautiful young family worked in in the the private sector major garrett but but congressman representative will hurd and wants to continue to serve so so major garrett congressman you know representative will hurd yes sir major garrett you know the way to do that is to stay to raise money to campaign alongside and say he s joining me not i am leaving and he needs to replace me representative will hurd well what what i find interesting and a lot of people have asked me that question is that everybody thinks the end all or be all is actually being in congress the party is defined by the people that are in it not necessarily the politicians and so this gives me the freedom and flexibility to operate in other parts of the country i m also going to stay involved in that nexus of technology and law enforcement you can do that outside of the the halls of congress when you look at issues like artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence is important because whoever matches it is going to rule the world and the the most interesting things that s happening in in that area is outside of of the federal government so i m looking forward to to continuing to serve my country i left a job as an undercover officer in the cia a job i loved i got to be the guy in the back alleys at four o clock in the morning collecting intelligence on threats to our homeland i left that job in order to help the the the national security community in a different way by bringing my skills to congress and i m going to be leaving the halls of congress to help you know our country in a different way as well major garrett before it representative will hurd so i m i m excited about the the next couple of months because we still have a lot of work to do major garrett congressman hurd representative will hurd in congress but i m also looking forward to building a republican party of the future major garrett before i let you go john ratcliffe a colleague of yours was for a very brief period of time suggested by the president to be the new leader of the director of national intelligence he s now pulled out how concerned were you about that potential nomination itself and how concerned are you about the general state of the intelligence community without a leader and with the president and the white house appearing undeci indecisive about how to replace outgoing dni dan coats representative will hurd well john ratcliffe is is my friend john ratcliffe is someone that i have been able to talk to as our in our time on on the house permanent select committee on intelligence he is ab ability to to digest vast amounts of of information which is a skillset that s needed within the dni and and i m sorry that this thing turned out the way it did i think sue gordon as an acting director of national intelligence is an excellent choice i ve had the opportunity to work with her in the different roles she has played in in national security but this position of of director of national intelligence has a lot of challenges the existential threat that china is playing to us major garrett right representative will hurd you know dealing with disinformation and how the russians were trying to influence our elections and of course continuing to deal with terrorism overseas major garrett right representative will hurd and abroad major garrett congressman hurd thank you very much and thank you for staying for that extra segment i want to let our audience know is that law enforcement sources tell cbs news that dayton shooter has been identified as connor betts twenty four year old from bellbrook ohio police are searching his home presently thank you for being with us congressman hurd as i said we ll be right back with south carolina republican senator tim scott announcements major garrett welcome back we turn now to south carolina republican senator tim scott who joins us this morning from mount pleasant just outside of charleston senator good morning and i want you to help our audience senator tim scott r south carolina senatortimscott good morning garrett major garrett because you ve worked through this you ve been through this as an elected leader and as someone deeply touched in a community that has suffered a mass shooting describe for my audience for our audience what el paso and dayton are about to go through senator tim scott well what a challenging time our prayers and our thoughts are certainly with both communities in south carolina here in charleston my hometown at the mother emanuel church a white racist walked into the doors sat through a bible study for more than an hour and then executed nine members my friend clementa pinckney was the pastor my uncle had attended that church for over fifty years so i am intimately aware of the challenges and the sense of disillusionment that comes in the aftermath the the good news for our community was that our community came together through prayer a lot of folks say that prayers don t matter well i will disagree with them vehemently because of prayer the five the nine family members forgave the shooter and brought unity into our state in a way that we have not seen in the history of the state frankly the civil war started in charleston and to have a white racist walk into a door of a black church to start according to his objective a race riot to have the actual opposite occur because of the power of faith in that church and in our community was fantastic and phenomenal walking out of that situation what we d started doing was meeting and talking and finding out where the differences were so that we could challenge ourselves to overcome those differences and we did something that i thought was incredibly important we said to each other that when you hear someone who looks like you say something that is out of line or inconsistent or insensitive make it your responsibility to respond to that individual within your own community that really did resonate here at home and it was very powerful and very helpful because when we re looking for ways to address the challenges that our nation is seeing all over the place one of the things that we do we must take individual responsibility and speak up when we hear something silence in and of itself is a part of the challenge so we must speak up when we see things that are out of place when we hear things that are inconsistent with that that that s in the best interest of our nation and our communities major garrett senator scott on that topic you mentioned sent silence and that s not acceptable i want to read to you a quote from a book that just was published by tim alberta called american carnage it relates a conversation you had with president trump i want to quote from it directly i know what fear looks like i think fear typically comes with anger and hostility you re afraid that you re losing something that you won t have something that you used to have i think people who march with torches who want to resurrect a thankfully dead part of who we were these are people who are afraid trump took all this in rarely interrupting what can i do to be helpful he finally asked what would you say to president trump this morning about what he has said the atmosphere he has created and in his words what he can do to be more helpful senator tim scott well the first thing i would say is that we need to take a step back from the from politicizing every event this is a issue of human hate something that resides in the heart and that is actually unfortunately because of social technology and the social media we re seeing it connect it to other folks who have hate in their heart as well what i d say to everyone from the president to to my house is that we should take responsibility for how we respond to the situations i am thankful that the president s response to the situation has been clear and decisive i would hope that we would always have that clarity and decisive response in the face of hate and rage and racism but it goes beyond that we have to build a better society a society where we all see that we are in the same boat poking holes or shooting holes in that boat only leads to casualties all of us will be the casualty everyone looks in this world to america as a city on the hill the bright light within the stars we have to act consistent with our values if we are to maintain the position not as a superpower economically but as a moral compass for this world to follow i think we can do that i know that we have done it and i believe that we will do it again major garrett i don t know if you had a chance to hear it but sherrod brown earlier on this program said he hopes the senate will cancel the august recess come back and address gun related issues your colleague in south carolina lindsey graham tweeted this morning he is now in favor of so called red flag laws do you have any anticipation senator scott that that will occur the senate will be called back this august and any legislative efforts will be undertaken whether it s assault weapons ban background checks or red flag laws or should they be senator tim scott well garrett it s a great question i don t have a clear answer for that something that i would be happy to do i d happy to be happily come back to washington to have a conversation about gun violence major garrett right now senator tim scott and i hope we d do it in a very thorough way i i d do it tonight i d leave tonight i ll i ll go tomorrow it doesn t matter to me this is such an important issue and an issue that we sometimes only get part of the picture because of the mass shootings i heard one of your guests earlier talk about the fact that we had nearly forty thousand gun related deaths in this country that is a staggering number and when you delve into the numbers what you find is that sixty five to sixty seven percent of those murders were self inflicted they were suicides when you look at the two hundred and fifty plus mass shootings in this country this year about seventeen to twenty of them led to the loss of four lives or more about half of those were suicides and or domestic situations we are in the midst of a mental health crisis that we have not truly identified i am happy to talk about background checks i have supported letters to the administration that eliminated bump stocks i am willing to have that conversation but let s make sure that we put a fine point on the actual place the numbers lead us and wherever that goes we should be willing to take a serious look at it major garrett i just want to make sure i understand you clearly senator scott your message this morning to the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is come back bring us back and let s have a conversation on these various issues right now senator tim scott garrett it is it is painful to watch the challenges that i ve lived through and to suggest that for some reason we re not willing to go back and confront this major issue in our nation i reject that i reject the notion that something is more important than saving lives if we can do so i m not going to suggest that we will find ourselves on the same page having the same answers from left or right but i do think that it is an american crisis that we are part of and as leaders of this country we have an opportunity to go back and and deal with the issue and i hope that we find the the resolve to take apart the issue and and not just deal with one silo i am willing to look at the entire ugly picture and look for solutions that our nation desperately learn yearns for major garrett republican senator tim scott of south carolina thank you so very much for your time and we ll be right back with our panel announcements major garrett as we do every week about this time we would like to bring in our panel for some political analysis susan page is the washington bureau chief at usa today jeffrey goldberg is the editor in chief of the atlantic amy walter is the national editor of the cook political report and the host of the the takeaway podcast on conversation rather on wnyc which is not to be confused with my own podcast here at cbs known as the takeout that was a long way around for not very much anyway david nakamura is also a reporter covering the white house for the washington post good morning everyone i don t need to say it s a tough morning and i don t want to go through one of these banalities about well we re all so concerned i just want to get a sense from you collectively i ll start with you susan our nation has been through this process before and every time we ask this question is there a moment is this a moment what do you think susan page usa today susanpage if if two hundred and forty nine mass shootings in the space of a year is not enough to force political change why would the two hundred and fiftieth one be yeah jeffrey reminded me that he and i sat at this table on this panel the morning after the tree of life shooting at the synagogue in pittsburgh and we had no particular answers then and i don t know that we have anymore answers now about why this would be the turning point that so many americans say they want to see major garrett jeffrey jeffrey goldberg the atlantic jeffreygoldberg well you know right after sandy hook a number of people observed that what we learned is that the country will accept a certain level of child homicide in order to have the the the gun rights that we have in place and other issues so things didn t change after that so it s hard to imagine that things change after any particular event this does feel a little bit different because it s the confluence of a gun issue and a racism issue and both of those seem to be reaching a boiling point but it s hard to say that this is a a pivot we might be pivoting toward an end to euphemism in some way people are seem to be tired of talking about thoughts and prayers this idea of having a national conversation around every issue seems inadequate to the moment but we ll see major garrett amy do you take anything of significance away from tweets this morning from fred upton republican michigan in the house lindsey graham republican in south carolina talking about red flag laws finding some place to reposition themselves within this conversation amy walter cook political report amyewalter well i also think it goes beyond the legislative and i think we all are on the table know that too that the issue really when we re talking about the consequences of political rhetoric and where the incentives are people like will hurd aren t coming back to congress in part i know he didn t say this but it it can t be much fun to be somebody like congressman hurd he is one of only three republicans who sit in a district that hillary clinton carried so now there will be maybe after 2020 only two left in districts that hillary clinton carried those are the folks that bring a diversity of ideas who are there to sort of raise their hand and say well it might play in your district but it doesn t play here and to bring that kind of conversation but that doesn t happen anymore the people who are willing to compromise those people have all been either defeated or they ve left on their own and so what that leaves us with is an incentive structure in washington where it s all or none i mean this conversation isn t in some ways isn t that hard to have but we can t have it because there s no and or but into the conversation so either you have it s either mental health issues or it s we have to get rid of all guns right you there s somewhere in between here and there s also the consequence of the the rhetoric and i think that s going to be it s obviously been a big issue thus far under president trump s tenure but that there are actual consequences to stoking and inflaming president trump didn t invent this polarization but the constant just stoking of it has actual consequences david nakamura the washington post davidnakamura absolutely i mean this is a president i think in 2016 there was some general sense with if if there was a president given his conservative bona fides for president trump the way he campaigned that he could somehow give cover to some republicans on something like gun control amy walter yeah david nakamura find you know some common ground as as unlikely as that might be this would be a possible president who could do something like that he has shown no inclination to do so major garrett right the idea being republicans will follow him just about anywhere as will the base david nakamura right and i think what you re saying though amy walter that s right david nakamura this particular case if this manifesto is indeed tied to the shooter in the case in el paso is that president trump is this is beyond an issue of mass shooting it s now tied up into questions about white nationalism about the president s rhetoric and about trump trumpism in an election year so the idea that we can move forward and president trump would be the one to give lindsey graham and others the political cover seems extremely unlikely major garrett i am a little uncomfortable with the word manifesto i think it invests a kind of credibility that this essay doesn t i think warrant but be that as it may and once authorities and they are on this trail now believe they can confirm that the two are linked in it it says the increase in hispanic population in texas prompted his action blames democrat and republican leaders and corporations for failing the country specifies that neither president trump nor any other presidential candidate inspired him expressed his support for the christchurch shooter in new zealand jeffrey this is an impossible question to answer but i m going to give you a chance jeffrey goldberg oh thank you major garrett not what can we what ought we conclude about it but what does this tell us possibly that we should think about and maybe act on jeffrey goldberg it tells us that that the another term that might be antiquated now is lone wolf after you have so many lone wolves it s it s a wolf pack it s not connected in the same way as say isis or al qaeda structured organizations but there is a a common viewpoint shared by different white males in different parts of the world about the condition of the world social media has allowed this to to grow mostly unnoticed people are you don t need a terror organization anymore when people can connect their ideas to each other across social media across the internet and so we are in a we re in a completely different kind of challenge for law enforcement where people are neither radicalized by organizational structures but they re not self radicalized either there s so much help and so i mean i agree with you on the manife it s a screed and what it is a screed it s a pastiche of ideas that have been floating around in the netherworld of the internet and and these young minds are putting these ideas together and some are taking action susan page and we had we had a warning of this last month the fbi director chris wray testified before congress that the fbi had investigated nearly one hundred instances this year of domestic terrorism and most of them were associated in some way with white nationalism and the only reason this testimony didn t get more attention i think is because it was right before robert mueller was testifying about the the russia investigation but that is a pretty sobering message nearly as many examples of domestic terrorism being pursued by the fbi as international terrorism inside our border major garrett george p bush is the land commissioner of texas the grandson of george herbert walker bush the son of jeb bush very quick on twitter to describe his career in afghanistan as a naval officer quoting him directly on twitter there have now been multiple attacks from self declared white terrorists here in the u s in the last several months this is a real and present threat that we must all denounce and defeat amy do you think that is singularly suggestive of the bush family writ large and do you think it will be something that republicans like will hurd and others will rally around amy walter so george p bush is in texas a state that is obviously incredibly diverse if he wants to run for higher office in the state of texas he understands and appreciates what that would look like the coalition that you need to put together to win in a state like texas and the age that he is right now he s much younger knowing where we re going we re headed in the future so i think he reflects where where the party needs to go but right now in the age of trump they are in a place where that s not true i just wanted to give one statistic right now in congress republicans represent eighty three percent of of of the hundred districts with the highest share of native born residents so places that have the highest share of non native born residents are held by democrats almost exclusively major garrett david it sounds like george p bush is thinking about the future and is suggesting with this tweet it seems to me and to pick up on amy s point that though this may be the current trajectory he does not believe it is the long term trajectory as a republican party david nakamura sure i mean there s democrats that go back even back to obama days that talked about you know trying to embed in texas to help it turn blue i think though you know more immediately of course i was reminded just that president trump himself visited el paso the same time he gave a speech there and if you look i went and looked back at his speech it talked about his his immigration agenda did not mention almost anything about the positive aspects of immigration certainly and also you know recited a number of statistics that were inflated and inaccurate about the dangers of immigrants and undocumented immigrants he called juarez mexico right across the border one of the most dangerous cities in the world he inflated the number of murders and violent crimes among immigrants this is a president if you if you think about it too beyond just talking about a caravan invasion he talked about an emergency at the border that he had to act and if you look at sort of the the language of this the screed or whatever you want to call it that s that was most posted online by the potentially by the alleged shooter it it echoes quite a bit of that major garrett jeffrey jeffrey goldberg just as to one note on george p bush let s let s credit him with electoral acumen but let s also credit george p bush and other people in the bush family and other republicans with being genuinely horrified by the ethno nationalist tilt of the republican party and especially its president i mean i think that there are numbers large numbers of people many of whom have left congress recently who don t like the way this is going and don t like the association of the republican party with the kind of white nationalism major garrett susan susan page we know over the long term major garrett about twenty seconds susan page we know over the long term this is a losing proposition for the republican party to give up on black members to give up on hispanic voters but what we don t know is whether it works in the short term in next year s election major garrett susan page thank you very much we ll be right back announcements major garrett that s it for us today as we leave we want to thank the first responders and authorities who have acted so heroically in both el paso and dayton and to the families and friends neighbors and acquaintances of the victims you have our deepest sympathies for your losses margaret will be back next week for face the nation i m major garrett watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network
