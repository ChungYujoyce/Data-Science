 2016 the sanders campaign contends a long slog will be good for hillary clinton other democrats worry it delays the necessary turn to donald trump by annie karni 03 05 2016 09 45 pm est updated 03 05 2016 10 35 pm est vermont sen bernie sanders speaks at a rally at the macomb community college in warren michigan on march 5 ap photo even as wins in the kansas and nebraska caucuses appeared to revive the flagging bernie sanders campaign hillary clinton was trying to preemptively stop it hours before the results were declared saturday the clinton campaign announced its pledged delegate lead had grown to 199 on super tuesday larger than barack obama s highest margin during the 2008 primary and a stockpile that makes it very difficult for bernie sanders to catch up advertisement clinton s delegate lead only increased with her thumping victory in the louisiana primary even as sanders prepared to add yet another small caucus state to his column maine which votes sunday is expected to throw its support behind sanders too clinton operatives have yet to make any overt calls for the vermont senator to suspend his campaign as his path to the nomination becomes narrower but since clinton s blowout victory in south carolina late last month the campaign has continually highlighted the delegate math hoping the deficit will make the argument itself now sanders has a difficult path to the nomination and no apparent eagerness to drop out his top aides and supporters began making a new argument to justify the long slog it s great for clinton it s not an opinion necessarily shared in her circles clinton insiders are eager to begin recruiting to their cause republicans turned off by the prospect of donald trump and the threat of sanders sticking it out until june makes the general election pivot more difficult but even if sanders can t win his operatives contend his participation in the process will boost turnout among democratic voters and keeps clinton in the news the alternative they argue is ceding months of headlines to trump and the fractured republican party it s important to vigorously contest these contests and bernie sanders is capable of bringing millions of new people into the process said sanders senior strategist tad devine citing exit polls from massachusetts a super tuesday state clinton won that showed 17 percent of voters were new to the process and those voters overwhelmingly supported sanders democratic turnout could be a time bomb for the party about 3 million fewer democrats voted in the 15 states that held primaries or caucuses through march 1 than did in 2008 meanwhile trump s candidacy has turned out droves of new voters if bernie can turn out voters all across america that s very important for the nominee it s important for democrats up and down the ballot devine said if not you cede the ground to the opposition in the months ahead and they re putting on quite a show if you look at john mccain in 2008 you can see that argument makes a lot of sense in the 2008 race devine said when clinton and obama engaged in a primary that lasted through june mccain was forgotten about and eclipsed that s a factor they should consider and unlike the republicans bernie sanders is not engaging in these gross personal attacks it can be very constructive in 2008 however devine seemed to make a different argument about the value of an extended primary in an appearance on hardball with chris matthews that year he said of the raging primary battle between clinton and obama if this race degenerates it will hurt who the nominee is how constructive the rest of the primary stands to be is a looming question for clinton as long as she is winning and as long as she isn t forced to constantly try and maneuver to the left of bernie sanders it s not a bad thing former mitt romney strategist kevin madden said of sanders remaining in the race that s the biggest risk that bernie sanders has posed and could continue to pose which is that a number of times during this campaign hillary clinton has been forced to abandon the centrist clinton brand to try and out liberal an avowed socialist leading into the weekend sanders was still playing offense just before clinton s big jobs speech in detroit on friday his campaign released the transcript of a speech she delivered in india as secretary of state talking up the benefits of outsourcing jobs abroad so far clinton s campaign has interpreted many of sanders attacks as a stealth campaign to raise questions about her authenticity and character but other progressives agreed that a tussle over the issues would be positive for clinton democrats could go dark for weeks as donald trump gets tons of election night airtime with the winner label attributed to him over and over again uninterrupted said adam green co founder of the progressive change campaign committee steve schmidt who served as chief strategist for mccain s failed 2008 bid disagreed with devine s argument that the prolonged democratic battle hurts the republican nominee there are two finite commodities on a political campaign time and money schmidt said the more time you have the more money you can raise the notion that you are better off in being delayed in being able to turn to the general election is wrong the spring months he said would be better used building the billion dollar organizing infrastructure needed to hone a general election message and win in november 2016 by patrick reis some republican operatives also said they expected between 35 percent and 40 percent of the gop electorate to walk on trump if he becomes the party s nominee and clinton needs to move to the middle to begin reaching out to those voters and convincing them we agree on more than you think in recent weeks clinton ally and correct the record founder david brock has been pushing the idea within clinton circles that the trend lines in the republican race present a big opportunity for a gop crossover vote for clinton and that there should be an organized effort to help make that happen last week for instance former republican new jersey gov christine todd whitman said she would support clinton over trump a move that is expected to be a gateway for other republican voters to follow suit but with clinton stuck in a battle against sanders she faces him in a debate sunday night in flint michigan and will debate him again wednesday in miami it s harder to begin making the pivot sen sanders remaining in the race allows his anti wall street anti elite rhetoric to target clinton constantly said democratic strategist hank sheinkopf bernie sanders helps trump the angry populist every day he remains a candidate missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and
