on this face the nation broadcast moderated by margaret brennan clickhereto browse full transcripts of face the nation margaret brennan it s sunday august 11th i m margaret brennan and this is face the nation a week after two mass shootings that killed thirty one and wounded fifty four anger over gun violence and the motivations behind it is at a boiling point across the country crowd in unison enough is enough margaret brennan and especially on the campaign trail joe biden who in god s name needs a weapon that can handle a hundred rounds for god s sake margaret brennan despite the accusations about who s to blame for inflaming the hate that prompted them kamala harris people say to me did donald trump cause those those folks to be killed well no of course he didn t pull the trigger but he certainly been tweeting out the ammunition margaret brennan there are sober reminders that gun violence touches all even presidential candidates stephanie my beautiful four year old daughter dayla was struck by a stray bullet march 2011 my son my daughter s twin brother witnessed what happened that day she died two days later andrew yang i have a six and three year old boy i was imagining i was imagining it was one of them that got shot and the other saw it i m so sorry pete buttigieg el paso walmart el paso texas oregon historic district dayton ohio these are less than half of the mass shootings in my lifetime it is time to do something different margaret brennan but after years of failing to get gun control measures passed on a national level what bill that s different could get through congress and get signed by the president president donald trump but we have to have meaningful background checks i m talking about meaningful add that word meaningful margaret brennan we ll hear from all sides former mayor michael bloomberg hosted a candidate forum saturday in iowa to push for gun control we spoke with him there red flag laws those were in place in connecticut before sandy hook they didn t stop that massacre michael bloomberg no but they stopped some things margaret brennan background checks would not have stopped these two shooters from getting these guns michael bloomberg okay that is true no one law is going to stop everything margaret brennan we ll talk with the number two republican in the house louisiana s steve scalise he was critically injured when a gunman attacked republican members of congress during a baseball practice in 2017 we ll also hear from three presidential candidates senators bernie sanders michael bennet and kirsten gillibrand and as always we ll have political analysis on all the news of the week coming up on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation we begin with the question on everyone s minds a week after mass shootings in texas and ohio what can be done to prevent these in the future former new york mayor michael bloomberg who founded the gun control advocacy group everytown for gun safety hosted a candidate forum in des moines yesterday we spoke with him there and began by asking if he thinks congress will pass a background check bill when they return in the fall begin vt michael bloomberg former new york city mayor mikebloomberg i m optimistic it still depends on mitch mcconnell bringing a bill to the floor in the senate and it still depends on the president of the united states signing a bill i think that the more you see things like this event where if i d done this ten years ago we wouldn t have gotten any democratic candidates for president to come today almost all the twenty are here that they see the public has said enough is enough and that s why we re here and that s the impact is not just on the democratic party which you may well remember the democrats were cowed by the nra as well for a long time although today in all fairness they re not it s the time is to say we just have to stop this margaret brennan you ve said that when you launched this group that just like the nra we need to make them afraid of us that is going out there and challenging politicians who don t support this kind of platform michael bloomberg what i did in the 2018 election was we supported twenty four candidates for congress the criteria were they had to be good on guns and good on the environment margaret brennan you spent about a hundred million dollars michael bloomberg spent about a hundred million dollars and twenty one of the twenty four won and replaced a rated congress people from the nra nra a rated the nra takes no prisoners whatsoever and they lost twenty one seats in the house flipped the house and so now is the time to start working and helping the republicans to see the light because i don t think this is a partisan issue margaret brennan so what does this mean for 2020 are you going to go out there and fund candidates to challenge those who michael bloomberg we ll see margaret brennan don t fund or vote for things like background checks or red flag laws michael bloomberg it is very early and the best thing would be that we have action in congress on the republican senate side as well as the democratic house side so that you won t be able to ask that question because we will already be where we want to be margaret brennan but is this a a threat or warning from you michael bloomberg there s no question that i think this is one of the real key issues in our country we cannot have a society where you go out in the street and you can get blown away it s just not tolerable we we just have to say enough is enough margaret brennan you ve said that essentially the nra model of taking people directly on if they are not supporting your platform should be replicated michael bloomberg i think that should be margaret brennan if if mitch mcconnell doesn t michael bloomberg but if everything margaret brennan bring this to the floor in the fall will you look at funding his michael bloomberg mitch margaret brennan opposition michael bloomberg mitch mcconnell is up for re election and he s running against somebody who i m told is an attractive candidate mitch mcconnell is going to look and say what does the public want as well so i am optimistic that even mitch will change his mind i hope so margaret brennan red flag laws those were in place in connecticut before sandy hook they didn t stop that massacre michael bloomberg no but they stopped some things margaret brennan background checks would not have stopped these two shooters from getting these guns at least as currently written michael bloomberg okay that is true no one law is going to stop everything but there s just no question when you put in background checks suicides with with guns and murder rates go down when you get rid of assault weapons you stop the mass murders these are not public health things this is too much of a access to to to guns and particularly to assault weapons which were designed to kill the maximum number of people as quickly as possible and as gruesomely as you could possibly do it margaret brennan the nra has been having some internal disputes and problems they were the largest donor to michael bloomberg i noticed that margaret brennan to president trump michael bloomberg what a shame margaret brennan in 2016 will they be able to bankroll to the level they did in 2020 i mean michael bloomberg i think margaret brennan do you see an opportunity michael bloomberg i think the nra has been very badly hurt by this the nra ninety percent of nra members are in favor of background checks so the nra is not in the place of most of its members and in fact if you go back you can see wayne lapierre who runs the nra testifying before congress in favor of background checks fifteen or twenty years ago wayne lapierre 1999 we think it s reasonable to provide for instant gun checks at shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops michael bloomberg they ve changed their views they went towards away from background checks the time is for them to come back and if they want to be an organization rent representing gun owners that s fine nothing wrong with that but we they should not be somebody representing the view that everybody has the right to go kill everybody margaret brennan well i i want to ask you about some of the choices the candidates are making joe biden has said the president encourages white supremacism bernie sanders said the president s a racist elizabeth warren said he is stirring up racial conflict beto o rourke said he is making the risk of violence like this in el paso more real do you think that it s a mistake for democrats to tie the president s rhetoric to these mass killings michael bloomberg no i think words matter people look to their leadership for guidance and to say that it doesn t have an effect is wrong so what the president says is very important and if he supports or says nice things about racists it encourages racism if he goes and says nice things about white supremacists he encourages that kind of violence he s just i hope he understands this he cannot go and just have shoot off his mouth and say anything he s the president of the united states margaret brennan you decided not to run for president is there anything that would make you reconsider michael bloomberg no i don t think so i thought about it a little bit when i was driving into des moines today thinking you know i ve thought had i came here and i spent a good chunk of a month meeting the people of this great state and in some senses i miss being on the campaign trail i ran i had three elections i won them all i know how to put together a team i know how to put together a team not just to win elections i know how to put together a team to actually deliver the services you promise but i did that and now it s time to do something else margaret brennan can democrats win if they bill themselves as progressives michael bloomberg i think if you are very progressive no i think the public wants evolutionary change not revolutionary change margaret brennan do you think that democrats need a new generation michael bloomberg i think there s an awful lot to be said for experience and accomplishment there s a value to having been there done that and to understand if there was simple solutions to complex problems we would have solved those problems i m not a believer that oh there s a new generation coming along and they own the right to set the agenda i think you earn your spurs and you earn the right to set an agenda by showing people that what you ve been doing is working margaret brennan you have business in china and you know michael bloomberg yes margaret brennan business people for decades have been complaining about china not playing fair michael bloomberg that s correct margaret brennan president trump s been really aggressive michael bloomberg correct margaret brennan on this you don t like the tactics but is he doing what is needed on this front and how do democrats say that they are going to be stronger michael bloomberg people that think donald trump will have is not re electable are wrong i think a lot of people look at exactly what he is doing with china and they think he s at least taking on the chinese and they should be taken on is their belief now i would argue some of the things he says are right that we really shouldn t have this asymmetrical trade relationship but you don t do it by walking up and having public fights you don t do it by changing your mind all the time you don t do it by being a bully with tariffs so it s the president s methods of trying to deal with china that i object to not the fact that they have the chinese have their interests we have ours margaret brennan you think he may be re elected michael bloomberg i hope not i will i m sure support somebody who s running against him in the end but i think to anybody that thinks that he does not have support is badly misinterpreting what the public believes there is a revolution that has been taking place around the world where the public thinks that the establishment has not recognized their needs and you see that in donald trump getting elected you see that in brexit you see that in a lot of things where we re doing things differently and the old line stuff is being thrown out and that s not necessarily good margaret brennan our full interview with mayor bloomberg is available on our website facethenation com we did invite the nra s wayne lapierre to appear on the broadcast but he declined our invitation we now turn to the number two republican in the house steve scalise he joins us this morning from new orleans good morning congressman representative steve scalise r louisiana stevescalise republican whip good morning margaret good to be with you margaret brennan president trump says he wants meaningful background checks why aren t you supporting him on that representative steve scalise well first of all i have supported him on that and in fact we got a bill to president trump s desk last year the fix nics bill which truly does go after some of the real problems we saw where people were falling through the cracks and not getting into the background margaret brennan but he wanted something new and now representative steve scalise check system like so many shootings like charleston like others well the president said he wants to make sure especially that people with mental illnesses don t get guns and in fact there were a lot of people that we were finding that weren t getting put into the system we need to keep working on that and make the background check system work better we passed a very bipartisan bill to do just that and donald trump signed it into law just last year let s focus on making that work better so a lot of these people that slip through the cracks don t don t slip through the cracks again or in future attempts where they might try to do that margaret brennan does that mean that you do not expect republicans to support or vote for new legislation on background checks representative steve scalise well first of all let s see what bills are being brought forward i know what nancy pelosi called for the senate to come back and vote on was a bill that they passed through the house or two bills that wouldn t have actually done anything to stop these shootings because the shooters in in both in el paso and in dayton passed background checks so her bill wouldn t apply to them but her bill is very dangerous in a number of ways of how it stops law abiding people from being able to transfer guns including if you loan your gun to your neighbor because she s afraid that her ex boyfriend is going to come and beat her up you loaning your gun to her would put you in federal in not in federal put you in prison for up to a year that s what pelosi s bill does wouldn t have stopped the shootings but actually makes it harder for law abiding citizens to do things that are currently legal and frankly currently helping improve safety margaret brennan do you think domestic terrorism should be a federal crime representative steve scalise i do and in fact i applaud what s being done both at the fbi and with our new acting homeland security secretary his first week in office he put in place a task force to go look at a lot of the online recruiting that s going on to radicalize people we re seeing a very alarming increase in domestic terrorism the fbi has been focused on that last month alone they saw it was in the hundreds the number of domestic terrorism cases that they re looking at so we need to make sure that the fbi and the department of homeland security have the tools they need to go and root out whether it s white supremacists whether it s radicals from the left that are committing some of these crimes margaret brennan but what tools representative steve scalise we need to make sure that they margaret brennan do you think republicans representative steve scalise have the tools they need to root it out margaret brennan what tools will republicans vote to give law enforcement what what are you suggesting there representative steve scalise well first of all if you look at what the fbi just set up recently and what the homeland security secretary just did recently to put a renewed focus on this to put a new focus on what s going on online the recruiting that we all know has been going on online they are actually focusing on it they do need more tools they ve asked for more resources we have a budget process that s coming up when we return in september let s make sure that in the budget process that is a very high priority because right now it s not a high enough priority we need to make sure it is margaret brennan we ll have to wait till the fall to see what comes up but i do want to ask you because you ve voiced some concern about tone and conversation about these killings in this country in the case of el paso it is the largest anti latino attack this country has ever seen the killer said that he went to a border town to kill mexicans given this particular context can you understand the sensitivity to language used by the president when he refers to migrants as invading this country representative steve scalise well first of all i i my heart breaks as everybody s does when you see what happened there s no place for it whether it s somebody that s racist that that hates a certain ethnic group there s no place for those kind of attacks and attacking people based on on their ethnicity but to try to assign blame to somebody else i think is a very slippery slope because the president s no more responsible for that shooting as your next guest bernie sanders is for my shooting and he s not by the way responsible the shooter is responsible what we need to do is find out those people that have slipped through the cracks and we ve seen it in shooting after shooting sutherland springs charleston even in dayton he had a hit list and a rape list and yet none of that was in the system let s make sure these background check systems work properly and are rooting out the people that shouldn t be able to legally purchase a gun but currently are because the system hasn t worked margaret brennan so you have not advised the president to reconsider some of his words that many in the hispanic community consider inflammatory representative steve scalise well first of all the president was very clear just the other day that there s no place for this he spoke out against racism he spoke out against these kind of attacks and so to try to assign blame you know go look at some of these presidential candidates who made some of the most ridiculous statements i mean joe biden just said that he was vice president when the parkland kids margaret brennan right representative steve scalise came and met with him he wasn t vice president you know so some of these things that are being said are are beyond ridiculous i i know they re running for president and they might not like donald trump s views but stop this this ridiculous assessment of blame to somebody other than the person who s responsible margaret brennan mm hm representative steve scalise and again you know just just you talk to to other people who were motivators look at the dayton shooter and what his motivations were is anybody asking about that anybody from the left margaret brennan okay representative steve scalise who he was inspired by there s no right there s no place for it the shooter s margaret brennan so you re representative steve scalise responsible let s try to identify these shooters in a better way which right now we re working on doing let s put more emphasis there margaret brennan i want to give you a chance to respond to what mayor bloomberg said about the nra he said it should be a group allowed to represent the gun lobby but not to represent the view that everybody has the right to go kill everybody do you think the nra is out of touch with some of its members who do support background checks and that it s been weakened representative steve scalise well first of all you know the nra has millions of supporters and and people that are actual members just like any other group that can advocate for an issue they re advocating for something that s in the united states constitution the second amendment but let s look at some of the things that michael bloomberg has talked about you know he says he wants a better background check system yet every single person that he defeated last year that he spent over about a hundred million dollars of his money to defeat voted to fix the background check system last year so what s his real motivation i mean he literally spent about a hundred million dollars of his money for members of congress who voted yes to fix the background system and close the background check system and close these loopholes so so again i mean i i m sure he says certain things but what is his real motivation when he spent that much money to defeat people who voted to fix this system and by the way margaret name one single bill that nancy pelosi put on barack obama s desk when they had the house senate and the white house to address any of these issues there was not one bill she put on his desk we ve put a bill on donald trump s desk last year to fix the nics system the background check system and he signed it into law and is actually working to make it address those loopholes the people that fell through the cracks and he banned bump stocks which were used in the las vegas shooting those by the way were legalized when barack obama was president donald trump is the one who said this shouldn t happen he banned bump stocks and they re not legal anymore margaret brennan congressman scalise thank you for joining us we ll be back in one minute with senator bernie sanders he s standing by live in iowa announcements margaret brennan moving on to campaign 2020 senator bernie sanders joins us from the campaign trail in greenfield iowa senator good morning senator bernie sanders i vermont berniesanders 2020 democratic presidential candidate good morning margaret margaret brennan i want to give you a chance to respond to congressman scalise who brought up the fact that the man who shot him back in 2017 had been a volunteer for your campaign he said he doesn t blame you and therefore by the same token no one should blame president trump for the shootings that we ve seen in the past few days how do you respond senator bernie sanders look as as soon as i possibly could i was on the floor of the senate condemning that action what we are is a nonviolent political movement i condemn all forms of violence you know we had thirteen million people voting for us and i m afraid i can t just tell you that every one of them was the kind of people kind of person that i would like but we must bring about the fundamental changes that this country requires in health care in education in climate change we do it in an absolutely nonviolent way margaret brennan but do you believe and in some of your language in recent days you you ve said president trump is a racist you ve called him a xenophobe senator bernie sanders yes yes margaret brennan do you believe he is directly or indirectly responsible for what happened in el paso senator bernie sanders he create look president trump and nobody else wants to see people mowed down and killed and i ve never said that he does not want to see that but i think what he has created in this country with his incredible rhetoric his racist rhetoric where he calls mexicans rapists and criminals where he almost condones when in in a rally when somebody was attacking somebody he said i ll pay the legal bills for violence i think he creates a climate where we are seeing a significant increase in hate crimes in this country margaret brennan mm hm senator bernie sanders hate crimes against muslims against mexicans against jews he is creating the kind of divisiveness in this nation that is the last thing that we should be doing so he creates the climate but do i think that he wants to see somebody get shot absolutely not margaret brennan do you expect that republican leadership when they come back in the fall will bring any kind of gun control legislation to the floor senator bernie sanders well margaret i certainly hope so because this is what the american people want the american people are sick and tired of powerful corporate interest determining what goes on in washington you know that s whether it s the health care industry whether it is the fossil fuel industry whether it is the nra poll after poll shows that overwhelmingly the american people want to expand margaret brennan mm hm senator bernie sanders background checks they want to do away with the gun show loophole they want to do away with the straw man provision and more and more people agree with something that i have been saying for thirty years is that assault weapons are weapons of war they are military style weapons designed to kill people margaret brennan yeah senator bernie sanders as rapidly as possible they should not be sold and distributed in this country margaret brennan senator we re going to take a quick break and continue our conversation on the other side of it so don t go away and we have a lot more to talk about announcements margaret brennan coming up in our next half hour we ll have two more democratic presidential candidates in addition to more of our conversation with bernie sanders colorado senator michael bennet and new york senator kirsten gillibrand are both in des moines iowa stay with us announcements margaret brennan we ll be right back with a lot more face the nation senators sanders gillibrand and bennet and our political panel stay with us announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we re back now with senator bernie sanders who joins us from greenfield iowa senator i want to pick up where we left off on the issue of gun control you said now you do support more efforts to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people but you have in the past been skeptical of federal gun control you voted against the brady bill in 03 and 05 you voted for a law to shield gun manufacturers and i m wondering how you explain your change of heart senator bernie sanders well i think first of all for thirty years i have been advocating for the ban on assault weapons year after year i have an f voting record from the nra i think the last one was a d minus and as president i m confident that i ll have an f minus the world has changed in thirty years and even in rural states like my state of vermont which until last year i had virtually no gun control the people of this country are sick and tired of seeing the horrific mass murders that we have been seeing year after year most recently in dayton and el paso and the american people want us to stand up to the nra the american people want strong gun control legislation i have demanded that mitch mcconnell do the right thing do what the american people want bring us back to washington right now let s pass what was passed in the house let us go further so to answer your question margaret over the last thirty years the world has changed it has changed in rural states like mine and it has changed all over this country margaret brennan how do you protect civil liberties and do things like congressman scalise advocated which is giving law enforcement more tools to root out those who might carry out these killings senator bernie sanders well it s not only giving law enforcement more tools we have got to do a lot better job than we are doing right now in fighting the rise of white nationalism in this country we need to understand that in el paso what was committed was an act of domestic violence and we need to be much more aggressive than the trump administration has in in going after those people so i am a strong civil libertarian but on the other hand i want to make sure that we do not see the rise of neo fascism in this country and that we understand that those white nationalists are in fact when they get involved in violence they are terrorists and they should be treated as terrorists margaret brennan and you support red flag laws senator bernie sanders yes i do i do margaret brennan okay all right senator thank you for joining us from the trail senator bernie sanders thank you margaret brennan we turn now to colorado senator michael bennet he joins us from the iowa state fair in des moines good morning senator it looks like a lot of fun there right behind you senator michael bennet d colorado 2020 democratic presidential candidate michaelbennet good morning it is unbelievably fun we actually just finished singing the star spangled banner everybody stopped and put their hand on their heart and sang it together margaret brennan all right well you tweeted this week that if you are elected you promise voters that they won t have to think about you for at least two weeks is it a hard strategy to try to get people to be passionate about being moderate senator michael bennet i think that people are so sick and tired of waking up in donald trump s reality tv show i think they re sick of a president who is dividing us i mean it s very clear what he is trying to do he acquired power by dividing the american people against themselves he is trying to hold onto the power by doing the same thing and every day he just tries to keep the reality tv show alive i think americans want to go on with their lives they want to build their businesses they want to raise their children they don t want to wake up you know feeling like we re on the cusp of some crazy new thing with north korea or iran or or that you know the president is tweeting out conspiracy theories about somebody who killed themselves in new york they want margaret brennan mm hm senator michael bennet a president who is actually doing their job so they can do their job confident that we leave the country in a better place for our kids and grandkids and and and confident that we ve situated america s leadership in this world again so that s what i meant by that i think that people can check in every two weeks and see how i m doing margaret brennan colorado where you re from is the state that has a lot of gun gun owners but it s also experienced horrific gun violence and they ve made some changes at the state level is that essentially what the country should be talking about because it doesn t seem that anything gets through congress right now senator michael bennet i i think that is what we should be talking about you know my oldest daughter is nineteen she was born the year after the columbine massacre happened in in my state and my state which is a western state the second amendment state we passed the background checks that are waiting for mitch mcconnell to put on the floor this summer and over that course of that almost twenty years about every year about two or three percent of the people that try to buy a gun in colorado can t buy a gun and they are murderers and they are domestic abusers and they are convicted felons of violent crimes there is nobody who could defend any of those people having a firearm if we can do it in colorado certainly we could do it nationally we have we have margaret brennan but you don t expect that to happen in september senator michael bennet put limitations margaret brennan you don t expect to vote on background check senator michael bennet well i hope that it will happen i i hope it will happen but i believe with what i believe what mike bloomberg said earlier on your show which is that the politics of this issue are changing in part because the tragedies are mounting up which is a terrible way for us to deal with it but also because the public is being galvanized by organizations like the the kids from parkland and the moms against guns and that s making a difference and if it does not come to the floor we need to make sure that every week between now and november we re making this a voting issue i m not saying just the politicians i mean all of us are making this a voting issue so that people that refused to let the american people have a vote on the floor are turned out and margaret brennan yeah senator michael bennet replaced with people who will take the vote margaret brennan you senator michael bennet i mean we re not even like mc mcconnell can vote however he wants but why doesn t he just put it on the floor so that every senator could be held accountable for their vote margaret brennan you ve been talking about ending hyper partisanship do you think it is helpful for democrats and your fellow candidates to be linking the president to these mass murders senator michael bennet well i d i i here s what i think i think donald trump is as i said has a strategy that is a to to divide the country so he can win he believes there are enough people out there he thinks it s thirty eight or thirty nine or forty percent margaret brennan yeah senator michael bennet that can keep him in office if the rest of us are not paying attention and not margaret brennan yeah senator michael bennet as strategic and i don t think we can play into that we have to unify this country that is what the people of iowa want margaret brennan right senator michael bennet the people of colorado want in south carolina and new hampshire we have to unify this country to close over a broken washington and to close over a president who is a guy who is you you know goes to our worst impulses rather than our best impulses every single day of the year we have both in our country we ve got the best impulses margaret brennan mm hm senator michael bennet with times we have our worst impulses i think we should have a president who asks us to do our best margaret brennan okay senator michael bennet and i think we have to have a president who asks us to come together margaret brennan all right senator thank you and i think i hear a child behind you so nice focus senator michael bennet there are it s margaret brennan it s a fair senator michael bennet it s not my child though so margaret brennan all right all right well good luck to the parents all right thank you senator michael bennet thank you for margaret brennan very much senator senator michael bennet thanks so much margaret brennan we ll be right back with senator michael bennet thanks margaret margaret brennan another 2020 candidate announcements margaret brennan we are back with new york senator kirsten gillibrand she joins us this morning from the campaign trail in west des moines good morning to you senator senator kirsten gillibrand d new york 2020 democratic presidential candidate sengillibrand good morning margaret brennan you support universal background checks a ban on large magazine and assault weapons and an anti gun trafficking law you need republican votes to get all those things through congress what can actually pass now senator kirsten gillibrand you know i think things are changing since kids have been marching out of their schools and marching on washington and are really demanding action you ve seen a level of advocacy that i ve never seen before and i think if mitch mcconnell would have the courage to call us back into washington to vote we would pass the universal background checks bill that s already passed the house and we would pass the bill that i wrote which is anti gun trafficking which the last time we voted on it got fifty eight votes we only needed sixty so we re only two votes shy and i believe we have the momentum and the advocacy behind us today to pass that as well margaret brennan what about red flag laws your colleague in new york chuck schumer has said they are ineffective cop outs senator kirsten gillibrand i think you can pass a red flag law but it s insufficient what we really need to do is also pass a ban on assault weapons particularly the military style weapons that have resulted in people losing their lives within seconds and then the large magazines margaret brennan many of your republican colleagues would agree on red flags being insufficient they also don t think background checks necessarily would be the argument is for more tools for law enforcement so do you support making domestic terrorism a federal crime and would you sign on to dick durbin s bill to increase resources to combat it senator kirsten gillibrand absolutely and as president i would direct my department of justice to investigate white supremacy and other domestic terrorist groups to infiltrate them to make sure we know if they re planning attacks and to absolutely combat white supremacy in society because these groups are domestic terrorists margaret brennan so when talking about white supremacy you and some of your colleagues and competitors have been linking the president s rhetoric to emboldening white supremacists you said he is emboldening white supremacists his entire presidency and his campaign are you actually saying that president trump is responsible for the killings in el paso and ohio senator kirsten gillibrand what i m saying is that his words have consequences and the words he has been using have been hateful and divisive and racist and has truly emboldened white supremacy and hate crimes across this country since president trump s been elected hate crimes have increased certainly across my state and across the country against all groups more racism more anti semitism more white supremacy more anti muslim anti immigrant anti refugees and it s changing who we are as a nation and that s one of the reasons i am running for president we need a president margaret brennan but but in terms of that senator kirsten gillibrand who will bring us back together again margaret brennan in terms of the name calling and putting it in the political context don t you think that is ratcheting up the rhetoric rather than having cooler heads prevail senator kirsten gillibrand what president trump has done is ratchet up the rhetoric when he s at a rally in florida and someone says what are you going to do with immigrants and someone shouts kill them shoot them president trump laughed so he is not leading us in the right direction he has used words like infestation he s used words like invasion that is creating a climate where people are literally today fueled by anger and hate they are hunting down other people using weapons of war that s what we re up against right now and president trump will not stand up to the nra will not stand up to the gun gun manufacturers margaret brennan well what about but but senator kirsten gillibrand to get these guns off the streets margaret brennan well what about though what joaquin castro the congressman did this week with publishing the names of some of president trump s top donors it s publicly available information but some would say he was targeting these individuals is that helpful or is that dangerous given what you re describing senator kirsten gillibrand those are his choices not mine i will call out racism when i see it i will call out white supremacy when i see it i will call out hate and i will stand up against it in every form margaret brennan i want to ask you about new york financier jeffrey epstein he is an accused child molester pedophile sex trafficker he committed suicide while in federal custody the fbi and ig are investigating do you think the u s government has failed his victims senator kirsten gillibrand well i am concerned these survivors deserved a day in court they deserved justice they deserved to speak out against this perpetrator and it is a shame that he committed suicide i do think there needs to be a full investigation about why he was taken off the terror watch excuse me why he was taken off the suicide watch list i think it s a strange decision given that he attempted suicide once already i want to know why he was left in a circumstance where suicide was even possible i think it needs a full investigation margaret brennan senator gillibrand thank you we ll be back in a moment announcements margaret brennan we are back now with our political panel jerry seib is the executive washington editor for the wall street journal and shawna thomas is the washington bureau chief for vice news out in the field this morning our cbs news political correspondent ed o keefe who is still out at the iowa state fair ed tell me you you ve been listening to all the candidates out there speak about promising some kind of gun control either now or if they re elected is there any chance any of it gets through ed o keefe cbs news political correspondent edokeefe you know margaret i have been covering this issue in one way or another for six or seven years since sandy hook essentially we go through a week of this we hit a weekend and and then it s it s struggles to sustain itself the debate and that s one of the things i am very curious to watch in the next few days is can this issue get into its second week since a big mass shooting and sustain itself there is some evidence that at least here in iowa a critical early caucus state that it might just a little while ago julian castro one of the candidates who spends a lot of time here said that this wednesday he ll be holding a forum with members of that organization that held the larger forum yesterday here in des moines to talk specifically about his gun violence plan and ways to somehow curb violence across the country it will happen in a small bedroom community that is popular with younger families young couples out in eastern iowa if that organization can continue to hold those kinds of events with candidates over the course of the next six months here and in new hampshire and in south carolina and other states maybe it does sustain itself but when that congressional debate happens in september if it happens at all i suspect it s going to look very similar to what s happened before promises of action that fall apart over the details and the concerns from either party margaret brennan mm hm ed o keefe that they may be giving away too much margaret brennan shawna our cbs news polling shows that there there is some data to back up what the candidates are saying in terms of shifting public sentiment six out of ten democrats polled by cbs say they want things like background checks majority of republicans and democrats are open to more action on this front but what s different this time is always the question shawna thomas vice news shawna i think that s a good question it is really hard not to be a little bit cynical sandy hook twenty kids died they weren t able to do all of that much afterwards i think the difference is one the nra doesn t have as much money as they used to and two there are republicans who are trying to engage in this conversation there s only so many times people can die and i do think the president saying okay let s talk about background checks now we don t know if he s going to actually follow through with that always hard to tell with this president and then hearing mcconnell say on the radio senator majority leader mitch mcconnell say on the radio okay we can maybe have this conversation when we come back at least that s happening but remember when when manchin and toomey had their bill that was a smaller bill about background checks after sandy hook there were four republicans voted for it in the senate two of those republicans are not in the senate anymore so the question is how much money does the nra raise out of this and how scared are republicans to actually have this conversation margaret brennan and we didn t hear from congressman scalise who is the whip really any promise of anything that would be voted for he seemed to say there are a lot of tools already there that just need to be used better by law enforcement gerald seib the wall street journal geraldfseib yeah so i think the question is very much open will attention stay on this issue as it suggested or is that the circus move on to the next town one of the things that might be different to your point is that for years and years the passion on the gun issue was on the pro gun side not the people who favored gun control people who wanted guns or more passionate about that issue than the other side that might have switched in 2018 i think we ll find out now for sure whether that s the case or not but this is not really a complicated equation this comes down to two men this comes down to president trump and to mitch mcconnell the republican leader in the senate he says he will not bring up a bill on the senate that the president won t sign so will the president convince people he wants a background bill that he will sign that s the only question that really matters in a sense shawna thomas sorry margaret brennan sorry ed i wanted to ask you one of the things that is different is this overlay of racial politics as well the fact that the killer in el paso said he specifically went to target mexicans and that this was the largest attack on the latino community this country has ever seen does that overlay the hate crime change things ed o keefe i think it does to some extent especially because it happened in such a border community that s defined by its latino heritage you know and and the fact frankly that one of the presidential candidates is from there beto o rourke he was able to help draw even more attention to this perhaps than it would have gotten otherwise there has been a lot of debate in the past week about you know is this just a gun debate or is this does this also have to be a conversation about the fact that this was the largest anti latino attack essentially in modern history and i have talked to some colleagues and i asked julian castro the other day when he was here whether or not he thought the nation s response have been proper he thought to some extent it had but i got a sense from him that perhaps it could have been a little stronger or there could have been more conversation about that but i think it it absolutely helps fuel the conversation because race is will be and and and probably should continue to be part of the conversation in this campaign margaret brennan mm hm ed o keefe given the fact that you have so many historic candidates running given that the democratic party continues to have this debate over where exactly it should be campaigning for votes in order to win back the white house do you focus on southern states with younger and more minority populations do you come back to here in the midwest and and try to drive up the numbers among margaret brennan mm hm ed o keefe white working class voters although if you were to come to iowa you would find a growing percentage of latino people here so it s an argument that has a double relevance certainly over the past week and candidates knew that margaret brennan shawna joe biden had a few missteps this week steve scalise in this interview on our show hit him on a few of those things but one of them was also he he seemed to say something to the effect of poor kids are just as good as white kids the the right jumped on him for that shawna thomas yeah and you know here s the deal joe biden is an older person and sometimes he is going to he is going to say things that sound like mistakes that is something that he and his campaign are going to have to deal with because in the world we currently live in with you know social media twenty four hour cable news everything else every little thing you do is going to be under a microscope and republicans are going to jump on him for that i think it is clear what he was trying to say i don t think he was trying to in any way in this type of commentary be racist or or anything like that but this is a problem they are going to have to continue to deal with and it s going to happen in debates he this he s just going to have to figure out how to speak a little bit more carefully margaret brennan jerry when you look at what happened this week gerald seib hm margaret brennan and the escalation of the trade war there are some republicans who are nervous that the president is hurting his chances at reelection if his bet does not pay off gerald seib well it s an interesting situation because this is actually an issue the trade fight with china in particular where the president has some bipartisan support you know chuck schumer s warning to the president a few months ago was don t go soft on china so up to this point he s got a lot of republican support a fair amount of business community support and some democratic support but a lot of that support is basically premised on the idea that the trade wars will be temporary and that they ll be contained and this is the week where i think it started to look as if wait this might get out of control and it might go on for a long time and i think some people who are with the president now on trade didn t sign up for a long trade war they signed up for a short tariff fight and if that s not what it is i think it becomes very problematic for the president or at least potentially so shawna thomas and those farmers in iowa want to know gerald seib yeah shawna thomas what the future holds for them i mean we ve talked to a lot of farmers in iowa in vice news who are basically saying okay i i am willing to go with the president because i do think we need to stand up to china but if i don t have some consistency soon i don t know how to make decisions about my business and i m going to lose money and that s scary gerald seib and it s interesting that if you look at the numbers the trade deficit actually went up in the first six months of this year it s bigger now margaret brennan mm hm gerald seib it s eight percent bigger than it was a year ago so you have to ask the question is this working is this trade war working it was supposed to bring the trade deficit down so i think it s a very tricky time we we may be at a bit of an inflection point for president trump on the trade issue margaret brennan it s something we ll watch thanks to all of you and that thanks to ed out in iowa we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan that s it for us today thank you all for watching
