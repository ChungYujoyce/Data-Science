supporting mrs clinton intends to reach out to republican megadonors disillusioned by their party s presumptive nominee more broadly mrs clinton s campaign is repositioning itself after a year of emphasizing liberal positions and focusing largely on minority voters to also appeal to independent and republican leaning white voters turned off by mr trump with the democratic nomination in sight mrs clinton has broadened her economic message devoted days to apologizing for a comment she previously made that angered working class whites and pledged that her husband former president bill clinton who remains widely popular among the blue collar voters drawn to mr trump would come out of retirement and be in charge of creating jobs in places that have been particularly hard hit according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president the effort is a striking turn after she spent the past year trying to mobilize the liberal wing and labor leaders in the democratic party but her campaign confident that the young people and liberals backing senator bernie sanders of vermont will come around to support mrs clinton in november is focusing its efforts on white working class women and suburban women who tend to vote for republican presidential candidates but who polls show hold negative views of mr trump i m here because i want you to know whether people vote for me or not whether they yell at me or not it s not going to affect what i will do to help mrs clinton told residents at a health clinic here on monday as protesters chants outside of hillary go home could be heard the campaign expects to assemble a republicans for hillary group and mrs clinton has from her

republican who described her as a superb representative of the united states all over the world in the past mrs clinton has praised david h petraeus former director of the c i a who is a republican in february he said that mrs clinton would be a tremendous president mrs clinton s two day swing across appalachia this week served as the beginning of the campaign s full court press to convince persuadable white voters that she would run a more inclusive campaign than mr trump and to signal that she would cede no demographic group to him i invite a lot of republicans and independents who i ve been seeing on the campaign trail who ve been reaching out to me i invite them to join with democrats mrs clinton told cnn on wednesday let s get off the red or the blue team let s get on the american team in the democratic primary mrs clinton has struggled with non college educated white voters and self identified independents often losing those groups by wide margins to mr sanders but faced with the choice between mrs clinton and mr trump 51 percent of independents and 59 percent of moderates favor the former secretary of state compared with 41 percent and 39 percent for mr trump according to the most recent cnn orc poll if the primary happened to be over already we feel the coalition we ve built has the makings of a winning coalition as it is in a general election said brian fallon a clinton spokesman but he added we re not satisfied with that we want to make inroads even with populations that aren t supporting her in great numbers senator sherrod brown democrat of ohio who is supporting mrs clinton said while campaigning with her at a diner in athens ohio on tuesday that the suburban women in cleveland columbus and cincinnati could ultimately decide the november election i think educated suburban white women to be sure are going to be turned off en masse and there will be more of that he said referring to their opinion of mr trump on friday president obama helped in mrs clinton s effort republican women voters are going to have to decide is that the guy i feel comfortable with representing me and what i care about he said of mr trump at a news conference transcript tktktktkttk but if mrs clinton s breaking down barriers tour in kentucky ohio and west virginia this week provided a road map for her campaign s strategy in the weeks ahead the antagonistic reception she received also highlighted her own vulnerabilities and tendency to divide people weaknesses mr trump plans to exploit at mrs clinton s event in athens a protester peter schmidt 34 and a miller held a handmade sign that read i d rather be home reading your goldman sachs transcripts a reference to the paid speeches she delivered to the wall street bank mr schmidt said her tour of appalachia felt like pandering i don t trust her he said that s why i m holding this sign mr trump who has proved adept in connecting with white working class men also plans to hit mrs clinton on her previous support for global trade deals that many americans blame for jobs moving overseas he has giddily seized on a comment she made to cnn in march that we re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business the backlash over that remark made in the context of replacing coal with clean energy jobs turned mrs clinton s campaign events into an appalachian apology tour as she was repeatedly and pointedly forced to explain what she called a misstatement i can t take it back mrs clinton told one out of work coal industry worker bo copley 39 a father of three and a registered republican when he emotionally confronted her about the comment what i want you to know is i m going to do everything i can to help no matter what happens politically she added that is just how i am made the clinton campaign is also moving to exploit the public criticism of mr trump by prominent republicans on wednesday the campaign released an online ad that quotes mr trump s former primary opponents describing him as a know nothing candidate a narcissist and the most vulgar person ever to aspire to the presidency among other epithets mrs clinton has portrayed mr trump as a loose cannon on foreign policy and often points to her husband s record as evidence that she would help blue collar voters the brilliance of bill clinton gives her a particular edge said gaston caperton a democratic former governor of west virginia who supports mrs clinton even with mr clinton in its corner the clinton campaign does not expect to win voters like mr copley who said he is undecided but who generally fits mr trump s core demographic of supporters but mrs clinton hopes to make inroads with women like mr copley s wife lauren voters whom clinton aides call megachurch moms and describe as religious republican leaning women who reject mr trump christine matthews a researcher who advises republicans on how to win female voters said that portraying mr trump as dangerous on foreign policy could help mrs clinton draw some republican women whose most important issues are national security and terrorism can she drive moms who have kids who think oh my gosh this is too scary a prospect and our country won t be safe if he s elected president ms matthews said you can imagine that attack ad in your head democrats acknowledge that the prospect of terrifying skeptical voters into supporting their candidate would not be the most inspirational campaign message it is a far bleaker appeal than ronald reagan s message of american exceptionalism and mr clinton s promise to restore the forgotten middle class both of which inspired white working class voters to cross party lines but mrs clinton s pitch to republicans reflects the grim political realities of 2016 more than half of the registered voters who said they would vote for mrs clinton planned to do so in opposition to mr trump rather than in support of her candidacy according to the cnn orc poll her bumper sticker for republicans should be unified against trump or vote for the enemy it s important said ben howe a republican and a contributing editor at the conservative online publication red state who posted the clinton campaign s imwithher slogan on twitter after mr trump s decisive victory in indiana or as jan franck 65 a retiree in charleston w va put it after hearing mrs clinton speak on tuesday she could be a sock puppet running against donald trump and i d vote for her advertisement
