watch cbsn live updated on april 21 2020 8 35 pm cbs ap the world is awash in oil as demand drops from businesses and consumers alike amid the coronavirus pandemic we re also running out of places to store it that in a nutshell explains monday s strange and unprecedented action in the market for crude oil futures contracts where traders essentially offered to pay someone else to deal with the oil they were due to have delivered next month the price of u s benchmark crude that would be delivered in may was selling for around 15 a barrel monday morning but fell as low as 40 per barrel during the day it was the first time that the price on a futures contract for oil has gone negative analysts say it s the worst oil price in history which shouldn t surprise us because it s the inevitable result of the biggest supply and demand disparity in history said ryan sitton commissioner at the texas railroad commission which regulates the state s oil industry there s little mystery as to why there s so little demand for oil efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus have major cities around the world on lockdown air travel has been seriously curtailed and millions of people are working from home leading to far fewer commuters on the roads the jaw dropping oil price collapse may not be over cautioned edward moya senior market analyst at oanda in a tuesday research note to clients today traders are saying that they are not waiting till the next expiry to make oil prices crumble again but pumps are still running extracting oil from the ground and all that oil has to go somewhere here are some questions and answers about the latest developments in the oil patch sometimes the price on the future delivery of oil will get skewed by a surprise event say an oil pipeline bursts that can cause the price of a futures contract for a given month to be sharply higher or lower than that of the futures contract for the next month usually this is smoothed out by the market but the sharp pullback in demand combined with a glut of oil has led to a dearth of oil storage capacity that made it hard for traders with contracts for crude delivery in may to find buyers which sent the contract price into negative territory this has never happened before not even close said tim bray senior portfolio manager at guidestone capital management in dallas we ve never seen a negative price on a futures contract for oil cheap oil leads to cheaper prices at the pump which are often viewed as a boon for consumers the average price in the u s for a gallon of regular gasoline fell to about 1 49 or less more than 1 less than a year ago according to aaa but this time around it s not good for anybody said jim burkhard vice president at ihs markit typically when oil prices fall gasoline prices fall and that benefits consumers burkhard said but prices are falling today because hardly anyone driving they re driving a lot lot less so it s difficult for anyone to take advantage of these lower gasoline prices if they re not driving so there s no winner in this situation today the crash in oil prices is weighing on the stock market with dow jones industrial average futures pointing to a decline of more than 2 on tuesday morning the plunge in the oil market is heightening concerns about the lasting impact of the pandemic with oil industry stalwarts such as exxon and chevron likely to trade lower on tuesday u s equities are poised for a lower open on lingering concerns that the historic oil plunge will cripple a key part of the economy and as earnings season continues to see further cautious comments across the board oanda s moya noted while some companies may be paying others to take away their crude oil that does not appear to be widespread many analysts described the dip in crude oil prices as technical related to the way futures contracts are written most buyers are currently purchasing oil that would be delivered in june not may even so there were more than 150 000 of those futures contracts that traded hands enough volume to make it meaningful said ryan fitzmaurice energy strategist at rabobank in my view today s move was more technical in nature and related to the futures contract expiration fitzmaurice said we could see isolated incidents where oil companies pay people to take their oil away as storage and pipeline capacity become scarce but that is unlikely on a sustained basis with far less gasoline and jet fuel being consumed oil tanks are starting to fill up experts have been warning that global storage could fill up in late april or early may that s led some producers to decide to move oil now because the space may become more valuable than the oil sitton said there s so much oversupply and storage is fulling up sitton said eventually you go to a point where literally there s so much of a valuable commodity in the world that the commodity no longer has value and that s what we re seeing with many oil tanks filling up the federal government is negotiating with companies to store crude oil in the strategic petroleum reserve but if all the storage tanks are full oil companies will begin shutting in wells which can damage oil fields many tankers are full of oil and floating at sea earlier this month opec and its allies with political pressure from the u s government agreed to cut production by nearly 10 million barrels per day about 10 of current global output but some analysts feel the deal didn t go far enough to curb massive oversupply it kept prices from falling farther for the time being but there s still too much oil in the world first published on april 21 2020 8 55 am 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed the associated press
