biden he told us that he was confident about his prospects in south carolina and beyond begin vt margaret brennan our latest battleground tracker polling shows your lead with south carolina black voters is thinning out in november you were at fifty four percent support it s now thirty five percent that s a nineteen point difference joe biden former vice president joebiden democratic presidential candidate joebiden it s also been about margaret brennan what is happening joe biden what s happening is you have steyer spending hundreds of millions tens of thousands of dollars millions of dollars out campaigning there and so i think a lot s happening in terms of the amount of money being spent by the billionaires to try to cut into the african american vote i think that has a lot to do with it margaret brennan south carolina though is your firewall joe biden you said it my firewall margaret brennan you need joe biden i ve never said it margaret brennan the campaign has said it s your joe biden no margaret brennan firewall joe biden it s not fi i said i m going to do well there and i ll do well there and i ll do well beyond there as well margaret brennan what does do well mean for you joe biden look you guys can do all the pontificating about what it means i m not going to that s not my job my job is to go in and make the best case i can and i think we re going to do well i think we re going to go on to super tuesday and do very well margaret brennan your campaign manager had said second place there d be a sigh of relief in south carolina you disagree with your campaign manager joe biden look i am not going to do the pontificating about you know i m not a pundit margaret brennan mm hm joe biden i m a candidate and i just i m going to tell you i m going to go all the way through this thing margaret brennan you mentioned on spending steyer you think the amount of money he is spending in south carolina joe biden a lot of money margaret brennan is is trimming away at your support joe biden well i i assume that s part of the reason why those numbers are down but i don t know margaret brennan mm hm what do you think is happening joe biden we ll see i mean look you guys love this stuff i m not into this let s just see what happens margaret brennan you re watching all of this joe biden i m not watching this at all i go out i m running for the same exact reason when i started to restore some dignity to the office to make sure that african americans and minorities get treated well and this time when we rebuild the middle class get brought along and to unify the country and the party nothing s changed why i m running i m going to continue to do that margaret brennan why does joe biden want to be president what is the the key thing that s driving you that you want to achieve if you re elected joe biden we have to restore the integrity of this country internationally we have to get off of this god awful effort on this president s part to divide the country we have to bring the middle class back we have to have a health care policy that makes sense that is doable which i can do by and by building on obamacare and we have to have an immigration policy that in fact is rational and reasonable and represents who we are they are all the reasons why i m running among others but look the next president of the united states also is going to have to stand on the stage on day one and lead the world they are going to have to be able to know what they are doing internationally and the other leaders are going to have to know who that person is and know that person knows them and i m the best qualified person by a long shot of anybody running to do that that s why i m running margaret brennan bernie sanders can you stop him in terms of the momentum he has the bloomberg campaign as you know is out saying that for moderates like yourselves he is going to basically end up with an insurmountable delegate lead because of his early success joe biden i told you i m not going to play this game with you i don t know it s not about who i stop it s why i m running why i m telling the people that i should be the next president and why i m the best guy to beat trump all those other polls you all cite also show i m the most person i m the person most likely to beat trump i m the person that in fact in in those polls in addition to that i m the only one in terms of the russians and all these stuff you ve all been reporting the the russians don t want me to be the nominee they spent a lot of money on bots on facebook and they ve been taken down saying biden is a bad guy they don t want biden running they are not no one is helping me to try to get the nomination they have good reason margaret brennan who informed you of that was it facebook or have u s intelligence officials told you about some kind of meddling with the campaign joe biden i have not spoken to the intelligence community but i think the intelligence community should inform the rest of us who are running what they told senator sanders margaret brennan and there s no date for that to happen joe biden not that i m aware of margaret brennan but you re asking for it joe biden i think they should margaret brennan you should from what you are seeing you talked about facebook and them alerting you is that am i understanding you correctly joe biden well i i was told that that the there are a lot of bots on facebook and they ve been all taken down and so there were margaret brennan fake accounts being run by the russians joe biden attacks on me fake accounts yes and they were taken down but i i don t know who i i didn t get a call from facebook but i i m i was told by my my staff that s what happened margaret brennan because i know you have been critical of senator sanders for not being strong enough in his condemnation of some of the vitriolic sentiment online and senator sanders has come out with a statement saying and he said it on the debate stage as well that perhaps some of this may be fueled by the russians in other words joe biden well margaret brennan they are not actually his supporters do you buy that joe biden well look the people who occupy my office maybe they were russians i don t know but they they said they were bernie supporters the people who occupied other offices and the people who did these terrible things to the culinary workers and the women who run that operation i i guess anything is possible but they are identified as bernie supporters so i i m not making any comment beyond that but there should be absolute condemnation of the conduct of these folks who are engaging in that kind of behavior and the misogynistic behavior against the culinary workers and people coming into my office the police had to this was back in in in you know the first two primaries and have to call the police to get them out of our office i mean that that s trump like stuff i mean this is not the stuff that we ve done in democratic primaries before margaret brennan when he says the ugly stuff may be because of the russians sounds like you re saying no joe biden i don t know i ll let you make that judgment margaret brennan well all of us would like to know a little bit more about exactly what s happening but u s intelligence hasn t made any of this public yet white house isn t shedding much light but the bottom line seems to be that joe biden the white house is shedding light the president is angry because the intelligence community in fact informed bernie sanders and i guess others and members of the intelligence committee that in fact the russians want to see trump reelected and they like bernie margaret brennan we spoke to the national security adviser to the president who is denying that the white house was informed of the preference for trump but but you and i both know that in 2016 that was the intelligence community s clear joe biden all i know is margaret brennan assessment joe biden what i have read and has been reported no one has confided in me i have no inside information margaret brennan but the bottom line is doesn t all of this shake the confidence of the american people to a certain extent in the in terms of the integrity of the election itself i mean this is joe biden that s margaret brennan right at the heart of american democracy joe biden i ve been saying this for over three years the president denies they are involved they ve been involved i was deeply involved in the intelligence apparatus and how it functioned before we left the vice presidency it was clear they were involved the president continues to deny their involvement it s overwhelming and the fact is that everybody knows except but when the president stands before the whole world looks at vladimir putin says why would he want to interfere in our elections well seventeen intelligence agencies told me told them he did so this is all this is bizarre this is bizarre this is continuing and what s happened why in god s name haven t we hardened the electoral process provided billions hundreds of millions of dollars to the states to be able to harden their voter rolls make sure they can t be attacked by cyber security as a consequence of cyber attacks why haven t we provided the capacity for them to be able to have the money to have paper ballots in addition to that i mean this is this is outrageous and it s going on look i joined with the leaders of europe when the european elections took place back before i got involved i d be before i before i decided to run and we set up an organization that in fact said every european leader running in in either party in any party would take a pledge margaret brennan mm hm joe biden that if you got any negative information about someone else from another from a foreign source you would not use it and if you got any information that they were trying to interfere you d report it i took margaret brennan have you asked your democratic colleagues joe biden that pledge margaret brennan to do that joe biden well i have said that on on stage i i you know i think we all should take that pledge i ve taken the pledge margaret brennan you were in office obviously in 2016 joe biden yep margaret brennan when all of this interference was first detected joe biden yes margaret brennan since that time a bipartisan senate intelligence committee finding faulted the obama administration for its response and said that the actions taken undermined public confidence in the election and allowed for further russian interference do you agree with these findings joe biden not at all margaret brennan that the administration fell short joe biden not at all look we went out and went to the committee went to the republican leadership and said look this is what we have i didn t but the intelligence community did this is what we have why don t you join us in condemning what s happening and the republican leader of senate said no i want no part of it joining in what is happening and everything that came up subsequently to that reinforced what we were saying was going on now the question was should the president have come along and said by the way this is happening and then it be viewed and accused of we were somehow margaret brennan right joe biden we alone were doing something margaret brennan but in hindsight you know where this story ends up joe biden well i margaret brennan do you joe biden but we didn t have the margaret brennan do you think there are lessons for the current administration to learn joe biden look this administration is incapable of learning in elections they like this come on let s be fair here they ve known this for a long time for three years every intelligence agency has told them they continue to be engaged in this activity every intelligence agency told me they were engaged before there is not any question anymore there s never been a question for the last three years and what s he doing zero what is the republican leadership in the united states senate and congress doing zero end vt margaret brennan we ll have more of our interview with the former vice president in our next half hour and we ll be back in one minute with national security adviser robert o brien announcements president donald trump they re trying to start a rumor it s disinformation that s the only thing they re good at that putin wants to make sure i get elected listen to this so doesn t he want to see who the democrat s going to be wouldn t he rather have let s say bernie wouldn t he rather have bernie who honeymooned in moscow margaret brennan that s the president at a friday rally in las vegas claiming that reports of russia interfering in his favor was democratic disinformation when we were in las vegas saturday i spoke with the white house national security adviser robert o brien who was in our washington studio i asked him if he had assured the president that this particular u s intelligence finding was real he strongly disputed it robert o brien national security adviser well i have not seen the finding i think what he is referring to and what folks are talking about is a briefing that took place last week at the house intelligence committee that was leaked to the press and i i have not seen that report i get this second hand but from republican congressmen that were in the committee there was no intelligence behind it i haven t seen any intelligence to support the reports that were leaked out of the house margaret brennan but the white house was briefed on february 14th were you not in that briefing when the president was informed robert o brien well there s no briefing that i have received that the president has received that says that president putin is doing anything to try and influence the elections in favor of president trump we just haven t seen that intelligence if it s out there i haven t seen it i d be surprised if i haven t seen it the leaders of our the ic have not seen it so i again i don t know where this is coming from i ve heard these rumors and these leaks from adam schiff s committee but i i have not seen them myself and i ve seen no intelligence along those lines margaret brennan but just to clarify are you saying that joseph maguire the former acting director of national intelligence did not inform you about the u s intelligence committee s community s findings robert o brien no i look i think you know and again i i don t want to get into private conversations in a in a presidential daily brief but i i don t think admiral maguire was necessarily informed of what was going to happen at that hearing in the house either and and again there s nothing that he s given up no information admiral maguire gave us gina haspel has given us director haspel ambassador grenell the new acting dni that comports with what was leaked out of that house intel committee so i haven t seen it the leaders of the of the intelligence community that i have spoken with haven t seen anything that comports with what was leaked out but again those leaks i don t know if that s what the briefers told the house committee i mean those were just simply leaked margaret brennan but well that that s contradicted by reports that the director of national intelligence maguire did brief white house officials but more broadly the fbi director at the beginning of the month chris wray testified that russia continues to try to influence the elections mainly through social media manipulation so this pattern of behavior has continued russia is undeterred are you denying that that is happening robert o brien no no what i look i what i have heard from the fbi you know well what i ve heard is that russia would like bernie sanders to to win the democrat nomination they d probably like him to be president understandably because he wants to to spend money on social programs and probably would have to take it out of the military so that would make sense and and look the russians have always tried to interfere with elections because they want to divide americans they want to undermine our democracy but the idea that they want to they want to influence the election and somehow cause the president to win i just don t see it but look i think there are a number of countries china russia north korea iran that would like to influence our elections to to get the candidate that they feel would be best for their country margaret brennan so you are saying that it is not in fact the u s intelligence community s assessment that russia has a preference for president trump robert o brien i i have not seen that and and again why would they have a preference for president trump who is rebuilding our military who is giving the ukrainians lethal aid to fight russian troops so that doesn t make sense now look we want good relations with russia we d like to have great relations with russia i haven t seen any intelligence that there s any active measures by the russians to try and get the president re elected and and we ve got a simple message for the russians or any other country that wants to to meddle in our elections whoever they are behind stay out of our democratic elections and and we re doing everything we can we re working with state and local officials we re going in many cases margaret brennan but you robert o brien to paper ballots to make sure that that you know governments with ill intent can t hack secretary of state websites can t get involved in our elections change results and and we re going to work on election security very very hard through across the interagency in the federal government and also with our state and and local partners margaret brennan why not have the intelligence community testify in public about what they are seeing so that the public can arm themselves so that they can understand what is disinformation and what is fact robert o brien look i margaret brennan why not declassify some of those robert o brien i d i d have no problem with that and and but that s not my decision and the intelligence community is is very concerned and and careful about sources and methods and i understand that but i i would personally have no problem with margaret brennan but back in 20 back in 2016 in october of 2016 when russia was doing this disinformation campaign the obama administration did declassify information at that time so there is a precedent why doesn t the trump administration do that robert o brien i think if there s intelligence that we can declassify that that we can get out there all the better because again we weren t in office in 2016 when when the last election meddling took place and the administration did very little about it and and they you know everyone admits that that very little was done about it we re in office now and we re doing everything we can across the interagency and with our state and federal and local partners to to ensure that that american ballots are secure that that are our our ballot machines are secure that tabulations are secure that that state secretary of state websites are secure we want to make sure that this is a free and fair election that americans select their next president not some foreign country and and we re going to do and the president s been deadly serious about that margaret brennan i i want to quickly ask you though about afghanistan if the taliban does not make good on its promise to pull back on violence to sign this deal at the end of the month is the president positioned to stop the troop withdrawal robert o brien the president made it very clear the last time we were closed to signing a deal with the taliban and they they engaged in some malign activity they they had a vehicle borne ied that killed a number of people including one american and the president pulled back from signing the deal we re hopeful that that we can get to a a place where the afghans can talk with each other and negotiate some sort of resolution a political resolution of the conflict we ve been there nineteen years it s time for us to stop bringing our our sons and daughters home through dover air force base and dignified transfers we ve got to get out of of the war in afghanistan but we re going to do it in a way that protects american interests so if the taliban does not live up to their agreement on the reduction of violence plan then we ll take a very care careful look at them i think it d be unlikely that we d we d sign a peace treaty but we re not going to reduce troops to a level below what is necessary to protect american interests and our partners in afghanistan i can assure you of that margaret brennan all right ambassador o brien thank you for joining us robert o brien always great to be here margaret margaret brennan the trump appointed official overseeing u s election security shelby pierson reported to congress that russia was interfering in the election and has shown a preference for president trump but sources tell our major garrett there was bipartisan push back on her assertions and questions about the strength of the evidence congress has requested to see the underlying intelligence to back up that assessment which as you heard the national security advisor said he had not seen cbs stands by major s reporting that the president was told russia was trying to help him win we ll be back in a moment announcements margaret brennan 60 minutes correspondent anderson cooper sat down with senator bernie sanders for tonight s broadcast here s a preview begin vt anderson cooper 60 minutes just on foreign policy you said you believe in diplomacy you re concerned donald trump is is going to get us into an unnecessary war are there situations where you believe military action is senator bernie sanders 60 minutes no absolutely no of course i don t you know hopefully it s it s rare as possible but anderson cooper yeah senator bernie sanders we have the best military in the world anderson cooper what would your criteria be for military action do you senator bernie sanders well threats against the american people to be sure threats against our allies i believe in nato i believe that the united states everything being equal should be working with other countries in alliance not doing it alone anderson cooper if china took military action against taiwan is that something you would senator bernie sanders that s something i mean i think we have got to make it clear to countries around the world that we will not sit by and allow invasions to take place absolutely anderson cooper would you meet with kim jong un senator bernie sanders yeah i mean i have criticized trump for everything under the world under the sun but meeting with people who are antagonistic is is to me not a bad thing to do i think unfortunately trump went into that meeting unprepared i think it was a photo opportunity and did not have the kind of the diplomatic work necessary to make it a success but i do not have a problem with sitting down with adversaries all over the world end vt margaret brennan and national security is just one of the many topics we ll be asking the candidates about in our cbs news south carolina democratic debate on tuesday in charleston be sure to join us at 8 00 pm tuesday on the cbs network and cbsn announcements margaret brennan we ll be right back with more politics and more of our interview with former vice president joe biden plus our panel so stay with us announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation as the democratic race moves on to south carolina that primary will be held next saturday we have a cbs news battleground tracker out this morning and it shows former vice president joe biden on top of the field there with twenty eight percent support of likely democratic primary voters he is leading but that s a seventeen point drop since our last south carolina poll in november vermont senator bernie sanders is not far behind with twenty three percent support billionaire tom steyer who has flooded the local airwaves with ads is at eighteen massachusetts senator elizabeth warren is next with twelve percent followed by former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg at ten and minnesota senator amy klobuchar is at four percent former new york mayor michael bloomberg is not on the ballot anthony salvanto here to explain all these numbers what more can you tell us about how the primary is shaping up anthony salvanto so underneath that shrinking lead for joe biden you just described there s two big things one is while he s still on top with african american voters who will make up most of the democrats in this primary that lead is so much smaller now and he s got to share a lot of that support now with bernie sanders and with tom steyer also when you look at who black voters think understands their concerns well that s still joe biden but it s also increasingly bernie sanders they say and also tom steyer the other part of this is frankly not winning this is the mechanics of momentum that all the pundits talk about voters in south carolina say they think it s less likely that joe biden will ultimately win the democratic nomination so that makes them start to look at other candidates and think okay what is it that those other voters in those other states know that we should maybe reassess margaret brennan that s south carolina let s look at what s happening nationwide right now bernie sanders is on top with twenty eight percent support of likely democratic primary voters elizabeth warren comes in behind him with nineteen percent followed by former vice president biden at seventeen former new york city mayor michael bloomberg is sitting out the first four contests of course he comes in at thirteen percent support thought pete buttigieg is next with ten percent amy klobuchar has five tom steyer has two so nationwide bernie sanders is still beating out joe biden anthony salvanto yeah he is and he wasn t always but this was even done before last night s big win for sanders in nevada so a couple of things happened here one is the electability argument voters look at what s happening in these states and say who do they think can put together a coalition that can win we see that while joe biden is still widely seen as having a chance to beat president trump bernie sanders also is and quite frankly when democrats and others look at a match up against president trump across the whole electorate well it s tight for all of these democrats for joe biden for bernie sanders narrow leads at best over the president really within the margin of error across all voters margaret brennan but the candidates get a chance to throw some elbows and distinguish themselves on the debate stage on tuesday that will be right here on cbs who succeeds in that arena anthony salvanto well debates matter and voters in this poll have told us that debates matter one example right there is elizabeth warren who s still doing okay nationally people told us that they thought her debate performance last time was most impressive and that could be helping bolster her at least national support and you also look at by comparison joe biden s debate ranking was lower than that so there s a lot of pressure on these candidates heading into that tuesday debate margaret brennan all right anthony salvanto thank you very much and now we turn to our political correspondent ed o keefe who is out in las vegas getting ready to head to south carolina ed good morning to you what does joe biden need to do to challenge sanders front runner status ed o keefe cbs news political correspondent edokeefe he needs to win south carolina bottom line he will spend the whole week in the palmetto state trying to make the argument that he is best positioned to defeat president trump that he can build the multiracial multigenerational coalition to do it but the numbers here in nevada prove he is going to struggle with that he had an interesting line last night that we re going to hear a lot more of aides tell me he said i m not a socialist i m not a plutocrat i am a democrat trying to make the argument that he best represents what the party wants to do in defeating president trump margaret brennan well we know michael bloomberg is still not on the ballot but he is going to be in south carolina on the debate stage tuesday how does he need to prepare for that ed o keefe well his aides say that they will continue to try to keep the focus on sanders and make the argument that it would be dangerous for democrats to nominate him because he wouldn t necessarily be able to attract the kind of independent and potentially disgruntled republican voters that the democrats will need in order to win back the white house but he is going to continue to face questions about his business practices and his decision to release at least three employees from their nondisclosure agreements elizabeth warren especially continues to hammer away at him and it appears to be working at least from a financial sense she s been able to raise a lot of money since that debate when she attacked him and there s evidence from the results in nevada that her debate performance there may have helped her remember in the next few days most of these candidates will be campaigning not just in south carolina but in the fourteen other states voting on super tuesday texas north carolina north dakota arkansas colorado they won t all be in south carolina this week because they know there are huge prizes to be won on march 3rd just three days after south carolina margaret brennan all right ed o keefe on the ground in las vegas and we will be seeing you in south carolina soon ed thank you we ll be right back with more from our interview with former vice president joe biden announcements margaret brennan we are back with more of our interview with former vice president joe biden begin vt margaret brennan afghanistan joe biden democratic presidential candidate joebiden yes margaret brennan there is a plan in place for a deal to be signed at the end of the month after this pause in violence or reduction in violence i remember when the obama administration sought a deal with the taliban trump administration is now on the verge of signing one joe biden which we know nothing about look i opposed the surge in the first place number one i didn t think we should have even the troops we sent there now it s all been made public now that we should have the troops in the first place that we sent there and i didn t think we should have had the number of troops which is considerably less than the present this this president added margaret brennan mm hm joe biden i think we should only have troops there to make sure that it s impossible for the taliban and excuse me for isis or al qaeda to reestablish a foothold there to be able to go from afghanistan to the united states to attack the united states that requires a much smaller footprint but as i understand it we re not drawing down to a level that was even as low as it was when we left afghanistan margaret brennan about eighty six hundred is the number of troops joe biden yeah and so we ll see i mean it s a little premature to make the judgment whether or not this is a good deal or not a good deal margaret brennan but as you just said in the course of your answer there you do think there should be some u s presence that remains in afghanistan joe biden yes a very small presence to be able to determine whether or not i mean a small footprint margaret brennan what does that look like for american joe biden look well it looks like se several thousand people margaret brennan mm hm joe biden to make sure that we have a place from which we can operate if in fact you find that there s a re amassing of taliban capacity excuse me of al qaeda and or isis capacity to strike the united states like happened in 9 11 margaret brennan the washington post quoted you this week in a story about afghanistan saying that back in 2010 you said to richard holbrooke the then envoy i m not sending my boy back there to risk his life on behalf of women s rights it just won t work not what we re there for is that how you remember it joe biden yeah margaret brennan or what did you mean joe biden what i meant was there is a thousand places we can go to deal with injustice i can think of ten countries where women and or children and or people are being are being persecuted or being hurt but the idea of us going to be able to use our armed forces to solve every single internal problem that exists throughout the world is not within our capacity the question is is america s vital self interest at stake or the vital self interest of one of our allies at stake and the fact that they have a system in afghanistan as they do in parts of pakistan as they do in parts of other countries that we re going to send troops to because there is not a a human rights are not being valued to the same degree that we are that s a different story about sending combat troops we should call it out we should go to the united nations we should be saying this is what s happening we should try to shame and get the world to put pressure on an economic pressure on people who engage countries who engage in that but not send troops that s what i meant it is not sufficient that was my point and the idea was and i think richard had said something like well women are being abused there i said they are being abused in a lot of places around the world are we going to send our american forces all over the world to make sure that stops margaret brennan but then don t you bear some responsibility for the outcome if the taliban ends up back in control and women end up losing the rights joe biden no i don t look are you telling me that we should go into china because go to war with china because what they are doing to the uyghurs a million uyghurs in the out in the west in concentration camps is that what you re saying to me margaret brennan it was your quote sir i was asking you what you meant joe biden no i know i gave you my i gave the answer do i bear responsibility zero responsibility margaret brennan mm hm joe biden the responsibility i have is to protect america s nat national self interest and not put our women and men in harm s way to try to solve every single problem in the world by use of force that s my responsibility as president and that s what i ll do as president end vt margaret brennan we ll be right back with our political panel announcements margaret brennan it s time now for some political analysis from our panel susan page is the washington bureau chief

margaret brennan which is that our election process actually works and undermining faith in the integrity of the election is a massive risk i think everyone can agree on that what we have heard in the past few days i think is frankly confusing and national security adviser robert o brien said not just that he had not seen the underlying intelligence that russia was intervening with a preference for trump but also that he had never received a briefing to that effect he also told us told us in our interview that the fbi did tell him that russia was interviewing intervening to help sanders this morning trump says he was never told that what should americans at home understand from this because bottom line isn t the national security adviser s job to say our elections will be protected no matter who is interfering and no matter whom they are interfering on behalf of lanhee chen yeah look i i think he said that at the end i think he made the point that regardless of who is doing this or what they might be trying to do it is the job of this administration to protect the integrity of the election process and the integrity of our democratic process but you know i think some of the confusion that s arising is because they are they are they are trying to turn things on on very specific indications of what did and did not happen for example the administration is saying that the president may not have been briefed on the underlying intelligence but surely the president was provided with some interpretation perhaps of that data and so what they are trying to say maybe is that he hasn t seen the underlying evidence now that may be true margaret brennan which is not unusual lanhee chen which is not unusual and that may be true but i think the what we really could benefit from here is some clarity margaret brennan right lanhee chen in terms of exactly what the intelligence community is seeing if they are helping bernie sanders and that is an assessment that they are comfortable with i think that s something that should be shared and if there s any confusion i do think that o brien s point was right which is the underlying intelligence ought to be declassified so we can see that the american people margaret brennan well actually that was my point lanhee chen your your point i m sorry margaret brennan he said he couldn t do that lanhee chen good point good point there because because because then that will give the american people some comfort about what s actually going on i do think there is confusion right now there is no question that there is confusion right now margaret brennan yeah susan page usa today susanpage who benefits from confusion russia because if they they may want trump reelected they may want sanders nominated and elected what they mostly want is for us not to believe that we re going to have a free and fair lanhee chen right susan page election that we can trust and they are succeeding on that front margaret brennan and dan it was your paper the washington post that reported russia is attempting to help sanders presidential campaign as part of an effort to interfere with the democratic contest what is unusual is to have the national security adviser talk about this in a political context and there was reaction to o brien commenting in this way it s unusual for someone in that position to do so dan balz washington post danbalz well it s not just unusual it s it s it s supposedly not allowed i mean the national security adviser is supposed to be an official who s dealing only in the national security realm and not involved in partisan politics and so any any suggestion or anything that comes from him that puts him into that realm undermines the role that he s supposed to be playing margaret brennan jamelle i mean the theory of the case here as as susan was saying is that division confusion that s the endgame in and of itself it s not having the manchurian candidate per se jamelle bouie the new york times jbouie cbs news political analyst right right margaret brennan it s just getting people to doubt that the systems and institutions are actually functioning can democrats form a united front here or are they falling prey to some of this because you heard it bubble up a little bit in that biden interview as well where he said i don t buy that these are you know russian bots interfering and spreading hate online that senator sanders is responsible for some of it jamelle bouie i think the first step democrats have to do is do what senator sanders said when he was told or was asked to comment publicly about this to disavow the interference to say that if he s elected president he will reject anything like this and try to stop any kind of election interference into the country and then as far as the entire democratic party goes i i think there needs to be sort of two things going on first yes an awareness that online and other forums there may be russian hackers trolls trying to stirrup things but it s probably not wise to immediately leaned on that as their explanation for the specific reason that it does undermine people s faith and what s happening on on the question of online division maybe that does require all candidates right to say anyone in our camp doing these things needs to cut it out which is what the candidates have been saying but i would recommend it specifically for this problem of maintaining faith in the process to not immediately jump to indistinct russian bots it s russian hackers because that i think does so mistrust and a little bit of fear margaret brennan one of the things that makes sanders you know a candidate who is controversial you know certainly starkly in contrast to joe biden and what he describes there is also some of his rhetoric he tweeted and got some guff for it this week i ve got news for the republican establishment i ve got news for the democratic establishment they can t stop us that was seen as not a message of unity for the party but one of this is an insurgency jamelle bouie right margaret brennan which is divisive jamelle bouie it is divisive i m not sure i guess my perspective on these sorts of things is informed by previous election cycles which is compared to some of the language that emerged in 2016 or 2008 or 2004 it s not that divisive right i i distinctly remember in the 2008 pri democratic primary the candidates clinton obama throwing extremely hard punches at each other saying things that in the moment made it feel like there may not be unity once the primary ended but what happened was unity the party got back together so sanders calling out the republican establishment the democratic establishment that s should have been his brand margaret brennan right jamelle bouie as a national politician and i don t think relative to past contest even relative to this contest is all that divisive i see this is just part of everyone s brand management when it comes to the role they re playing in this primary lanhee chen i mean i i think it s quite divisive in the sense that he s speaking to his base that s who he s communicating to he s communicating to his supporters and we ve seen this movie before by the way in terms of how candidates communicate with the people who support them his message is to his supporters to say look you know you ve been ignored you ve been marginalized no longer i will be your voice i alone can do this we ve heard this rhetoric before so i think it is incredibly divisive for senator sanders to engage in that and and the democratic establishment needs to wake up on this if they re going to stop bernie sanders if they re going to figure out some way to make sure he isn t the nominee that needs to start today not after south carolina not after super tuesday it needs to start today and by the way mike bloomberg could easily engage in this activity he could turn all of his advertising against bernie sanders tomorrow if he wanted to and that s the only way there s a difference made in this race i think susan page you know it s true though it may be divisive or not but it is an accurate depiction of what we see happening and you you mentioned kind of the eerie parallels to the 2016 race on the republican side where you had a very controversial candidate you had a wide field that was much more acceptable to the party establishment that fought with each other and divided the the other side of the and created this path for donald trump to win the nomination and that is what what we see now happening i think with the democrats and with with bernie sanders and the and the only comfort for democrats i think is a lot of democrats don t think bernie sanders can win at a national election a lot of republicans didn t think donald trump could either last time around jamelle bouie i think margaret brennan well bernie excuse me sorry joe biden dan is making the argument for the good of the party that someone like him he prefer him should be the candidate not just for the oval office but because of all the down ballot races essentially warning that democrats are going to lose all leverage or influence or a majority certainly in in the house if they don t go with a more establishment candidate dan balz right and that argument is going to be amped up this week in south carolina and ahead of super tuesday but but to your point about the democratic establishment needs to get together we saw in 2016 that there is no way that an establishment quote unquote within a party can do that i mean what it requires is sacrifice on the part of candidates who are now in the race to say you know what for the good of the cause i m going to step aside well which among these candidates is going to do that other than people who perform so woefully in south carolina on super tuesday that they re essentially driven out of the race margaret brennan well we got that call this week from mike bloomberg jamelle in that leaked memo jamelle bouie right right i i can t imagine the the kinds of people who run for president right are not the kinds of people who are going to save themselves well i guess for the good of the party and and you know the someone else s political prospects i m going to drop out to make sure that this candidate i don t think can win can win i i think it s worth saying in that regards that the analogy the trump falls apart when it comes to trump s favorability within the republican party at this stage of the race sanders at the last poll i saw seventy six percent of democrats have a favorable view of sanders that s higher than any other candidate in the race and for all the talk of reconstituting the obama coalition has just kind of been the drumbeat among democrats margaret brennan mm hm jamelle bouie in the past three years sanders seems to be the one doing it right we see we saw this in nevada pulling together a coalition of union households of minority voters of working class voters to young voters into something that looks like potentially an electoral juggernaut so i i sort of think the certainty among the democratic establishment such that it is that sanders is unelectable runs into the fact that looking at what we know so far he appears to be quite electable based on the measures we use for everyone else margaret brennan lanhee i i want to ask you about someone you know who you worked with in a prior campaign and that is rick grenell lanhee chen mm hm margaret brennan the current ambassador to germany who has stepped into the director of national intelligence role he has no intelligence background what do you think of his appointment to that job at this moment lanhee chen well you know the president puts people around him who he s comfortable with who he believes will be loyal to him the president has that prerogative by the way you know it s not clear to me that this is going to be the permanent appointment i would say that there are a number of people who probably would be a better permanent appointment than than rick grenell but look he has national security experience it s not like he doesn t have any at all you re right he doesn t any intelligence community experience so i think at this point in time the president might be better served with someone who has that experience but to me this is a reflection of how the president has staffed his administration all along margaret brennan mm hm we do have to leave it there thanks to all of you for joining us this week and we will be right back announcements
