always good to have you on the show chris johnson great to be back michael thank you michael morell thank you so much for agreeing to come on and talk about china and covid 19 there is i think a tremendous amount of ground to cover here so let s get started and i think it s always good to start at the beginning and let me start by saying i know you re not a medical expert but what s your take on the debate on the origins of the virus what do we know what don t we know and most important from a china experts perspective what is your sense of why this question is so important chris johnson yeah i think unfortunately none of us are medical experts and feel increasingly sometimes compelled to play one on tv or on a podcast but look i think there seems to be a universal consensus that the disease number one wasn t manmade and two therefore is not a bioweapon there doesn t seem to be any dispute on that in the scientific community or even in the government community and the statement by the director of national intelligence office in my mind just put a very serious period exclamation point on that so i think there s no question as to that so that s what we do know what we don t know i think is exactly where it came from and here obviously the debate seems to be between was it from the wet market in wuhan or could it have leaked from this wuhan institute of virology and on that score from what i can see there appears to be no clear consensus and at least some data i guess you could say on both sides of the coin and that said i m pretty sure there s no smoking gun on the on the issue of did it leak from the lab because in my estimation if the administration had that information they probably would find some way to get it out into the press and so i don t think we see that there have been these allegations about pressure you know my own opinion is that it seems like the intelligence community is doing its best to do its job objectively and the way it s supposed to do it but clearly the president does here seem to see some political advantage in being able to claim this and that might come in handy for him down the road on the issue of you know is it important and does it matter i guess we could say my own opinion which might be somewhat out of track with the conventional wisdom is maybe but really i think going after the labs scenario seems in my mind to be barking up the wrong tree i think the better question is how the government handled it and i hope will address that as they are responsible in my mind at some level for that and with regard to you know the other issues related to the lab scenario i don t think we re ever going to find definitive proof and it doesn t change the fact that this thing has gotten out and is now global and destroying lives everywhere michael morell let me get to the handling question in a second but just one more question about the origin so these wet markets how prevalent are they in china and how big a deal would it be to get rid of them chris johnson they re very prevalent in china and they re all over the country they serve as a major food source for people and i think it would be quite difficult to get rid of them but the government could do it if it wanted to i mean one of the challenges unfortunately is that with chinese culture there are a lot of medicinal supposed additional perceived benefits to to eating certain exotic animals and so on it s been a longstanding problem we have seen the government actually move to push to close these we ll see if they re actually able to do that i think it would be a very massive change for most chinese if they did michael morell ok so let s move then to the handling so you know in the early weeks and then later what did the chinese government get right what did they get wrong are there things they were trying to cover up are there still things they re trying to cover up can you kind of walk us through that chris johnson sure as i mentioned a moment ago i think this is really the crux of the issue and i ll just make several points here the first is that a system like china s or really any authoritarian system is never incentivized to report bad news up the chain right i mean we just know that that is a chronic problem for even for democratic occasionally but certainly for authoritarian governments and the approach that xi jinping has taken in terms of centralizing power in his hands making himself chairman of everything as he s often referred to and just creating a sort of pervasive sense of fear among officials across the country that certainly didn t help the situation and then of course this was all starting to brew right on the eve of chinese new year which is christmas and thanksgiving and new year all wrapped into one for the chinese it s exceptionally important and with xi jinping having been giving a series of these big meetings and speeches on guarding against various forms of risk if you re a local official and you see this outbreak you know coming to play into your territory you re going to hope it goes away and i think we definitely saw a lot of that and the most important aspect i think is what we have seen to now be what i would call a very inconvenient six days from the 14th of january to the 20th where these leaked documents that we ve seen in the press make it very clear that they knew they had a big problem a very dangerous situation on their hands and yet they did not alert either their own public or really the global community and they continued to allow large gatherings to take place and so on and so to the degree there s a smoking gun in terms of the chinese communist party culpability in all this in my mind that s it not the leakage or potential leakage from the wuhan institute of virology so i think that s where really where the focus should be if that s where we re going to go and put that emphasis in terms of what they did right it actually seems to me the lockdown of wuhan seems to have been right and has proven an effective strategy in other countries i was just listening this morning actually to last week s podcast with olivier blanchard and you know he seemed to make the case that from an economic perspective there s no doubt it worked and that that debate should be over and i would agree with that in terms of what they might be trying to cover up you know my sense is it s less a particular issue of covering up than rather a desperate search to change the narrative right they want to change the narrative from this is the place where this thing originated and then foisted it onto the world and caused a global catastrophe to china is a fellow victim of the virus and is now through various multilateral means emphasis multilateral trying to show the world that it can help and be supportive and i m sure we ll talk about the international situation later michael morell so do you believe the case numbers that are coming out of china today chris johnson yeah that s a tough question the short answer is no you know my sense is it s just stupefying to think that a country of 1 4 billion could have you know that few cases but i also don t think it s off by you know 10x or 20x or something like that you know my sense is there s a lot of challenges with the same dynamic i highlighted earlier with if you re in a local territory and you ve been clean for x amount of days the last thing you want to do is show a spike in cases and so the only places where you ve seen those sort of spikes are largely places that are so called imported cases like in the northeast with russia for example heilongjiang province and down in guangdong with some concerns about folks from africa you know there s got to be more than that but it does seem in my mind that it has been very effective and they are ahead of the game there s no doubt about it in my mind michael morell all right so politics how how would you characterize a couple of things one is how xi has played this politically at home and if this has weakened him in any fundamental way and is there in your mind chris a scenario by which this could bring him down chris johnson yeah excellent questions and there s a lot of speculation and theorizing on that i think how i would characterize his sort of position is that i would say it has been dented by the crisis and i ll come back to what i mean by dented but i do not think that it fundamentally gets in the way of his willingness and ability to both seek and get a third term in 2022 and why do i say that several reasons but i think you know my approach to analyzing chinese domestic politics the first principle in my mind has always been look to personnel and that s the key indicator of how a leader is faring and here i think xi has used the crisis very very successfully in terms of putting key allies of his in important positions so if we just look at what s happened in the province of hubei which is where the outbreak was majorly focused he took a guy who was associated with another senior leader and replaced him with one of his own allies and likewise in the in the city party secretaryship of wuhan so those are certainly important developments he also sent one of his top up and coming officials down there to sort of oversee matters and so on so you know he used his network i think very effectively and now these people if they help hubei and wuhan respectively come out of this relatively well they re gonna fly up the of the ranks of the leadership i mean that s certainly the new party secretary young has a great shot at the politburo in 2022 if he s able to manage that and then perhaps even more interestingly he also in recent weeks seems to be taking a tighter grip on the legal and security apparatus of china and this is very important because at the last party congress in 2017 this is the one you know kind of key lever of power that he really didn t get full control of that whole apparatus is basically overseen by a former ally of one of the former leaders it s the one area as i mentioned that he didn t really tighten his grip and now we see him slowly doing that and it s important for two reasons one because he didn t get it the first time two if you re worried about you know future after effects of this then you know the security services is something you want to have a good handle on right so you know collectively i think that means that that he s doing very well but i do think there is an achilles heel here you know you asked about could he be brought down in my mind the weakness or the vulnerability he has at the last party congress he told us all that china s entered this new era right of socialism under his leadership and that was supposed to bring enhanced governance you know a smooth functioning of the country a knowledge based economy and you know basically an asymptotic rise to superpowerdom if you look back over the crisis you have to say objectively that there were certain periods and they may be continuing where china looked a lot more like a third world country again that rising superpower and that i think is a potential vulnerability of his because this is where the ideology comes into it you know he s staked his consolidation of power and all these things he s done on this idea that he s ushering in this new era a smart group of motivated people in the leadership could try to take that on i do not see that happening anytime soon but i do think it s a possible window michael morell interesting and then would you expect chris any long term political implications from covid in china chris johnson yeah i think that s the hardest thing to see i guess the one that jumps immediately to mind would be that it probably could and should prompt a re evaluation on information flows in the system and the power grab that we have seen from xi jinping and especially you know this chairman of everything where nothing can happen unless it s signed off by him and you know he s got a pretty full desk but unfortunately my guess is i expect actually the opposite which will be a further tightening of political control michael morell ok so economics what are we seeing in china now that things are opening up now that people are going back to work are we seeing cases outbreaks of cases in certain areas are we seeing life going back to normal or just people going back to work life staying sort of abnormal so what are we seeing in terms of how all that s playing out chris johnson yeah i think just on the cases issue i find it very interesting you know and rightly so there was a pretty strong presumption that there would be a second wave the minute you know they start to have resumed work activity there i m sure there have been you know small spikes here and there with cases and so on but it seems to be working relatively well and so that really hasn t happened and i think that s very significant actually that that hasn t happened so far on the broader economic trends i mean in my mind i think there are two fundamental tensions that the leadership is grappling with right now the first one is clearly the tension between epidemic control and work resumption right and in my mind the second one is this idea of what they call guarding against financial risk this is this campaign they ve been on for the last couple of years to de risk the financial system versus their traditional stimulus playbook right which is to open all the taps a la 2009 michael morell and the de risking is about lowering the level of debt at the end chris johnson correct that s right smoothing the curve on debt or at least taming its growth they have their they have modest ambitions on that but on the first tension i think you know they re trying clearly to shift to work resumption but the epidemic control issues keep getting in the way right and so that s sort of very much frustrating their efforts i think and on the second one i think we re just now seeing some signs that the traditional stimulus playbook might be i won t say winning out but but you know leaning to one side on that we ve seen some statements after a long period frankly of them being what i would consider very judicious you know compared to what other governments have done you re starting to see some ideas of looser monetary policy maybe more credit flowing and so that you know should be watched very carefully and then i just think there s three big issues the first is that capacity utilization in firms is stuck at running about between you know the high 70s and low 80s percent and the longer that goes on into q2 certainly the more and more difficult that becomes i think for them to achieve anything other than negative growth for all of 2020 and obviously that s very very concerning for them and this is particularly true in the private sector because unlike state owned enterprises they re just unwilling to go to full capacity unless they have some sense there ll be demand for their product and so i think that s huge the second one is what to do with the growth target which is a huge debate obviously now as we re getting ready for this legislative session next month to occur and then i think the last one is there s some debate which is very interesting over what kind of stimulus should they be doing you know it s kind of similar to debates we re having here in our country as i mentioned the traditional playbook is to go whole hog on infrastructure projects bridges to nowhere property you know building that sort of thing some are arguing this is not a typical financial crisis it s more of an economic aneurysm you know and as such the government should be thinking differently and there is a lot of discussion about should we be handing direct cash to small and medium enterprises and individuals the interesting thing is i m hearing that s become something of an ideological issue in the debate and that more conservative elements of the party are saying no no no that looks like the western governments we re trying to show the unique benefits of our system here and the last thing we should be doing is mimicking theirs michael morell so this this legislative session that they ve now called will that help clarify all these questions and will we get a sense of where economic policy is going after that chris johnson for sure we will get the growth target which will be hugely important and the trend line there right now you know the consensus view is what they will announce it will be low probably no higher than three percent and even that could be considered ambitious one interesting idea has been could they announce a sort of multi year growth target so for 2020 don t announce a specific one for 2020 but a net target for 2020 2021 one target is say five percent that would give them a lot more flexibility so that seems to have gotten some some traction we ll also get very importantly the fiscal deficit cap a lot of attention has been focused on that the consensus view seems to be it will go from about 2 8 last year to about 3 5 percent of gdp this year but some of course have said much more than that would be good and then of course for we security geeks you get the defense budget as well and it will just be very interesting to see what they do with that number you know one presumes given the economic shock it should be well below where it s been in the last few years michael morell and anything else that the legislative session will will tell us chris johnson well i think you know there is always an opportunity when they hold the annual legislative session for personnel changes mainly ministerial changes i suppose that s possible i haven t seen you know there hasn t been a lot of rumors about that but of course we still have a full month or so to go before they actually convene in the meeting so that would be worth watching in terms of whether you know some people would be held accountable for the crisis and always always new opportunities there and then secondly there has been some suggestion and some concern i think and rightly so in the white house that china might try to take advantage of what we might call the covid lull to push in particular areas hong kong being one taiwan south china sea and hong kong you know they re still going back and forth about this national security legislation could the chinese legislature try to push through that legislation taking advantage of this this time i think that s unlikely but it could happen michael morell ok so china and the world first question do the chinese see this as an opportunity to gain influence in the world chris johnson most definitely yeah i think so and this is what i was referring to earlier with this idea of trying to change the narrative right and i think it s important to focus on that rather than what some have described as a global disinformation campaign because the latter in my mind suggests confidence and strength and you know trying to trying to push a particular agenda i think they were desperate i mean my sense is if you re sitting in the propaganda department and you re getting instructions from xi jinping and he s telling you you know look you ve got to find a way to change the global narrative here we re dying you know we re looking like the source of a global pandemic and you re thinking how on earth am i going to do that and then you see what happened in europe what s happened in the united states and i think it s fair to say that there were things that were not handled well in both those places especially given that you know in our case in particular we had at least two months arguably to be aware that this could be a big problem that has helped them a lot and so i think they are definitely seeking to use this as an opportunity to once again demonstrate the unique awesomeness shall we say of their particular governance model michael morell so what are all of the steps they re taking to try to take advantage of it besides changing the narrative chris johnson yeah i think clearly we re seeing some efforts at you know the term you hear most frequently is mask diplomacy or things like that there is no doubt i think if we look at the totality of information that they were certainly trying to favor certain places with gifts and aid or getting medical supplies there they ve had a real challenge though in terms of backlash because a lot of countries were so desperate that they were buying this equipment from firms in china who were you know shady and weren t producing good equipment and that s caused an appropriate backlash we ve seen them i think try to further their campaign to increase their role if not take a leading role in some areas in various multilateral organizations we ve certainly seen them try to make sure that taiwan which has been somewhat of an inconvenient truth for them in that you have a democratic ethnically chinese society that has handled the virus very well make sure they don t get back in the who you know that s a big dispute between the chinese and australia for example over that issue right now and other issues so you know we see them really operating on multiple fronts michael morell you know you hear a lot about this disinformation and there s propaganda you you said a few minutes ago you thought that was overplaying it a little bit what s your sense of where that is and what they re doing chris johnson well i think again that my view is i wouldn t want to evaluate something that in my mind could be weakness and then call it strength and so i think that s very important the second issue is that is that you know they re clearly making a major push here and they ve handled it badly and i think what s most striking is you know again this could be a very strong implication unintended consequence of you know sort of the way xi jinping is running the country he made a probably a flip comment you know sometime ago encouraging his diplomats to show more fighting spirit and this has led to the wolf warrior diplomat and a whole bunch like him spewing this stuff out over twitter questioning the origins of the disease and so on and there s no doubt that that stuff has backfired on them and then i think you know we have seen there s no doubt there s been some things that look eerily similar to some of what the russians were doing in 2016 in terms of bots in reporting things on false facebook accounts and so on my assessment i m not a technical expert but my assessment is it s not anywhere near on the scale of russia s disinformation efforts but the chinese haven t traditionally done that kind of stuff so that is a little troubling michael morell and chris this is a little off topic but do you see is there anything that leads you to believe that the chinese may be trying to influence the 2020 election here as the russians have to do in 2016 chris johnson i haven t seen anything that would convince me of that i mean i think they are certainly trying to you know influence where they can they have a number of platforms that they use to try to you know manage opinion in the chinese and the ethnic chinese community in the u s certainly certainly they re trying to use some of their leverage over the business community to you know do certain things but you know we saw the president come out the other day i believe and say that you know he believes the chinese want him to lose the election i personally haven t seen anything that would suggest to me that that s where their attitude is at this point michael morell if they could if they had a choice here which candidate would they choose you know with trump they have great disarray here but they also have somebody who has who has taken a yardstick to them right on a number of issues you know with biden they d get more stability but they also you know they get a softer approach so do you have a sense on who they would choose chris johnson my sense is i think maybe they ve to some degree sort of come out as a wash now i think early in the contest on the democrat side their preference would have been for joe biden because they have a lot of familiarity with him as vice president former vice president biden he spent a great deal of time with xi jinping when xi jinping was the vice president of china and he was getting ready to take over the presidency and you know he is a sort of more free trade nontariff touting you know kind of kind of guy but then i think there was an assessment early on that he s got no chance so i guess you know while trump is erratic as you pointed out he is the devil we know and we think you know generally speaking we know how to handle this guy and as you pointed out the upside for them is global disarray from a lack of u s leadership and they certainly have been exploiting that but then now biden emerges you know it seems from the process and so now i i m guessing they re wondering you know what s the best outcome for them but my guess is they probably feel it will be ok one way or the other michael morell so let s go back to this this issue of them trying to use covid 19 as an opportunity to expand their influence do you think they think they re being effective here chris johnson i think it s a mixed bag i think you know unfortunately as i was mentioning earlier their system has unique yardsticks by which they measure success so in other words they only have a certain playbook and they can t really exceed it i think the key factor in all of this in terms of effectiveness will be before this kind of the advent of the xi jinping era and this sort of stronger more forward leaning china when they would make mistakes they would learn from them and we would see them adjust their behavior they were very good at that for many years that has not been the case over the last eight plus years and it will be interesting to see in this instance if they re able to do that i haven t seen much indication of it so far but i think it will be important and then i think the other thing in terms of effectiveness that will be very telling is that given the head start they had on the rest of the world there is a lot of pushback we see it in europe we see it here you know and so on if however their economy gets on a pretty good footing much sooner than the global economies and they start demanding product from economies that are just starting to reopen well that could change a lot of people s tunes michael morell and you know one of the things to think about is is emerging markets and you know what is going to be a debt and currency crisis in emerging markets and is the imf and world bank and do they have enough funds to deal with that and then you start looking around the world and who does and it s the chinese right that that may end up giving them much more influence then then mask diplomacy chris johnson definitely i think so and we re already seeing a lot of conversation about you know canceling or suspending debt payments with africa there s a lot of discussion now about what they re going to do with various b r programs i mean belt and road initiative programs i don t think they re they re going to be able to write off the loans but they might accept something where they get the principal payment over whatever very long timeline and some minimal percentage of interest so it s a huge opportunity for them you know i hear that there s a lot of discussion about thinking about it about the way they played the financial at the asian financial crisis in 1997 right where everyone expected them to devalue and they didn t and that was remembered for a long time in terms of soft power in the region michael morell and i guess the other advantage of stimulus you know in in china is not only the domestic benefit of it but the benefit you get from pulling other economies along with you chris johnson for sure yeah i mean if you look at commodity prices right now they re crashing and so if they start building a lot of infrastructure projects they need commodities to to so michael morell okay so let s let s finish up with with maybe the most interesting piece here which is the u s china relationship you know it feels it feels to a non china expert that we re in a bit of a death spiral here what s your sense chris johnson it feels like that to a china expert too i mean look i would say it s fair to say that this is definitely been a roller coaster ride of recent but the direction of travel doesn t seem particularly great and especially over the last week we had what seemed like a notional truce when presidents trump and xi had a phone call now about three and a half four weeks ago and it seemed that the exchange basically revolved around ok both sides need to tone down this rhetoric you know on their side questioning the origin on our side calling it the wuhan virus and that seemed to work for a little bit and there was some speculation that the two sides had decided to see if they couldn t put out some kind of joint statement on cooperation on covid in general well that was three plus weeks maybe a month ago now the statement still hasn t emerged it might emerge but it hasn t and if we can t work together on something as simple as what presumably is a fairly anodyne statement then it does raise questions about how we re going to talk about thorny ip issues and so on and then i think just in general within the u s administration from what i m seeing and hearing there seem to be two streams i guess or two channels in the administration the first is i think what we might call the campaign team and they clearly are seeing indications from polling and and just response to ads that they re making such as this beijingbiden movement and so on that this has legs and could help the president win re election and i think you know trump is very much on board with that stream of thinking the other is what i would call the sort of decoupling 2 0 camp and here i think it s mainly the administration hawks like secretary of state mike pompeo national security adviser o brien and his deputy matt pottinger these sort of folks and here i think you know going back to the very early days of the administration when steve bannon was around there was a serious effort to get it to produce what i call sort of speedier slow moving decoupling and you know that s kind of what you can really do in any realistic timeframe and you know they put it up the flagpole the economic team or advisers seem to kind of win out it went nowhere i think there is a group that sees coronavirus and the implications of that for the u s as an opportunity to try that again and they re working very hard so the real important question then i think becomes are there distinguishable this differences between these two camps in other words for the president is it just about a re election effort and so on or is he having some kind of a change of heart in terms of how he sees this and i will say that in the last week or so we re seeing more signs that these two tracks are converging in other words whatever distinctions or differences were there before are now no longer there and i think that s a bit troubling michael morell and then your assessment chris of the potential impact long term on the relationship from covid chris johnson yeah i think you know it doesn t bode well i mean one of the things that was really challenging was that we never really got the chance after the phase one trade deal was agreed late last year we never really got the chance to see if there could be any afterglow if you will from that because we basically went from that almost directly into covid and covid response and so that has made things more difficult i think when we eventually are able to resume some kind of a functioning economic and trade dialogue with the chinese all of this will be there as a backdrop right and so i think that makes those conversations potentially more difficult i mean one bright spot i think has been it does seem that ambassador lighthizer at ustr he really seems to have had the only functioning channel if you will of u s china communication you know the state department basically is not talking to its counterpart the ministry of foreign affairs and so there has seemed to have been an effort to kind of silo off the economic relationship so let s see if that can survive you know when we do get back to some sort of normal channel if not i think it s going to be really messy and the dynamics of the campaign i mean you know china has featured prominently in the last several u s election campaigns but usually it s one side or the other going after the chinese i think it can be very hard for mr biden to to avoid having to get on that train as well and that can make things really bumpy michael morell and just remind us chris of your sense of where we re headed over the longer term with the chinese chris johnson you know i think it s probably toward some kind of you know very uncomfortable slow motion decoupling i think that s really where we re going certainly we continue to see a series of of sort of measures coming out of the commerce department there was just one last week trying to tackle the issue of civil military integration as it s called in china i e you know technology that goes to notionally civilian companies in china but those companies have some interaction with the chinese military you know arguably that s a very real concern but obviously it will have a serious impact on a lot of u s companies because they will now either need to apply for licenses or they may just not be able to sell those products to those chinese companies anymore there is this apparent directive that s working its way through the system that would seek to sever the link between important foreign semiconductor makers like taiwan semiconductor and huawei in china so you can kind of see that the trend line going here and i expect that to continue and i think if there is a change of administration it might look a little different it might take a little longer but it does seem that a lot of these trends are becoming hard wired which is disappointing michael morell all right chris thank you so much for joining us it is always fantastic to have you on the show you are incredibly insightful and i continue to call you the best china analyst inside or outside of government so thank you very much for taking the time chris johnson thank you michael my pleasure first published on may 6 2020 6 02 am 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights
