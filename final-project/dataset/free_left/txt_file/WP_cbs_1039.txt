suspension of active campaigning and congratulate joe biden a very decent man on his victory he said addressing supporters from his burlington vermont home via livestream sanders who early in the primary process was seen as the favorite to win the democratic nomination said if i believed we had a feasible path to the nomination i would certainly continue the campaign but it s not there sanders told supporters the covid 19 crisis played a large role in his decision to leave the race i cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour he said remarkably sanders never made a speech like this in 2016 he rode the campaign into the convention without ever having said the words he did today but what is similar to 2016 is that sanders is not yielding all his influence just yet i will stay on the ballot in all remaining states and continue to gather delegates he said while vice president biden will be the nominee we should still work to assemble as many delegates as possible at the democratic convention where we will be able to exert significant influence over the party platform and other functions then together standing united we will go forward to defeat donald trump the most dangerous president in modern american history the move is signature sanders the senator is throwing his metaphorical support behind biden whom he has always called a friend all the while fanning the movement he leads we will fight to elect strong progressives at every level of government from congress to the school board sanders has always referred to his progressive platform as a growing tide that represents the inevitable future of the party while the path may be slower now we will change this country and with like minded friends around the globe the entire world he said in his final words to supporters today he said please stay in this fight with me let us go forward together the struggle continues joe biden and sanders spoke around midday today about the senator s decision to suspend his campaign a source familiar with the call toldcbs news political correspondent ed o

vetting process requires immense resources biden launched his third bid for the white house in pittsburgh 349 days ago the trail for him at times has been rocky but his campaign s core message of electability won out as democratic voters consolidated around him as other moderate democratic candidates left the race if elected biden would be just the fourth former vice president to be elected

plans to spend six figures on the 30 second spot according to a trump campaign spokesperson bernie sanders and joe biden a big government socialist and a big government liberal the advertisement reads in part they re more alike than you think but at least bernie remembers his positions with bernie sanders suspending his campaign it s all but official that the democrat establishment got the candidate they wanted in joe biden as well as the candidate president trump will destroy in november trump campaign manager brad parscale said in a statement following the sanders announcement president trump is still disrupting washington dc while biden represents the old tired way and continuing to coddle the communist regime in china democrat elites shoved bernie sanders to the side for

mitchellreports this move comes one week after the state began mailing absentee ballot request forms to its 6 9 million active voters in an effort to reduce the amount of in person interaction amid the covid 19 pandemic georgia s governor and top legislators extended the state s public health state of emergency wednesday as more than 9 000 cases have been confirmed and 362 deaths have been reported throughout the state in a release sent wednesday the georgia democratic party stated that this is the first time in the state s history that voters have been proactively sent an application to vote by mail and as a result many voters may be unfamiliar with the process in 2018 only 7 of voters voted absentee by mail the release stated however in the midst of the covid 19 pandemic and with in person voting locations closing at alarming rates the state along with the democratic party of georgia are encouraging all voters to vote by mail who are able as the dpg and dnc encourage georgia voters to vote by mail the aclufileda federal lawsuit wednesday against georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger and the dekalb county board of registration and elections the complaint challenges whether georgia voters should be required to provide their own postage stamps when returning their absentee ballots and ballot applications by mail the aclu on behalf of black voters matters filed the complaint calling it a poll tax for voters to have to buy postage by refusing to provide voters with postage paid envelopes the secretary of state has not only imposed a poll tax on individual voters he has placed an undue burden on the organizations dedicated to increasing voter turnout said cliff albright co founder and executive director of black voters matter fund in a statement every minute and every dime we spend helping voters to navigate the postage requirement means we have fewer resources for other voter mobilization efforts given the history of the secretary of state s office viewing voter mobilization organizations as threats one can t help but wonder if this undue burden was actually one of his objectives the aclu said the group would seek a preliminary injunction to require election officials to provide prepaid returnable envelopes for absentee ballots and absentee ballot applications during a press conference earlier this week to announce the creation of an absentee ballot fraud task force to investigate potential absentee ballot discrepancies raffensperger noted in his remarks that georgians could use an email address that was provided to send theirs if they didn t have access to stamps georgia democratic party chair nikema williamstoldmitchell in an interview monday that the creation of the task force was an attempt to intimidate and dissuade voters from using absentee ballots and potentially not cast their votes the aclu lawsuit outlines in part that many lower income voters don t have postage stamps lack transportation access to get postage stamps in rural communities and don t have internet access or a credit card to buy stamps online the complaint adds that voters cannot be expected to needlessly expose themselves to the pandemic just to get stamps in order to vote in a statement sophia lin lakin deputy director of the aclu s voting rights project said no one should have to choose between protecting their health and their right to vote she added in failing to provide prepaid postage for absentee ballots georgia is creating an unconstitutional obstacle to voting we won t allow for a modern day poll tax minnesota minnesota
