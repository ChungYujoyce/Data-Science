this article originally appeared on alternet another gopdebate another steaming pile of half truths lies and pseudo facts the republican party seems to be almost entirely post truth at this point and if you call them out you re the liberal media it s a brilliant racket and one that led us to the current state of affairs where facts aren t just dispensable but a political liability without further ado here are the top lies and distortions from tonight s debate 1 ben carson and ted cruz we cannot vet refugees a popular refrain in the wake of the paris and san bernadino attacks is that the u s government or more specifically president obama cannot properly vet syrian refugees this has been repeatedly debunked as hysterical posturing yet remains a popular trope among the far right in addition to a ratherthorough takedownby john oliver two weeks ago politicofact rated this claim mostly false in itsdetailed analysisthis evening 2 marco rubio claims assad created isis this is an old canard and one that even nominally lefty outlets like vox like to push but it has little to do with reality in an effort to shore up his neocon credentials rubio has doubled down on regime change in syria while other gop candidates like paul and cruz as well as bernie sanders have run away from this position to do this rubio has pushed the conspiracy theory that the reason isis grew in syria is because the u s didn t back the rebels opposed to assad when in fact the cia according to documents revealed by edward snowden spent 1 billion a yeararming funding and assisting the opposition 3 donald trump citesboguspoll that 25 of muslims condone acts ofviolence a popular trope among the nativist wing of the republican party aka the republican party the bogus stat that 25 of muslins support violence is thrown around quite often but it originates from noted islamophobic think tank center for security policy as thenew york timesnotes mr trump vouched for the group at a rally on monday night but the poll conducted by thepolling company a republican firm is in no way truly representative of all muslim americans because of its methodology the poll was not based on a random sample but included only people who chose to participate and therefore is not representative of the population being studied in addition some of the questions were leading and biased 4 chris christie insists he was appointed u s attorney on sept10 2001 why does christie keep repeating this lie it s been debunked several times and it s a matter of public record it s a great soundbite to be sure and if true would put christie in the heart of the most significant foreign policy crisis of the past 20 years but the reality is that george w bush nominated christie on dec 7 2001 as one can clearly see from a white housepress release 5 ted cruz claims george w bush deported 10 million people geroge w bushdeported 1 8 million people obama deported 2 million it s unclear where cruz is getting this number from 6 donald trump keeps saying he self funds but we know that s demonstrably false this is another assertion that s completely disproven and easily searchable online which raises the question of why cnn hasn t bothered doing this trump has received according to the last available fec filings upward of 3 9 millionfrom individual donors compared to using only 101 000 of his own money how does this fit with his self funded narrative it s unclear but perhaps a more urgent question is why would any sane persondonatemoney to someone who claims to have over 10 billion 7 moderator lie cnn s wolf blitzer claimed terrorism fears are higher than they ve been since 9 11 that s not true a recent gallup poll shows terrorism fears have spiked recently but arethe sameas in 2005 and nowhere near as high as after 9 11 8 lie by omission why was the attack on planned parenthood not mentioned in a debate about terrorism as sean mcelwee of demosnoted in a debate that was nominally about terrorism non muslim terrorism was completely absent the recent planned parenthood terrorist attack carried out by a man whoclaimsto be a warrior for babies wasn t discussed in the broader context of terrorism why this is so remains unclear 9 lie by cliche what the hell is fiorina talking about fiorina keeps referencing building up the sixth fleet because presumably it sounds like some important walk and talk dialogue in the west wing but itactually makes no sense several expertshave chimed in on this strange refrain and pointed out that it s basically nonsense as military magazinestars and stripesnoted her meaning wasn t immediately clear the u s 6th fleet is less a collection of ships than a command structure for operating american warships in the atlantic and mediterranean moreover the fleet is one of the few growing military commands in europe it is building land based missile interceptor sites in romania and poland and in the coming days it will welcome the last of four guided missile destroyers to arrive for permanent stationing in rota spain 10 severalcandidateskeep claiming the iran deal gives 150 billion to iran as thela times notes it s not giving 150 billion to iran it s relieving sanctions that will ultimately unfreeze more than 150 billion in assets to iran but the funds were already iran s to begin with no one is giving iran anything copyright 2019 salon com
