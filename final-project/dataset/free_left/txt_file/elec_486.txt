on friday donald trump tried to walk back his claim that president obama is the founder of isis in the most trump way possible he simply blamed the media for taking him so seriously they don t get sarcasm he tweeted of cnn s coverage ratings challenged cnn reports so seriously that i call president obama and clinton the founder of isis mvp they don t get sarcasm i love watching these poor pathetic people pundits on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out they can t what makes trump s new excuse so absurd and so unnerving is what it says about how he d fare as president people all around the world tend to take what the president of the united states says very seriously which is why presidents don t usually make a habit of communicating through sarcasm or by saying things and then claiming they weren t serious presidents don t go out and constantly joke about invading countries or about their economic policies or about their political opponents being terrorists they tend to put thought into what they say because the risk of being misunderstood is too high the fact that cnn and others will take what you say seriously is the whole point this whole flap started on wednesday when trump called obama the founder of isis hillary clinton is the co founder he said conservative pundit hugh hewitt asked trump if that s what he really meant in an interview on thursday trump stood his ground like many conservatives he believes obama and clinton s policies in iraq allowed isis to expand and to him that s the same thing as obama and clinton founding isis hugh hewitt i think i would say they created they lost the peace they created the libyan vacuum they created the vacuum into which isis came but they didn t create isis that s what i would say donald trump well i disagree i mean with his bad policies that s why isis came about if he would have done things properly you wouldn t have had isis therefore he was the founder of isis hugh hewitt i d just use different language to communicate it it s pretty clear that trump wasn t joking in fact he seemed keen to insist that founder was the correct word here set aside the fact that trump is wrong on the merits here the rise of isis involved a multitude of factors that obama and clinton were largely not a part of set aside the fact that trump is stretching the definition of founder here the key point is that this was not sarcasm trump was trying to make a point here and now he s upset that the media has taken that point so seriously any successful presidential candidate usually needs two key traits argues david greenberg a historian at rutgers university spontaneity and discipline but each needs to be deployed at the right time trump has the spontaneity his shoot from the hip bluntness is one reason he s so popular with voters there is this kind of long tradition in our politics especially in the last 30 or 40 years of valuing candidates who are spontaneous and unfiltered says greenberg because there is so much spin and crafted talk in politics that we get frustrated with it we naturally respond to people that seem more candid but any good presidential candidate also needs discipline in part because the presidency requires it particularly around delicate subjects like diplomacy or managing the financial system where one stray remark can cause a crisis and trump utterly lacks discipline he puts himself in the headlines with inflammatory remarks almost daily and can t seem to help himself he enjoys making provocative statements and because he is not a seasoned politician he doesn t know when it will misfire says greenberg trump takes this lack of discipline one step further with another key habit he never apologizes his campaign usually just tries to flatly deny that he said anything or stretch the meanings of words so far they lose all semblance of what was obviously said or else trump just claims he was joking that s a very dangerous quality for someone who wants to become president my colleague zack beauchamp writes a poorly phrased statement by the most powerful person in the world doesn t just help amplify bad ideas it can actively cause an international crisis get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
