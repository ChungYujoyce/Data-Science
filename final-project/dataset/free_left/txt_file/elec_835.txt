advertisement supported by by mark landler and steven lee myers washington the dispute over hillary clinton s email practices now threatens to shadow her for the rest of the presidential campaign after the disclosure on monday that the f b i collected nearly 15 000 new emails in its investigation of her and a federal judge s order that the state department accelerate the documents release as a result thousands of emails that mrs clinton did not voluntarily turn over to the state department last year could be released just weeks before the election in november the order by judge james e boasberg of federal district court came the same day a conservative watchdog group separately released hundreds of emails from one of mrs clinton s closest aides huma abedin which put a new focus on the sometimes awkward ties between the clinton foundation and the state department the f b i discovered the roughly 14 900 emails by scouring mrs clinton s server and the computer archives of government officials with whom she corresponded in late july it turned them over to the state department which now must set a timetable for their release according to judge boasberg s order while the emails were not in the original trove of 55 000 pages that mrs clinton s lawyers handed to the state department last year the f b i director james b comey said in july that he did not believe they had been intentionally deleted still he characterized mrs clinton s handling of classified information during her years at the state department as extremely careless under the likely timetable the soonest the new emails would be released is october the state department released the original emails in monthly installments over nearly a year through february though it missed several court ordered deadlines as its staff and other agencies scrutinized the documents for classified information despite mr comey s conclusion that mrs clinton mishandled classified information he said last month that the f b i would not recommend criminal charges against her which finally seemed to ease the threat that her handling of emails has posed to her presidential campaign but the prospect of further disclosures from mrs clinton s emails suggests that the issue will not be put to rest so easily hillary clinton seems incapable of telling the truth the chairman of the republican national committee reince priebus said in a statement the process for reviewing these emails needs to be expedited public disclosure should begin before early voting starts and the emails in question should be released in full before election day the clinton campaign said mrs clinton had turned over all the work related emails she had in her possession in 2014 to the state department we are not sure what additional materials the justice department may have located said the campaign s spokesman brian fallon but if the state department determines any of them to be work related then obviously we support those documents being released publicly as well a state department spokesman mark c toner said it would have to review the documents to determine which were personal or work related and whether any duplicated emails had already been released in response to lawsuits brought by the conservative watchdog group judicial watch under the freedom of information act the f b i recently uncovered new emails potentially related to the investigation into hillary clinton s private email server the group said that the 725 pages of documents it released monday demonstrated efforts by the clinton family foundation to leverage its influence with mrs clinton the emails drawn from ms abedin included an appeal by douglas band a clinton foundation executive for mrs clinton to meet with bahrain s crown prince whose family had contributed millions of dollars to the foundation good friend of ours mr band wrote ms abedin after expressing mrs clinton s reluctance to schedule a meeting until she knows how she will feel then wrote back to mr band to offer the crown prince an appointment the next morning she encouraged mr band to let the prince know if you see him though she said the state department had also contacted him through official channels but ms abedin expressed qualms when mr band appealed to her to help arrange an interview in the british embassy to get a visa for a member of the wolverhampton football club who had a criminal charge against him mr band was helping casey wasserman a sports marketing executive who had donated money to the clinton foundation mr wasserman is a co chairman of a fund raiser mrs clinton will attend this week in beverly hills calif i get this now makes me nervous to get involved but i ll ask ms abedin wrote then don t mr band replied judicial watch s president tom fitton said the emails included 20 exchanges with mrs clinton herself that were not among those her lawyers turned over to the state department the emails he said showed how ms abedin served as a conduit between the department and the clinton foundation citing the exchange over the crown prince s meeting it is hard to tell where the state department ended and where the clinton foundation began he said they were working hand in glove under the process set by judge boasberg on monday the state department will review the new emails and documents and present the court with a schedule for releasing them mr fitton said that process could begin in october or could be delayed as the department reviews which are personal and which are work related the question is how many of those are truly personal he said separately a prominent house republican pressed the f b i on monday to explain why it had redacted emails and summaries of its interview with mrs clinton which it turned over to congress last week representative jason chaffetz republican of utah and chairman of the house committee on oversight and government reform said in an interview that nearly half the material was redacted including a lot of redactions for things that aren t warranted he also said there were inconsistencies in the two copies of the documents that the f b i submitted to congress in a letter to mr comey on monday mr chaffetz demanded that the f b i explain its legal basis for the redactions and why the two copies were inconsistent he said the f b i should submit an unclassified version of its report which presumably could be made public advertisement
