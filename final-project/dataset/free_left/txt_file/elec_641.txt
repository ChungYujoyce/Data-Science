 the politico caucus most pan ted cruz s non endorsement speech as a selfish act by steven shepard 07 22 2016 07 56 am edt getty politico illustration cleveland donald trump s acceptance speech hit the mark thursday night drawing accolades from a number of gop political insiders who had doubted his competence to lead the republican ticket this fall that s according to the politico caucus a panel of operatives activists and strategists in 11 battleground states surveyed immediately following trump s speech fifty six percent of republican insiders said trump s speech a forceful indictment of those responsible for what he perceives as a country in decline along with an assurance that he is uniquely qualified to solve the nation s ills made them feel more confident in his candidacy advertisement trump gave a simple message and expanded the republican party law and order economic populism and defeat the rigged system said one iowa republican who like all respondents completed the survey anonymously i felt trump gave a very good speech and struck on issues and policies that people wanted to hear about added a colorado republican his family and friends did an excellent job of showing the softer side of donald trump and gave america a good view of his family which says a lot about him as a person i think he is absolutely right this is a movement not a normal campaign people have had enough of tired politicians i think they are going to give him the chance to run the country added a pennsylvania republican he talked to the people he needed to very effectively the speech defined the race and made him a voice for the people something he should have done months ago for many of the gop insiders trump s acceptance speech thursday night helped overcome other rockier moments this week including ted cruz s speech in which the texas senator declined to endorse trump despite angry protestations from the crowd at quicken loans arena fifty nine percent of republicans picked trump s acceptance speech as the defining moment of the convention far more than the 28 percent who said cruz s televised snub defined the week the cruz speech received poor marks from those same republican insiders four in five said it was a selfish act to address the convention without getting behind trump only 20 percent described it as a principled stand cruz showed his true colors as just another craven politician willing to put his own political ambition ahead of the interests of the party and the country a colorado republican said it s a risky bet if hillary wins in november as a result of the divisions cruz continues to foment within the party the gop will hold the senator from texas partially responsible for the multiple justices that clinton will appoint to the supreme court undermining the very conservative principles and constitution ted cruz claims to champion cruz almost looks like he trying to ensure that hillary will win so he can run against her in 2020 added a virginia republican it was beyond selfish a wisconsin republican said it was beyond stupid and showed ted cruz for what he is cruz s speech was a head shaking moment and he s toast in 2020 compare him to ryan trump certainly still has his republican critics twenty percent said the speech made them less confident in him and a number of them were despondent in what they saw as an apocalyptic view of the country when voters want to be inspired it s not morning in america it s midnight in america according to trump a colorado republican said this was a long depressing speech that did not focus on issues that most americans are concerned about specifically the economy added a new hampshire republican we have handed our party over to a narcissistic feckless classless rino strongman wannabe who is the only candidate that actually gives the horrid hillary clinton a chance to win democrats largely agreed the consensus among insiders wasn t that trump will emerge from cleveland as a stronger candidate instead many of them believed he delivered a dark angry speech that served as the capstone of an unusual and damaging convention for the gop as a democrat i heard trump describe a post apocalyptic country that i don t live in full of fear terror and pending economic collapse a colorado democrat said it seemed like a speech to white america or those in white america who fear the social cultural and economic change in our country the whole thing was a dumpster fire a florida democrat said of the convention but trump s dark troubling and borderline anti american speech will define it in fact the vast majority of democrats 63 percent said cruz s nonendorsement was the defining moment of a convention that in their eyes left the gop more divided than united it was a defining moment of an ill conceived and poorly executed convention one iowa democrat said but there were some signs that trump struck a chord with some of his tougher gop critics one nevada republican called it shockingly measured with populist lines that real people will like another new hampshire republican called it the best speech trump has given thus far but probably still not good enough the
