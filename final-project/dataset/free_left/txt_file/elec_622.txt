 2016 it s not just iraq bush repeatedly insists he won t yield to popular pressure until he does by marc caputo 05 16 2015 06 14 am edt after a week of misinterpreting misspeaking and mismanaging the media over his position on the iraq war jeb bush s hoped for shock and awe campaign in waiting looked nothing like a political juggernaut it s the bad news bears quipped dave bossie president of the citizens united conservative group the problem for jeb bush is he didn t look very agile he didn t look smart in the sense of a rapid response communications system that could get him out of the trouble he was in advertisement more troubling for bush is that many supporters are getting jittery because he appeared ill equipped to appreciate and manage the demands of the modern day 24 hour news cycle and they note this isn t the first time bush has floundered over what he believes a waffling that could undermine his reputation as a deep thinking ideas man comfortable in his own skin one who decries politicians who just bend with the wind but bush appeared to do just that last month according to conservatives who criticized his shifting positions over indiana s religious freedom restoration act which allowed some businesses to deny some services in effect to gays based on the owner s religious views bush said it was the right thing to do then an anti discrimination national backlash against indiana brewed the state clarified the law to ensure it didn t allow for discrimination based on people s sexual orientation or gender identification bush changed right along with it by saying the law was in the right place because we shouldn t discriminate based on sexual orientation jeb bush backtracks on religious liberty a reason blogger wrote how does jeb bush feel about rfra apparently he can t decide the blog chicks on the right opined jeb bush seems to shift tone on indiana rfra at fundraiser said a hot air blog headline eli stokols bush was in eerily similar circumstances two years before in 2013 when he was plugging his new book immigration wars forging an american solution the former florida governor who previously supported a pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants wrote that he now backed a pathway to legal residency only those who violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship bush and co author clint bolick wrote oops by the time bush s book was out the political landscape had briefly shifted and his longtime friend and prot g sen marco rubio was at the time a member of the so called gang of eight that proposed a pathway to citizenship in its legislation so bush after fumbling to explain his change of heart reversed course again and explained that he supported a pathway to residency because he generally thought it was the most politically palatable option when he was penning the book before the gang of eight bill i have supported both both a path to legalization or a path to citizenship with the underlying principle being that there should be no incentive for people to come illegally at the expense of coming legally bush told cnn in a tortured explanation that the new york times described bush as backpedaling as political re entries go jeb bush s has been rocky the times wrote on march 5 2013 welcome to life as a potential presidential candidate when you leave open the door to a presidential bid and are no long just an elder statesman for the party every little thing starts to become magnified which has happened to jeb bush over the past 24 hours nbc s first read blog wrote at the time here s something to remember about bush he hasn t run a race since 2002 before facebook twitter and more partisan media change the dates and the topic and bush s multiple explanations and prolonged waffling are much like what happened to him in describing the iraq war to fox s megan kelly who asked last saturday if he would have invaded iraq knowing what we know now bush said yes and falsely said hillary clinton would have done the same thing jonathan topaz and katie glueck after that interview which took place saturday some in bush s orbit realized he might have a problem and discussed whether to call kelly to clarify his remarks on sunday fox published a news story teasing the interview that was to air the following day once the interview aired critics and opponents pounced on tuesday morning bush s longtime friend and cnn commentator ana navarro said on the network that she asked bush what he meant because even she was confused navarro said bush told her that he misheard the question some in bush s inner circle were furious with navarro and blamed her for making the situation worse though many believe she felt the need to try to protect her friend as the situation spiraled out of control without an adequate explanation bush finally decided to address the issue in a softball interview tuesday on conservative commentator sean hannity s radio show where he explained he interpreted the question wrong i guess bush said he believed the question referred to what he would have done with the available intelligence at the time i don t know what that decision would have been that s a hypothetical but the simple fact is that mistakes were made bush said on wednesday at a nevada event bush continued to refuse to answer hypotheticals and said that in this case such speculation does a disservice for a lot of people that sacrificed a lot he then had a testy exchange with a college student who accused him of being pedantic in responding to her finally after four days and four different explanations bush broke down if we re all supposed to answer hypothetical questions knowing what we now know what would you have done i would not have engaged i would not have gone into iraq former republican consultant ed rollins who worked on ronald reagan s campaigns as well as mike huckabee s 2008 race said running for president today takes a deep appreciation for the changes in the news media cycle and he said it didn t appear bush was aware of that both he and hillary clinton don t appear ready for prime time she s had the worst few weeks of any candidate i ve ever seen and jeb was a close second this week rollins said but she has no real democratic challenger while he s got a very very tough battle in the republican primary he can t afford to make these types of mistakes making a basic misstep like that with a question that was perfectly 100 percent predictable is frankly astonishing randy scheunemann a former adviser to defense secretary donald rumsfeld under bush s brother told buzzfeed it does not bode well for his candidacy state rep matt gaetz a bush backer said the coverage surrounding bush s statements over iraq was overblown he said that voters would ultimately support bush because in the end they would view his comments and his accessibility in stark contrast to the off limits clinton as authentic but many longtime bush supporters were baffled jeb doesn t surround himself with yes men but he hates being handled and this is what happens when you don t have a real campaign when you don t have someone who manages the candidate because he s not really a candidate said one longtime bush backing republican and even if jeb was prepared if he had his talking points he obviously didn t prepare enough eli stokols and dylan byers another bush supporter pointed out that bush before kelly s interview had just come from a speech at liberty university in virginia he was likely tired and he underestimated the importance of the interview he probably thought oh it s fox it s a friendly interview and he got caught with his guard down and this is like boxing without a rest never let your guard down the supporter said one bush donor said the problem with bush s management of the situation gives rubio an opening to win republicans who were already concerned with bush s electability these gaffes only serve to make marco rubio and ted cruz more serious candidates said bossie the citizens united president this isn t a fatal mistake it s nothing that 100 million can t fix said bossie referring to the quarterly fundraising goal the bush camp hopes to meet by the end of this month bossie said he believed bush needed to declare his candidacy so he can have a traditional campaign infrastructure around him to help him handle all of the rigors of the campaign trail bush made clear in his fox interview that he wasn t yet a candidate and he seemed not to realize that he d just made a mistake that could ripple across the 2016 race for months to come here s the deal megyn bush said if i go beyond the consideration of running to be an actual candidate do you want people to just bend with the wind to mirror people s sentiment whoever is in front of you oh yes i used to be for that but now i m for this is that the way we want to elect presidents correction a previous version of this article
