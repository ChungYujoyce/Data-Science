the following is a transcript of an interview of former fda commissioner scott gottlieb by cbs news margaret brennan that aired sunday march 15 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan and we re back now with former fda commissioner dr scott gottlieb good to see you here back for another week dr scott gottlieb thanks margaret brennan and you ve been telling us sort of what to prepare for next and i want to dive into some of that with you you heard dr fauci say they re coming but they re not really here yet in terms of kits and availability to actually go and have it processed if you need a test what s the timeline dr gottlieb well i think we re going to see a dramatic increase in diagnostic capability this week so i think by the end of the week tests are going to be readily available they were they approved tests on what we call high throughput systems meaning systems that can run literally tens of thousands of tests a day inside academic labs or the large clinical labs like labcorp and quest once those facilities have those systems online they re going to be able to process an awful lot of tests and they ll have them online at some point this week so by friday i think tests testing is going to be pretty ubiquitous margaret brennan now hospitals are trying to plan for the future here how are they positioned are there enough medical supplies dr gottlieb not if we have a wuhan style outbreak in a major city or multiple cities which is my concern that we can have outbreaks of that proportion in multiple u s cities if you look at wuhan at the peak margaret brennan a wuhan style dr gottlieb a wuhan margaret brennan so you re saying the numbers that we are seeing and have seen in china dr gottlieb right in in a major u s city remember wuhan was the size of new york city at the peak of that epidemic they hospitalized about 20 thousand people ten thousand were in serious or critical condition and two thousand were intubated to give you a basis of comparison new york state the entire state has 50 thousand hospital beds and about three thousand critical care beds and about 20 thousand of those beds are in new york city so if we have a wuhan style outbreak in new york city that s going to overwhelm the system so they need to be building surge capacity right now in anticipation of that possibility now there s ways to avert it but that s the risk that we face right now margaret brennan tens of thousands dr gottlieb we ll certain we ll hit we ll certainly hit tens of thousands of cases in the u s hopefully we won t hit hundreds of thousands of cases but right now if you look at some of the good research out of the hutch by trevor bedford and others they re they re saying that there s probably 10 to 40 thousand cases right now distributed across the u s i think the risk that we have in the u s is we re a much more mobile population china was able to confine their out their epidemic largely to wuhan the risk here is that we have multiple cities that are seeded right now and so we ll have multiple wuhans that s the bad case scenario margaret brennan multiple wuhans is an incredible thing to say the pentagon came out and put travel restrictions on u s troops traveling domestically they can do something like that dr gottlieb right margaret brennan do you expect to see other government agencies and should americans be expected to essentially be on lockdown dr gottlieb look there s no question that the steps we re taking right now or is changing the course of this epidemic we re already impacting this but i think we need to do much more and so think steps like banning government employees from nonessential travel or state employees that will have an additional impact we need to be doing all of these things leaning very hard into this the best case scenario is we look back a month from now and we say to ourselves well we overreacted you want to be in a position and dr fauci made this point as well you want to be in a position to say we we we overreacted it wasn t as bad as we thought it was going to be but this is a once in a generation pathogen we have never seen anything like this before in modern times this is gonna this is gonna be historic right now margaret brennan so should cities like seattle and new rochelle that are hot spots be on lockdown dr gottlieb i don t think we can quarantine a u s city and lock it down and deny people their liberty in this country i think what we can do is slow economic activity to a point where people have no place to go if you close the theaters and you close the restaurants you close large gatherings you tell people not to have dinner parties you tell businesses to have nonessential workers telework people stay home there s no place to go i think that s the solution in the united states not to not to put a city on lockdown i don t think we re going to get there we might i hope not margaret brennan is a is what new york state doing a model for the rest of the country dr gottlieb i think andrew cuomo has been leading very far ahead i think he s been very aggressive in doing a good job i m concerned that the city hasn t closed public schools private schools are closed public schools are not margaret brennan yeah dr gottlieb and you do start to worry that people s ability to protect themselves is going to break along socioeconomic lines where lower income americans will not have the same opportunities that middle wage and higher wage earners will because they can telework they send their kids to private school they re in suburban districts that closed margaret brennan right dr gottlieb that s got to be a concern margaret brennan and we will talk about that ahead with with larry kudlow and others but i want to take a quick break and come back on the health risks more conversation with dr scott gottlieb and some of your questions answered ahead stay with us commercial break margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we are back now with more from the former head of the fda dr scott gottlieb and then we will take a look at the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis as lives across this country have changed in the course of this week doctor we were talking about hospitals being basically able to help people if they get the virus or anything else are they going to be overwhelmed we are starting to see things like pictures of tents set up outside of hospitals is that something other hospitals should be doing either isolating or changing triage or is this about simply not having enough beds dr gottlieb well hospitals have emergency protocols and they re implementing those right now and that s very prudent trying to build facilities to offload some of that capacity from the hospital onto other sites so that ers don t get overrun we have about a million hospital beds in this country about 100 000 are critical care beds 50 000 of those in medical intensive care unit beds at any one time most of those icu beds are filled and hospitals are about 78 70 percent occupied so we don t have a lot of excess capacity we also don t have a lot of capacity with excess respirators there is about 60 000 full featured respirators in the country about 8 900 in stockpile so if we do have multiple epidemics in multiple large u s cities the system will become overwhelmed i think we can handle a a wuhan in one major u s city and pulse resources into that what i worry about again is multiple cities having that kind of an outbreak margaret brennan because if you don t have enough ventilators or other equipment doctors have to start making choices about who gets what dr gottlieb unfortunately there s about margaret brennan how do you do that dr gottlieb there s about 100 000 other ventilators that aren t full featured ventilators but could be used in a pinch and so what we need to do is try to free up capacity right now and that s what you see hospitals doing and that s what they re doing with these tents and these surge facilities they need to start discharging patients where they can not doing elective procedures so they re not bringing in patients these are hard economic decisions for the hospitals but this is absolutely what they have to be doing and we have time to do it we we do have three or four weeks if we re going to be on that trajectory that china was on to build that surge capacity right now china did just about everything wrong leading into their lockdown and they still were able to get control of their their epidemic there we do have an opportunity now but every day counts every day matters margaret brennan is the white house listening to you the president mentioned you by name this week dr gottlieb look i ve had i ve been fortunate to have the opportunity to talk to officials in the white house all through this some some of the calls that i was making and the conversations i was having go back to january they ve been on top of this i mean they ve been concerned about this i ve been talking to white house staff and the staff has been concerned about this and so i m going to continue to try to provide whatever help i can
