the record 3 3 million jobless claims reported thursday mark the beginning of an economic crisis facing american workers and businesses a slump experts say that will only end when the coronavirus pandemic is contained the economy has entered a deep recession that has echoes of the great depression in the way it has devastated so many businesses and consumers triggering mass layoffs and threatening to set off a chain reaction of bankruptcies and financial losses for companies large and small what sets this downturn apart is how rapidly the virus and the economic pain have spread it remains a wide open question whether this will become a long lasting slump or a short lived flash recession poll finds recession fears high amid layoffs and pay cuts from coronavirus fallout economists say the jobless claims reported thursday which reflected workers seeking unemployment insurance last week is the start of a massive spike in unemployment that could result in over 40 million americans losing their jobs by mid april although no official figures exist yet the unemployment rate has likely jumped to at least 5 5 percent says economist martha gimbel of schmidt futures a level not seen since 2015 and up from 3 5 percent in february the most terrifying part about this is this is likely just the beginning of the layoffs gimbel said sign up for our coronavirus updates newsletter to track the outbreak all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access that carnage is only likely to be partially ameliorated by a 2 2 trillion stimulus bill that the senate passed late wednesday evening and the house is aiming to approve friday the bill which gives most americans checks worth 1 200 or more and provides billions in low cost loans to businesses is likely to provide a lifeline to workers and companies facing devastation but it won t stop a severe recession nor be adequate to sustain workers if the coronavirus health crisis lasts more than a month or two we all think of a recession as having an economic underpinning but this has nothing to do with economics this is literally about trying to stay away from people said aparna mathur a scholar at the american enterprise institute much of the nation has made the gut wrenching choice to stop about half the economy and encourage most workers to stay home in an effort to save as many lives as possible

typical weekly paycheck in the united states the amount is slated to rise an additional 600 a week once president trump signs the relief bill into law a substantial increase meant to tide workers over

canceling at the last minute supplies from asia have dried up and sometimes deliveries can t be made from suppliers or to his customers as trucking companies don t have enough healthy drivers or capacity the covid 19 thing has really thrown a wrench in us sideways we re not one of those companies that has a lot of cash reserves dehenau said we re day by day here it s a lot of restless nights dehenau tried to apply for a small business administration loan this week but the site was so busy he only managed to get a login created before it froze so far he s only had to lay off one of his 30

of whether the downturn is turning into something that will be difficult to bounce back from the cheesecake factory has stopped paying rent on all its properties across the nation and many business owners say they might do the same because government aid likely won t arrive in time for april 1 payments commercial real estate stocks are down as much as 60 percent this year another warning sign is companies starting to slash pay occidental petroleum is cutting all u s worker salaries by 30 percent and many smaller businesses say they are considering something similar figuring it is better than layoffs these pay reductions are another way this crisis is rapidly changing the economy s trajectory after years of steady gains and likely making it harder for people to bounce right back to their prior spending levels even if they kept their job next week and the following week s unemployment claims numbers are also likely to be telling while 3 3 million new benefit applications last week was a shocking figure it only represents a fraction of the number of people whose jobs have been cut in this flash recession so far pam massey a hairdresser in gig harbor wash hasn t cut anyone s hair since march 13 her income has disappeared but she has not been able to apply for her state s unemployment benefits because she is technically self employed gig workers self employed and people who have only worked for a few months typically aren t eligible to get jobless aid from the government the senate bill greatly expands who can receive benefits to include self employed workers like massey but she has already lost half a month of income and she has to wait for the house to pass the bill and her state to implement the change i worried about my mortgage i m trying to get ready for retirement this is going to kill it massey said but if we don t stop the virus now it will continue for god only knows how long let s take the suffering upfront trump has debated trying to reopen
