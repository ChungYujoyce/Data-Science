jeb bush got his way and then he got a firestorm share the deciders jeb bush was pacing onstage at the conservative political action conference last year the former florida governor boasted that he had wiped out affirmative action with the stroke of his gubernatorial pen i eliminated affirmative action by executive order trust me there were a lot of people upset about this he told the crowd but through hard work we ended up having a system where there were more african american and hispanic kids attending our university system than prior to the system that was discriminatory above jeb bush speaks at scott brown s no bs bbq in rye n h in early november charles ommanney the washington post but his 1999 decision to eliminate affirmative action was not nearly as clear and simple as he makes it sound today and neither are its results instead bush was making a complicated political play under significant time pressure jeb bush nothing reveals more about politicians than the decisions they make why they chose to do something how they made it happen what came of it in the days before the first votes are cast in iowa and new hampshire the washington post is exploring one key choice by each leading presidential candidate and explain the insight it offers into the way he or she might operate in the white house more in this series ben carson from inspiring to polarizing john kasich

trump remade by reality tv ted cruz ambition enough for two hillary clinton a tough call on libya that still haunts bernie sanders his most radical move those who know him well say his actions on a divisive high stakes issue are emblematic of his style hard charging daring but with little patience for opposing points of view on affirmative action bush was not just burnishing his conservative credentials by abolishing what he called stupid and discriminatory race based set asides in florida s higher education system and government contracting sphere he also was trying to preserve a pipeline to education and employment opportunities for minorities that would he promised actually improve their access to college and state contracts and perhaps just as importantly he was attempting to block california based activist ward connerly from putting an affirmative action referendum on the november 2000 florida ballot that same ballot would it was widely presumed feature george w bush as the republican nominee for president florida was a crucial swing state the connerly referendum would probably bring out droves of african american overwhelmingly democratic voters who would oppose the measure and most likely vote against his big brother jeb bush decided he couldn t let any of that happen florida gov jeb bush speaks to the media 1999 in tallahassee after signing an executive order ending the consideration of race and ethnicity as factors in university admissions and barring racial set asides in state contracting decisions michael burchfield ap on the afternoon of jan 20 1999 connerly strode into the florida governor s office connerly had made himself into a political lighting rod known across the nation as the black man who wanted to end affirmative action a wealthy conservative republican and member of the california board of regents he had pushed through contentious affirmative action referendum measures that passed in california in 1996 and washington state in 1998 now he wanted to do the same thing in florida one of the country s most diverse states but 30 seconds into his sit down with a fellow wealthy conservative republican connerly discovered that he and the governor did not share the same agenda he d already made up his mind and we were just going through the motions connerly said in a recent interview he was very civil very polite but he made it clear he would be an obstacle to us i had no doubt he was concerned with the impending presidential election bush like a number of principal players in the ensuing drama declined numerous opportunities to comment for this article but sally bradshaw bush s chief of staff at the time and now a senior adviser to his presidential campaign calls connerly s oft repeated view cynical connerly picked florida and that election cycle once he did bush had to act or watch assistance to his state s minorities almost certainly be wiped out connerly s proposed referendum was favored 2 to 1 in polls she noted i remember a lot of conversations about how to respond to connerly and how to increase opportunity for minorities and in particular children facing poverty bradshaw said i never once remember a conversation driven by the fact that his brother might run for president at the time bush bashed connerly he wants a war bush told reporters i m a lover i can t imagine doing what he s talking about the governor then dropped the issue publicly he had made education reform a key issue of his 1998 campaign school vouchers were huge but affirmative action was nowhere on the radar screen but privately he directed top aides to quickly create an alternative to affirmative action if they could put one in place fast enough they could render connerly s proposed referendum moot bush was in perfect political position to do so republicans controlled the state house and senate and democrats were deeply opposed to connerly too this afforded him the opportunity to build bipartisan consensus on a volatile issue and unite the state against an outside activist that was not how bush worked he wanted to reshape the state in a hurry and not just on affirmative action he liked to talk about his big hairy audacious goals on school vouchers on the everglades on faith based prisons conservative hurricane is the title of one book that chronicles his administration he wasn t looking to tinker around the edges but to fundamentally change the way government worked said cory tilley bush s former deputy chief of staff in this case the governor was looking to avoid a very divisive fight for the state and declare a great new policy for minorities that worked in a modern sensible way les miller leader of the democrats in the state house and senate when bush was in office said he and his party colleagues found him brusque and often inflexible it was his way or the highway miller said i met with him one on one for about two minutes right after he was elected and that was it with a republican controlled house and senate democrats had no relevancy whatsoever miller said adding he was like i don t have to talk to you guys bush dubbed his proposal to end affirmative action one florida a call to unite the state but it was clear he expected florida to unite around him florida gov jeb bush sits with state lawmakers in january 2000 to negotiate a deal to end a sit in staged by members of the legislative black caucus at the governor s offices mark foley ap the one florida plan was developed by key bush staffers they consulted with 35 to 40 leaders throughout the state many of them minorities but most already in agreement with bush politically adam herbert a black republican who served as the chancellor of the state university system of florida helped pen the new university admissions policy t willard fair a civil rights era activist and president of the urban league of greater miami also provided feedback fair a political independent had teamed with bush the previous year to open the state s first charter school in miami s liberty city the resulting educational component was known as talented twenty and based on a program that george w bush had launched as governor of texas it guaranteed admission to a state university for students who finished in the top 20percent of their high school class as long as they had the necessary credit hours while race would no longer be taken into consideration socioeconomic status disability geography would factor into admissions criteria along with whether students were the first in their families to attend college the new business program aimed at minorities was developed and overseen by frank jimenez a deputy chief of staff the existing model was badly broken with just 1percent of state business going to minorities here the plan was to streamline the process for companies to register as minority owned loopholes that had been allowing state agencies to omit huge contracts from consideration were closed workshops would be held to introduce state procurement officers to the heads of businesses owned by minorities and women directors of state agencies were accountable to the governor for results once the new initiatives were prepared bush s staff reached out to state sen daryl jones a democrat who chaired the florida conference of black state legislators they wanted him to lead a 17 member task force to implement the plan i sat in daryl jones s living room before the rollout and he enthusiastically agreed to chair the task force said jimenez now general counsel at raytheon bush s decision to ignore the other democratic lawmakers who represented the vast majority of black floridians was not an oversight said john mckager stipanovich a prominent tallahassee lobbyist longtime bush friend and former campaign consultant he wasn t disdainful but every year the black caucus wants to meet with the governor stipanovich said doesn t matter what it s about they want a meeting then they ll come out of the meeting and say the governor is an idiot he just decided to skip that part on nov 9 1999 10 months after bush showed connerly the door and one year before the presidential ballot the governor stepped in front of an illuminated backdrop with a silhouette of the state map filled with black brown and white faces and emblazoned with the words one florida initiative this is a statement of inclusion not division bush said extolling the virtues of executive order 99 281 the use of racial and gender set asides preferences and quotas is considered divisive and unfair by the vast majority of floridians read the order jones who declined to be interviewed for this article was effusive i want them implemented quickly and effectively he told reporters of bush s new initiatives i want to support those efforts the policy needed only an approving vote from the board of regents and funding from the legislature to support scholarships media coverage was positive if cautious an important even bold step to advance the goal of equal opportunity editorialized the miami herald which called it a worthy idea but the triumphant rollout quickly gave way to a fierce political backlash the state s black caucus incensed with jones for not consulting with it threatened a coup backpedaling jones quit the task force seven days after the news conference bush sent him an intemperate public letter saying that his resignation was based on nothing more than political considerations and that critical comments he made about the executive order served to cheapen the public discourse on such an important topic the governor feeling burned aides say then refused to meet with two black state legislators sen kendrick meek son of then u s rep carrie meek an influential florida democrat who had fought for integration and rep anthony hill on jan 18 with the board of regents vote approaching meek and hill were talking with lt gov frank brogan in his office as meek and hill have told it bush whose offices were in the same suite passed by and snapped that they better get a blanket if they were waiting on him to change his mind setting off a impromptu sit in state rep larcenia bullard d miami leads legislators in verses of we shall overcome outside the governor s suite in tallahassee during the 2000 sit in mark foley ap bradshaw remembers the pair staging the sit in before bush even knew it was happening i ve always believed it was completely pre arranged a political stunt whatever the origin hill and meek called reporters who came running suddenly there were a dozen uninvited people in the governor s suite at 9 p m saying they weren t going to leave at first it was are you kidding me tilley said and then there was some real anger after several hours had passed bush not realizing there was a film crew in the open area of the governor s office angrily told press spokesman justin sayfie to kick their asses out that lightning bolt shot across state television screens that night sayfie says bush was talking only about the reporters but that wasn t at all clear that night and the governor s do it my way tactics had backfired thousands march on the florida statehouse in tallahassee in march 2000 protesting gov jeb bush s plan to end affirmative action in the state phil coale ap a public relations debacle said the st petersburg times the next day after reporters and legislators had slept in the small office bush called the sit in sophomoric but agreed to postpone the impending board of regents vote to set up public meetings in tampa miami and tallahassee i m asking for a critique of our plan bush told reporters and suggestions for how to make it better that evening answering an email from a supporter he wrote my main objective is to ensure that we end discriminatory practices like set asides and quotas and race based admissions criteria while we actively embrace diversity all the while to reporters he was more blunt the two most miserable days of my life floridians mostly black and mostly furious came out in droves to the hearings in tampa the hearing went for seven hours and dozens of people who signed up to speak were still left waiting when bush showed up at the miami hearing he was lambasted for three hours he met privately for an hour with a group of influential black pastors then with students from florida a m few if any were swayed i knew there was a high risk nature to this he told then miami herald reporter steve bousquet but this is the right thing to do and i have been elected i think to do what i think is right in march when he delivered his state of the state address to the legislature the governor who wanted to avoid divisiveness arrived to see that he had set off one of the largest protests in florida history more than 10 000 floridians most of them black rallying against him no more bush they chanted jeb crow read signs inside bush spoke for half an hour he never mentioned the protesters but he told legislators that the vast majority of floridians favor the elimination of all affirmative action programs republican presidential candidate jeb bush speaks to children at the founders academy in manchester n h in early november charles ommanney the washington post bush may not have united florida behind him but he never wavered he ll make his decision stick his face in there and stick with what he thinks is right stipanovich says and he won the board of regents approved one florida the legislature approved the scholarships connerly s proposed referendum got stuck in the courts and was eventually dropped the november 2000 presidential election one of the most disputed in american history was ultimately settled in florida george w bush was declared the winner by 537 votes among nearly 6million cast in the state sixteen years later one florida has had mixed results for the state s minorities african americans were about 18 percent of the freshman class at all state universities and colleges before the program roughly in line with their percentage of the overall population today african americans account for 21 percent of the state s population but just 13 percent of the state s freshman collegiate class those classifying themselves as hispanic accounted for 15percent of the population in 2000 now after population growth and a change in census counting metrics they make up 28percent of the state s residents the percentage of hispanic college freshmen has rocketed from about 11 percent in 2000 at the time of one florida to 27percent the minority business program tripled the percentage of state contracts to minorities during bush s first term but since he left office figures have receded to pre bush levels reports show today the bold move to act via executive order is not something bush finds admirable in the current occupant of the white house at that same cpac event where he touted using an executive order to end affirmative action he blasted obama for using his executive power to try to carry out his agenda when announcing his campaign he said he would pass meaningful immigration reform not by executive order still bush retains the belief that as the chief elected executive the shots are his to call at a summer campaign stop in new hampshire bush echoed a phrase his brother made famous about the role of the president a president is a decider he told his audience a president leads by making decisions many of them are tough and he promised he won t flinch bush formally kicks off his white house run in june at miami
