trump is sticking to his claim that he s done nothing wrong president donald trump it s all about the transcript they ve having people i ve never even heard of some of these people i don t know who they are margaret brennan republicans put out their own wish list of witnesses including the whistleblower and hunter biden but they re having a tougher time coming up with a line of defense for mister trump woman 1 hold on we have mark meadows right here congressman meadows can we talk so he he s walking by right now but republicans are really struggling to defend the president okay great mark meadows i m not struggling on anything woman 1 okay so congressman representative mark meadows so the republicans are not struggling on anything margaret brennan here s the president s top ally in the senate lindsey graham senator lindsey graham what i can tell you about the trump policy toward the ukraine it was incoherent it depends on who you talk to they seem to be incapable of forming a quid pro quo margaret brennan and this from louisiana senator john kennedy senator john kennedy in terms of the quid pro quo there are perfectly appropriate quid pro quos and there are inappropriate prid quid pro quos margaret brennan we ll talk with senator kennedy as well as a democrat from the house intelligence committee california s eric swalwell there is another big event in washington wednesday turkey s president erdogan will visit the white house we ll talk with the new national security advisor robert o brien plus former new york mayor michael bloomberg is exploring a

sorry you ain t going to buy this election margaret brennan nor the democratic primary voters are convinced man have you heard about michael bloomberg possibly entering woman 2 yes i m just just appalled and i think he was a republican at one time and then turned democrat margaret brennan all that plus analysis on news of the week is just ahead on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation it s a big week here in washington so we want to get quickly to our very first guest republican senator john kennedy who joins us this morning from kenner louisiana good morning senator congrats on the big win senator john kennedy r louisiana senjohnkennedy judiciary committee thank you margaret it was a great game i m proud for our of our youngsters but alabama played a great game too margaret brennan very generous of you there i want to quickly get to the issue at hand you heard senator john kennedy well no i meant it actually i meant it margaret brennan i m glad in our show open you heard a quote from yourself talking about what is appropriate senator john kennedy mm hm margaret brennan and inappropriate in terms of quid pro quos if a quid pro quo was shown to be for the president s own political benefit is that appropriate senator john kennedy the the quid pro quo in my judgment is a red herring here here are the two possible scenarios number one the president asked for an investigation of a political rival number two the president asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival the latter would be in the national interest the former would be in the president s parochial interests and would be over the line i think this case is going to come down to the president s intent his motive did he have a culpable state of mind for me margaret there are only two relevant questions that need to be answered why did the president ask for an investigation margaret brennan mm hm senator john kennedy and number two and this is inextricably linked to the first question what did mister hunter biden do for the money margaret brennan well i want to ask you now there have been more than twenty five hundred pages of sworn testimony that have been released to the public have you read any of those depositions senator john kennedy mm hm i ve read some but any lawyer in my judgment who knows a law book from a j crew catalog knows that a a sterile transcript is no substitute for live witnesses margaret brennan okay senator john kennedy and i thought margaret brennan well i want to senator john kennedy i thought margaret brennan ask you specific senator john kennedy speaker pelosi margaret brennan so i just want to ask you specifically because of the point you re making senator john kennedy mm hm margaret brennan in terms of differentiating intent motive and culpable state of mind lieutenant colonel vindman a decorated army officer who gave sworn testimony it was released this week he currently works at senator john kennedy uh huh margaret brennan the white house listened to president trump s call senator john kennedy right margaret brennan with the ukrainian president and he testified quote there was no doubt that the president was seeking political investigations of political rivals senator john kennedy mm hm margaret brennan so is it appropriate to ask foreign governments to investigate americans senator john kennedy well it depends on the circumstances i m not going to go through the two scenarios that i just gave you but it depends on the circumstances and there is there i would say this about the transcript i can comment on the gentleman s testimony if you let me hear his live testimony let me hear the cross examination let me judge his credibility let me judge his body language and also allow the opposing party to call their own witnesses and rebuttal that s that s due process margaret brennan mm hm senator john kennedy not to not only allowing the witnesses you want as the chairman has done and then leaking selective portions of it to friendly members of the media who lap it up like a puppy margaret brennan well all the depositions that that i m quoting from are now publicly released so it was senator john kennedy now they are margaret brennan the government that released them right senator john kennedy but before when they were trying but before when they were trying to to establish the narrative with the american people they were selectively leaking and and that s what matters margaret brennan well now we re moving into public senator john kennedy here margaret what are the american margaret brennan right well now the case has got to be made to the american public senator john kennedy i m sorry margaret brennan now the case has to be made to the american public in these public hearings so is there anything that you could hear from lieutenant colonel vindman if and when he was called to testify that would lead you to ever vote for the removal of the president senator john kennedy well again i ve got to hear i ve got to hear the testimony you margaret brennan so that means maybe senator john kennedy you you if you want to if you if you assert if you try to assess how a trial is going for our for our defendant you don t just listen to the lawyers opening statements and you don t just read the transcript you sit there and listen to all the testimony the cross examination and the context margaret brennan mm hm senator john kennedy and i i think i think that that speaker pelosi s decision and adam schiff s decision to prevent the republicans from calling their own witnesses in the live testimony is just doubling down on stupid the american people i think are going look at this and go i get it margaret brennan mm hm senator john kennedy they are going to give the president a fair and impartial firing squad margaret brennan so you re not senator john kennedy and and that s not due process margaret brennan but you re not suggesting here that the witnesses like lieutenant colonel vindman lack credibility senator john kennedy i don t know i can t i wasn t allowed to hear them margaret brennan well senator john kennedy what i am telling you is that if it can be demonstrated that the president asked for and and had the requisite state of mind that the president asked for an investigation of a political rival that s over the line margaret brennan okay senator john kennedy but if he asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival that s not over the line margaret brennan so over the line does that mean impeachable senator john kennedy yeah probably margaret brennan so there is something you could hear senator john kennedy but again margaret brennan that could potentially persuade you to vote for removal senator john kennedy what i can t answer that margaret because that that that that encompasses all possible scenarios that s like asking me if i didn t go fishing saturday how many fish will i have caught all i m saying is that that that it ought to be fair it ought to be public i read somewhere that democracy dies in darkness it ought to be public both sides ought to be called able to call their witnesses in front of god and country and the american people margaret brennan mm hm senator john kennedy and then let the american people decide and and the president and his counsel should be allowed to participate now i think that would be fair and then i i will happily judge the evidence but you can t limit the witnesses as margaret brennan mm hm senator john kennedy chairman schiff and speaker pelosi s are doing selectively leaked portions of the margaret brennan right senator john kennedy transcript that favor your opinion to friendly members of the press who lap it up like a puppy margaret brennan well senator john kennedy i don t think any fair minded person in the milky way believes that speaker pelosi margaret brennan mm hm senator john kennedy or chairman schiff are impartial here margaret brennan well senator john kennedy so but they can margaret brennan we look forward to the trial senator john kennedy at least follow due process margaret brennan we look forward to the trial in the senate and then seeing what you decide to do senator thank you for joining us the question is of course with our next guest the assumption democratic congressman eric swalwell joins us now is that when it goes from your committee from these hearings were about to begin before house intelligence that there will be articles of impeachment voted on that will pass the democratic controlled house and then end up in the other side of the court in front of senator kennedy there there will be thirteen democrats nine republicans who get to ask questions in this next round of three diplomats in the coming days what is going to be different about this i mean yeah cameras are in the room but is this just show representative eric swalwell d california repswalwell intelligence committee good morning margaret it s important that the president has due process and evidence is not a conclusion we have enough evidence from the depositions that we ve done to warrant bringing this forward evidence of an extortion scheme using taxpayer dollars to ask a foreign government to investigate the president s opponent but it s important that these witnesses raise their right hands and take questions from both republicans and democrats the president is going to get that it s important that the republicans be afforded the opportunity to suggest witnesses that we should call and that we determine whether that is relevant that that you know the facts are just as important margaret brennan right representative eric swalwell as the process behind the facts as far as what if anything goes over to the senate margaret brennan but do you expect anything new from these testimonies or is it going to be a recitation of what we can read in these depositions already representative eric swalwell these witnesses have been fairly consistent and for the most part they ve not been coordinating or talking to each other but again this is america and we don t just have you know railroading of justice these witnesses you know should come public margaret brennan mm hm representative eric swalwell and you know the american people should judge for themselves as well as we will as to you know what happened here margaret brennan well on the issue of witnesses that senator kennedy was talking about the the republican party put forward yesterday a list of suggested witnesses they would like to see called on there hunter biden and his business partner is it safe to say they will never come before the house intelligence committee representative eric swalwell well as chairman schiff has said we re not going to go back in time and revisit conspiracy theories that are implicated in the president s call and you know it was said former secretary of homeland security tom bossert who told jake tapper a couple of weeks ago that he was telling the president that much of what the president alleged in that phone call to president zelensky about the ukrainians involved margaret brennan mm hm representative eric swalwell in 2016 was just nonsense and so we don t want to revisit conspiracy theories if people have relevant information to this investigation and the president s conduct of course we want to hear from them margaret brennan so that s no to the bidens representative eric swalwell i ll leave that to the chairman margaret brennan okay representative eric swalwell i don t see any relevancy with the bidens there s no evidence that any anything improper has happened and witnesses have been asked about the bidens and said that vice president biden in every way margaret brennan mm hm representative eric swalwell these witnesses in the way they worked with him conducted himself with integrity margaret brennan one member of the national security council tim morrison was on the republican list kurt volker the former u s envoy to ukraine is it safe to assume they will be before your committee representative eric swalwell you know we re going to handle that this week you know taking up the republican witness list and we re going to be fair about it because again the fairness behind the process is just as important as the facts margaret brennan you wrote talking about the fairness of the process one of the things that gets criticized by republicans of democrats is that the outcome s presupposed representative eric swalwell yeah margaret brennan and if you just look back at your own record representative eric swalwell yeah margaret brennan back to the spring you were calling for impeachment you wrote an op ed in june calling for impeachment that was before this whistleblower ever came to light representative eric swalwell you know what s interesting about margaret brennan so how can that look fair representative eric swalwell yeah margaret brennan how can that be fair representative eric swalwell you know what s interesting about the op ed i wrote i wrote it in response to the president s interview with george stephanopoulos where he said if he was offered again dirt on a political opponent from a foreign power he would again take it i didn t know when i wrote that op ed that he was already engaging in this manner with the ukrainians but his prior conduct with the russians suggested that he might do that which is why i thought at that time we have an upcoming election we want it to be pure and one that is above you know any questions and this president you know needs to be held accountable for his actions margaret brennan national former national security adviser john bolton he has not been subpoenaed he s deferring to a court to sort of decide who he needs to listen to the the white house tells him not to comply or congress who has asked him to come and answer questions why don t you think you need to hear from him why can t you wait until december until a court would decide representative eric swalwell we d like to hear from him but we ve heard from three of his deputies who have provided consistent testimony about what was going on in this shakedown scheme we ve asked him to come in but the white house has told him not to come in and we re not going to chase witnesses to the courts because even if a court ruled in december that he has to come in it would be it will be appealed to a circuit court of appeals margaret brennan mm hm representative eric swalwell and then ultimately up to the supreme court we don t have time with an upcoming election that potentially could be compromised by the president s conduct we need to you know move expeditiously but fairly on what we have now margaret brennan but why expeditiously why can t you just wait a few weeks representative eric swalwell well it s not a few weeks it could be all the way up to a year and we see this as a tactic by the administration to obstruct our investigation we also believe if the president believed that john bolton or mick mulvaney could offer testimony that would show that he s innocent he would send them in on horses to our committee to testify they can t which is the reason we believe he s obstructing which goes to a consciousness of guilt margaret brennan the house republicans have sort of reshuffled their deck ahead of these hearings and added congressman jim jordan to the committee and i m wondering what you think that will do to these public hearing this week i mean what will this change representative eric swalwell you know they they could put johnnie cochran on their side to ask questions it s not going to change the facts of this case now if there are going to be stunts you re going to see again those stunts will be used by the american people against them to show a consciousness of guilt and a lack of seriousness i think this is a very serious investigation this is an opportunity for my republican colleagues to reset and recognize also they re not the public defenders for the president they don t have to defend him at all costs they can actually approach this objectively give him a fair process ask the right questions and then make a judgment on the facts but this is not a time for stunts margaret brennan i want to ask you you had been a presidential race contender for 2020 we saw michael bloomberg say he may jump into the race isn t officially declared what do you think that does to the lineup representative eric swalwell it gives the voters more options but look i i think options are good and whoever emerges from this will be battle tested it s going to flush out weaknesses this large field and whoever emerges is going to be a very strong candidate to take on and defeat donald trump if he s their nominee next year margaret brennan all right so thank you very much representative eric swalwell my pleasure margaret brennan we ll be back in one minute with the new national security adviser to president trump the master robert o brien stay with us it s just ahead announcements margaret brennan this week turkey s president will be welcomed at the white house it will be the first meeting since turkey defied the u s by invading syria and president trump abruptly ordered american troops out of that country since then president trump has reversed course deciding to keep some seven hundred troops on the ground there down from a total of twelve hundred in all of syria cbs news foreign correspondent charlie d agata is in northeast syria with an update on their mission begin vt charlie d agata cbs news foreign correspondent u s troops on patrol here today making their presence known in this region as we have watched them repositioning around oil facilities their reach is nearing what it was before president trump s order to withdraw last month right beside their allies the kurdish led syrian democratic forces in the ongoing fight against isis and while some may argue it s time to bring the troops home top kurdish commander mazloum kobani told us not just yet what is your message to them mazloum kobani speaking foreign language charlie d agata with the americans we started a project together we are partners he said once this job is done they can leave we don t want the americans to stay here for four hundred years but it is a job that has become much harder in this carved up and congested region we saw kurdish protestors pelt a joint turkish russian convoy passing right through the same territory controlled today by u s forces turkey and kurdish forces have accused each other of cease fire violations and complicating matters further the syrian regime has clashed with turkish troops none of this would have happened had president trump not given turkey the green light to launch its assault on the kurds in the first place can america ever repair the damaged that s been done mazloum kobani speaking foreign language charlie d agata general kobani said if the americans break their promise again the trust will be gone forever end vt charlie d agata from the top down ask anybody here whether they can now trust president trump and they ll say it s not like we have any choice this volatile region is now on a knife edge as turkey s president heads to washington this week margaret brennan that s our charlie d agata reporting from northeast syria joining us now to weigh in on syria and more is the president s national security adviser robert o brien good morning to you mister ambassador robert o brien national security adviser good morning margaret margaret brennan you just heard charlie lay out a very complicated landscape diplomacy means talking to your friends and to your enemies having difficult conversations but you just heard everything charlie laid out i mean erdogan defied the united states by invading syria he s buying russian made weapons he s doing everything you re telling him not to why is he getting rewarded for bad behavior robert o brien well let me just point out margaret that that you got it right and unfortunately charlie got it wrong when charlie said we green lighted the invasion of syria of syria that s just absolutely false it didn t happen margaret brennan well the u s moved troops robert o brien the president the president margaret brennan out of the way robert o brien well the president made it very clear that that turkey shouldn t go in he even said if you go in i may have to obliterate your economy he did it on twitter he did it on on the phone he did it in a letter that was a very strongly worded letter so the so the idea that the u s somehow green lighted turkey s military operation that s that s just simply false and and the american people shouldn t shouldn t believe that now what he did do we had twenty eight green berets who were at a forward operating post on the border that would have been caught in a crossfire between fifteen thousand turkish troops and armor and and seven or eight thousand ypg sdf troops and the president was not willing margaret brennan kurdish forces robert o brien kurdish forces margaret brennan that are allied with the u s robert o brien correct and the president was not going to leave those young men in in harm s way in a crossfire and so he pulled those those troops out because it s look it s ultimately it s it s the president who has to call the families it s the president who has to go to dover margaret brennan right robert o brien if something happens margaret brennan but that s why the question is relevant why reward that bad behavior this is a nato ally who is putting u s troops at risk who is putting u s allies at risk robert o brien well we re not rewarding the behavior the president promptly put on sanctions and margaret brennan and then he took them off robert o brien well he did because the turks agreed to a cease fire and and turkey said they wouldn t agree to a cease fire the president dispatched me and a number of top diplomats david satterfield jim jeffrey and then then dispatched the secretary of state and the vice president to ankara and in twenty four hours we had a cease fire and by the way that was a cease fire that the kurdish forces had a lot of input into we want we wanted to save lives we wanted to save turkish lives and keep in mind there were turkish civilians being killed and and rocketed by the kurds there were kurdish folks being killed including turkish soldiers we got a cease fire and and in a short amount of time we got those kurdish soldiers evacuated to to a safe area so i think the kurds appreciated the cease fire i think the turks did as well and that was a a real diplomatic coup from the president because he because of his tough line margaret brennan do you recognize that there were war crimes committed robert o brien look it some of the things that we ve seen are very disturbing and margaret brennan by turkey robert o brien well margaret brennan and turkish supported militias robert o brien maybe the turkish supported militias turkey has assured us that those are being investigated we re very concerned about those issues the war crimes issues we re watching them we re monitoring it very closely there is no place for genocide for ethnic cleansing for war crimes in the twenty first century the u s won t stand by for it and and we ve made that position very clear to the turks margaret brennan if congress passes any of the at least three sanctions bills on turkey that are going to get bipartisan support will the president veto all of them robert o brien look we ll have to see what what happens this week with our meetings with president erdogan i mean there are there are things that turkey s a member of nato turkey plays a very important geopolitical role for for our friends in europe for ourselves margaret brennan mm hm robert o brien they they sit astride the bosporus margaret brennan right robert o brien the strait that goes into the black sea we have nato allies romania and bulgaria that are black sea powers so so losing turkey as as an ally is not something that s good for the europe for europe or for the united states margaret brennan let s talk robert o brien and and we re going to we re going to work on making sure that margaret brennan yeah robert o brien we can do our very best to keep them as a as a nato member margaret brennan more to talk about your portfolio in a moment we have to take a break we ll be right back announcements man senator joseph r mccarthy republican of wisconsin faced the nation with correspondents across the country questioning him live from indianapolis new york city and also here in washington here is the moderator of face the nation ted koop ted koop how do you do and welcome to face the nation margaret brennan that was the very first episode of face the nation sixty five years ago this week and as you can see we had a couple of technical glitches right at the start technology has certainly changed but our commitment here at face the nation has not for sixty five years we ve done our best to give our viewers not only the news they need to know but to help educate and give them context about what s important and why in a fair straightforward way we ll have more thoughts on our mission here at face the nation over the years in our next half hour announcements margaret brennan some of our stations are leaving us now but we will be right back with more from ambassador o brien and our political panel so stay with us announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we continue our conversation with ambassador robert o brien national security adviser to president trump i i want to pick up on this idea where we left it with turkey coming and they are a nato ally as you emphasized one of our nato allies the french president emmanuel macron said this week that nato is suffering a brain death because of lack of american support and resolve from what he is seeing and then what we re seeing with turkey causing these cracks in the alliance i mean you must be very concerned is that why you ve brought the nato secretary general to the white house this week as well robert o brien well we have a nato summit coming up the third and fourth of december so we ll be in london for that summit i think i think it s going to be a good summit between nato allies nato s an important alliance to us but look i think the cracks of that have formed in the alliance are because we have members of the alliance that aren t paying their fair share that aren t spending money on defense i mean the the united states taxpayer and and the taxpayer of eight of the nato country taxpayers of eight of the nato countries that are spending their two percent on national defense we spend over four percent they re doing the right things but there are a bunch of countries including germany and others that that aren t paying their fair share it s not it s not right for the american taxpayer to have to defend these countries that don t want to defend themselves so so the president has been very very strong on this issue there s been a hundred billion dollars in new nato defense spending since he took office margaret brennan mm hm robert o brien it s a great accomplishment of president trump i think the americans are happy about it i think most europeans are happy about it margaret brennan well emmanuel macron was voicing out loud some real concerns and if you look at what turkey has done as you just described you thought that there was a potential nato ally would fire on the united states intentionally or not in syria you ve also seen turkey go ahead and buy russian made weapons in defiance of nato robert o brien yeah we re we re very upset about that and we ve made margaret brennan can can you get behind sanctions on them robert o brien well margaret brennan i mean they are supposed to be triggered by congress robert o brien well look look if if turkey doesn t get rid of the s 400 i mean there will likely be sanctions the caatsa sanctions will will pass congress with an overwhelming bipartisan majority and turkey will feel the impact of those sanctions we we ve made that very clear to president erdogan there s no place in nato for the s 400 there s no place in nato for significant russian military purchases that s a message that the president will deliver to him very clearly when he s here in washington margaret brennan i know you re just back from asia the president says he wants to meet with xi jinping and possibly get a trade deal by december is that a hard date on the calendar robert o brien look there there s no deadline we want to get a good deal and i think we re very close to getting a phase one trade deal and it will be the first time that we ve had a trade deal where china has actually respected the united states and and hasn t you know stole our intellectual property has been fair and reciprocal in trade so if we can get a good deal then we ll get a good deal i think we re very close and i think if there is a deal the president and president xi will will get together and sign it look we want great relations with china but this is the first president that stood up to china that that has been you know stealing american intellectual property not all american companies that have access to chinese markets engage in unfair trade practices that has to come to an end because the chinese have been using that to fill to to fund one of the most massive military buildups in history margaret brennan right robert o brien and and and you know that has to come to a stop margaret brennan well as i just said you re back from asia you ve been raising concerns about china s militarization particularly of the south china sea i mean this only seems to be escalating militarily robert o brien well i don t think it s escalating militarily i think the president has put tariffs on on china we ve always and and those tariffs have led the chinese to the negotiating table and i think we re going to get a pretty good deal for the american people especially for the american farmers for owners of intellectual property margaret brennan so so you see a trade deal going ahead and what you re talking about in terms of militarization in the south china sea that kind of thing is not going to complicate robert o brien look we re we re going to still stand up and i did at the asean summit at the east asia summit i made it very clear that that just because one country is big and other countries are small in the region the bigger countries shouldn t bully the smaller countries and and take their resources whether they are fishery resources or oil and gas resources and the u s navy will continue to have freedom of navigation operations through the south china sea this nine dash line or cow s tongue that the chinese have have margaret brennan mm hm robert o brien drawn around the entire south china sea which is a major swath of the pacific ocean and claimed it as internal waters as if it was lake tahoe or something that just can t stand the united states navy won t put up with it the the countries in the regions region won t put up with it and and all those countries with with very few exceptions were grateful because that america is standing up for them standing up for their resource patrimony that s the future for their kids and their grandkids with the oil and gas and the fisheries the minerals off their shores china shouldn t be allowed to take it just because they are bigger margaret brennan you on ukraine i know you were not at the white house when this july twenty fifth phone call happened that is now at the heart of this impeachment inquiry but you are now part of ukraine policymaking you heard senator graham at the top of the program say the policy is completely incoherent will the u s continue lethal military aid to ukraine until russia backs out of crimea and stops supporting separatists in ukraine robert o brien well look i think you put your finger on the most most important issue and that s lethal military aid i was in ukraine in 2014 i was there to observe the elections in ukraine i was there as part of a bipartisan election observation mission and i had young ukrainian soldiers and young ukrainians come up to me and say why won t the u s the arsenal of demo democracy send us lethal aid you re sending us blankets and mres why won t margaret brennan right robert o brien president obama send us military aid margaret brennan and president trump changed robert o brien and and there and there margaret brennan policy by doing that robert o brien and there was no military aid going to to the ukrainians under the the the obama biden administration margaret brennan mm hm robert o brien when president trump got into office he sent military aid so i think what people ought to be focusing on is the president has been helping the the ukrainians defend themselves by sending them lethal lethal military aid to stand up to the russians that s the real story that s been lost in all this margaret brennan but is the is the policy though that that that lethal aid will continue until russia stops backing separatists and and trying to annex parts of ukraine robert o brien well i m not going to get into hypotheticals about what could happen down the road i mean hopefully russia and ukraine can get along and there can be some sort of a peace treaty and and an agreement between them so i m not going to commit the united states to what we re going to do forever but but for right now we re set we re we re the first administration margaret brennan mm hm robert o brien president trump is the first president to send lethal military aid to ukraine i think it s very important and i think that s something that s been lost in in all the hullabaloo about the about the telephone call and one other thing i d say about this i ve been with president trump in two dozen conversations either in person or on the phone with foreign leaders and if the american people could be on those phone calls they d be extraordinarily proud of the president how he represents america the cordiality that he he has with world leaders margaret brennan mm hm robert o brien but also the tough message that he has to to protect u s interests i mean they d they d be proud of what their president does in those meetings with foreign leaders margaret brennan lieutenant colonel vindman who has testified under oath is serving on the national security council currently will he continue to work for you despite testifying against the president robert o brien well well look one of the things that i have talked about is that we re streamlining the national security council it got bloated to like two hundred and thirty six people from up from a hundred in the bush administration under president obama we re streamlining the national security council there are people that are detailed from different departments and agencies my understanding is he is is that colonel vindman is is detailed from the department of defense so everyone who s detailed at the nsc people are going to start going back to their own departments margaret brennan mm hm robert o brien and we ll bring in new folks but we re going to get that number down to around a hundred people that s what it was under condoleezza rice she came and met with me i met with a number of my successors margaret brennan right robert o brien we don t need to recreate the department of defense the department of state the department of homeland security over at the white house we ve got great diplomats and soldiers and and folks that can that do that work for us in the departments margaret brennan just to button that up though you re saying colonel lieutenant colonel vindman is scheduled to rotate out you are not suggesting in any way that there will be retaliation against him robert o brien i i i never retaliated against anyone so the the it s like margaret brennan but his time is coming to an end robert o brien there there will be a point for for everybody who s detailed there margaret brennan okay robert o brien that their time that their detail will come to an end they will go back to their agency and what we want them to do is take the experience and skills they learned at the white house take it back to their departments and agencies and and do an even better job there and and so we re we re grateful that we can have these detailees come in and they will come spend the year a year or you know maybe a little bit more at the white house margaret brennan mm hm robert o brien and then they will go back to their agency and and they will do a better job at their agency margaret brennan all right robert o brien having been at the white house margaret brennan thank you very much robert o brien thank you for having me margaret margaret brennan ambassador o brien for joining us appreciate it we ll be right back with our panel don t go away announcements margaret brennan we turn now to some political analysis from our panel stephen hayes is the editor of the dispatch and a fox news contributor margaret talev is the white house and politics editor at axios jeffrey goldberg is the editor in chief of the atlantic and antjuan seawright is a democratic strategist and cbs news contributor good to have you all here stephen hayes the dispatch stephenfhayes good to be here margaret brennan impeachment seems to be sucking the oxygen out of everything here in washington stephen i want to begin with you because i know you think that this is a bad week for republicans but you don t think outside the beltway this is resonating stephen hayes i don t i don t think it s really resonating if you look at the way that republicans in congress are reacting to this it s almost with a shrug off the shoulders we we saw these transcripts come out if you spent time reading the two thousand plus pages of the transcripts tremendously damaging to the argument that republicans have made for the past six weeks in defense of the president one by one by one you saw all of these defenses of the president on substances fall away where it s clear that there was this quid pro quo that democrats and others have been alleging republicans don t have an answer for it as i think was was evident in your interview with senator kennedy margaret brennan he said it depends on the kind of quid pro quo stephen hayes yeah but he he sketched out the scenario where he had on the one hand the the president might have been doing this because he had some vague interest in corruption broadly but you have to just take a step back and think about what that means i mean this is a president who has had friendly relations with leaders of tremendously corrupt countries where he was talking about egypt or russia or saudi arabia or turkey who wants to bring troops home who is an america firster but he suddenly had such an interest in corruption in this one country in ukraine that he sent his personal attorney to conduct investigations that happened to overlap coincidentally with the interests his political interests in in that they were investigating two of his chief political rivals it doesn t even pass the leftist margaret brennan so margaret why why then is that not more clear to the public if it is so clear as stephen laid out there is it that what these public hearings will change margaret talev axios margarettalev well the public hearings can only change people s minds of people who watch the public hearings and are engaged in them or read about them and i think it s pretty clear from the early weeks of this that that president trump s base is not shaken or thwarted by this and so really the issue is the group we re going to be hearing a lot about in the next several months which is the suburban voters right these are the you if you call them moderate voters or swing voters or suburban voters somewhere in that circle is is this group of people we saw the relevance of suburban voters in virginia in the elections perhaps to some extent in kentucky and this is the group that both democrats and president trump are now going to be fighting for because they are the people who are engaged in margaret brennan mm hm margaret talev you know in sort of the daily business that involves paying attention to more details like this and they are the people who are most likely to be at a workstation at work with the tv on absorbing the contents of this trying to figure out whether they are uncomfortable enough about it that they won t vote for president trump twice margaret brennan antjuan how do democrats avoid what happened with the robert mueller hearings where there was this big buildup and the idea that if he testifies publicly he will describe in vivid detail what people didn t bother to read in print well how is this going to be different antjuan seawright democratic strategist antjuansea cbs news contributor i think we have to first come to the real realization that donald trump and his disciples have no interest in having a relationship with the truth regardless of whether it is public or whether they actually read it and can see it number two i think democrats have to block and tackle block out this arguments or this distraction that the republicans want to draw them into and really tackle the issues that matter to the american people while they also pass legislation that they promised the american people in 2018 and remind people that is the senate is the holdup is the problem and everything goes mcconnell s graveyard to die if we fail to do that we will be sentenced again to two years in the hard time as the minority party margaret brennan do you think it s going well antjuan seawright i it s hard to say look here s what i do know the republicans demonstrated what i believe to be a political pump fake about transparency during this process when you have forty seven or forty eight members of their conference a part of these hearings now they re public and you have leaders like senator graham and others who want to press the ignore button on the fact they re going to be transparent and essentially are saying regardless of what comes out no matter who says it like a decorated military official it s not true because it s anti donald trump and we ve seen this movie before and that s why i think democrats have to stay focused on the things that matter outside of the bubble margaret brennan jeffrey who s actually winning on the messaging here and convincing the american public because that s what these public hearings are going to be focused on jeffrey goldberg the atlantic jeffreygoldberg i think it s actually this sounds very journalistic but i think it s too early to tell we don t know what dynamic we we enter when we actually see these people live in front of the cameras and how many people are watching and how convincing it is i mean on the one hand we ll know the answer to that question i think not so much i mean we ll know it when we see what people in the suburbs feel about it we ll also really know the answer if we see re republicans become less cohesive if there s one person one person with influence in the republican party on the hill who says you know what the emperor really doesn t have his clothes on margaret brennan mm hm jeffrey goldberg that could sort of break this open a little bit because all of us i think up here talk to republicans on the hill who privately say this is a disaster a moral disaster a political disaster an ethical disaster and they are just holding on and they re coming up with these talking points that margaret brennan mm hm jeffrey goldberg that you saw on your show today but there s a belief and maybe this is an overoptimistic belief in the part of trump s opponents that there are people there who will say enough is enough when they hear it from margaret brennan mm hm jeffrey goldberg as you say a decorated war veteran this is actually what happens when they hear it from from serious professionals in the state department they might just say enough antjuan seawright but margaret here s the one thing democrats and and republicans agree on margaret brennan mm hm antjuan seawright the interests of national security and i think if democrats use that as their north star or their foundation about this being about national security in the future of this country i think that is a point that no one can argue margaret brennan well in the meantime the the split screen will be these hearings happening on capitol hill while the president is meeting with another world leader that he is dealing with national security i i was pressing jeffrey the national security adviser on why turkey s leader deserves the honor of walking into the white house and after after listing all of the things that turkey has done wrong jeffrey goldberg right and and as you know there s a hope in washington that simply that erdogan leaves without having his bodyguards beat up people as happened the last time margaret brennan because that s what happened jeffrey goldberg we have lower standards for this visit than we usually have we re just like let s not not have street violence associated with this visit no this the the the reception of erdogan this week doesn t make any sense from a national security perspective are you rewarding remember we always talk about rewarding people with an oval office visits is this the person who deserves an oval office visit no of course not but nothing is particularly coherent in our national security strategy right now so it makes as much sense as anything else in this kind of topsy turvy world in which we live margaret brennan you were referring to in 2017 when american protesters were beaten up there are u s marshals arrest warrants jeffrey goldberg right margaret brennan out for some of turkey s erdogan s bodyguards jeffrey goldberg right margaret brennan we ll see if they show up on this visit we ll be back in a moment with a lot more from our panel don t go away announcements margaret brennan and we re back with more from our political panel stephen i want to start off with you the journal has a an op ed and you know their op ed pages are often thought to be fairly conservative stephen hayes sure margaret brennan so when they say bloomberg water s warm jump right in to michael bloomberg suggesting he get into this 2020 race and that it might be a good idea should democrats be skeptical of that somewhat endorse endorsement stephen hayes sounds a good trick it it it is a little trick look i think democrats probably should be skeptical of michael bloomberg for for a number of reasons most especially because he s done this before i mean we ve had how many head fakes from michael bloomberg and he s also you know he was a democrat republican independent he sort of covered the gamut and i think you re hearing this from people like elizabeth warren people like bernie sanders who i think are more in touch with the the sort of base of the democratic party that this is not the the democratic savior that that people think he is margaret brennan but is he the kind of candidate who could convince republicans to crossover and vote for him stephen hayes well i think conceivably i mean he certainly has some nanny state aspects to him that i think would make conservatives uncomfortable but i think the immediate impact is much likely to have the opposite effect where he he dilutes support potentially for joe biden he could block a path forward for others who are running in the so called moderate lane like buttigieg amy klobuchar and others so i think if you re elizabeth warren today and you see michael bloomberg getting and you re happy margaret brennan mm hm antjuan you know being a self made billionaire successful businessperson can look at that and says it s the american dream or you can look at that and say this person is suspect and it seems that this person is suspect is what we re hearing more on the campaign trail and that isn t comfortable for everyone antjuan seawright i m not going to criticize him for making money but let me say four things about bloomberg number one most people will agree that the political highway is experiencing a traffic jam because we have too many people running for president on our side and most of the lanes are filled at this point the second point is that it s sunday morning so i ll say this there s a political scripture that i referenced it says the road to heaven and the white house runs through south carolina well he has agreed that he will not participate in the south carolina primary with sixty one percent of the people who vote cast a vote will be african american fifty five percent women most of the states that follow reflects south carolina south carolina was a launch pad for barack obama and a safe haven for hillary clinton margaret brennan also your home state antjuan seawright oh god s country and and then the third thing it is the home of the most prominent and powerful african american in the u s congress jim clyburn and so what bloomberg is saying by not participating in south carolina primary if he gets in is that i have no interest in what majority of african americans think in the south and especially the home of whip jim clyburn that s what i think he s making a mistake and i call it the highest act of malpractice in the campaign can commit margaret brennan wow margaret margaret talev well i mean there are a lot of reasons why a bid would be complicated and i think we re not sure yet that he is going to run there is no way to secretly check the box in alabama without people stephen hayes right margaret talev finding out but but they re they re the case to be made if he did pursue it is that what he s done with his billions of dollars is invest in two of the most important issues to democrats on climate change and on gun control right that he s got support in wall street he s got some support in silicon valley as well and that when you look at the results of last tuesday s election there there may be a market of people in the general election maybe that would be receptive to a message like his but you know the there is also an overarching lesson from the 2016 race which is that when you have a seventeen way or an eighteen way or a nineteen way primary somebody who did not have a chance in a three way race margaret brennan right margaret talev could have a chance stephen hayes right margaret talev and that is all part of the calculus antjuan seawright but you can t you cannot leave margaret brennan and he s got the antjuan seawright the democratic nominee without having strong across the board broad deep and wide support among african american voters he doesn t have that margaret brennan jeffrey jeffrey goldberg but i i do want to say one thing in his defense or in the theoretical defense of this candidacy unlike the other billionaires who are really vanity candidates this is a proven election winner i mean this is a three time mayor of new york city margaret brennan as a democrat republican and independent it will make it perfect jeffrey goldberg i mean i mean he s covered all the bases i mean so so he has overcome a first hurdle he s actually gone before voters and gotten votes and by many accounts that had a largely successful run margaret brennan mm hm jeffrey goldberg as as mayor so i think it does put him in a slightly different lane than just the pure vanity billionaire fast lane margaret brennan well margaret talev but it is the biden but it is the biden lane margaret brennan right margaret talev and it and it complicates that contest inextricably margaret brennan all right thanks to all of you for the analysis we will be right back announcements margaret brennan sixty five years ago the very first guest on face the nation was senator joe mccarthy a politician who rose to prominence on the audacious claim that communists had infiltrated the u s state department the hearings and blacklisting that followed are looked back on as a dark period in american history it serves as a good reminder that it is not entirely new to have this anger vitriol and divisiveness in our country s politics and looking back at the world leaders who have appeared on this program through the years i am also reminded that upheaval and change are constant even if they are disorienting these days you ve never had so many options at your fingertips to quickly receive information or disinformation talk is cheap and you can get an opinion just about anywhere face the nation has always been a place for listening to each other which we all need to do a bit more of in our current climate and for context and perspective that s what our team here at face the nation will continue to try to do each sunday and at sixty five years old we re in our prime we want to wish the united states marine corps a very happy birthday they turned two hundred and forty four today we honor all who currently or previously served in the armed forces and their families on this veterans day weekend thank you all for keeping america safe until next week
