republican strategist who helped to craft the party s 2012 convention normally people want to speak at national conventions it launched barack obama s political career by kristen east trump s team is tight lipped about to whom it ll extend speaking invitations as is the republican national committee but many of the party s most prominent pols say they re flat out not interested and that trump
