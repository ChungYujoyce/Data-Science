bold ideas on the debate stage in miami and an unexpected breakout star here s the verdict from our panelists kate aronoff lloyd green malaika jabali theodore r johnson arwa mahdawi and alexandria villase or thu 27 jun 2019 06 12bst last modified on wed 26 feb 2020 17 56gmt generously speaking democratic presidential candidates tonight spent a little less than 10 minutes after nearly an hour and a half had gone by answering a handful of direct questions about a climate crisis that could make large swathes of the planet horrifically uninhabitable by the end of this century nbc s technical difficulties took nearly as long the best you can say is that tonight s climate bit was still longer than the time spent on climate during the entirety of the 2016 debates nbc should be ashamed of itself so should democratic national chairman tom perez members of the sunrise movement which pushed the idea of the green new deal into the national spotlight late last year are sitting in at the democratic national committee dnc headquarters in washington dc pushing the dnc to organize a debate dedicated solely to the potential end of human civilization as tonight proved it s desperately needed kate aronoff is a writing fellow at in these times she covers elections and the politics of climate change cory booker won wednesday s debate and for one night anyway stole elizabeth warren s thunder booker scored the most tv time close to 11 minutes and the new jersey senator sounded progressive but not extreme substantively booker made a difference in the discourse he refused to buy into medicare for all and acknowledged the need to check corporate consolidation without sounding as if his candidacy was an anti business crusade in the end booker was simultaneously assertive and reassuring his closing had both heft and lift the latter being something badly needed but in short supply this election cycle an attorney in new york lloyd green was opposition research counsel to george hw bush s 1988 campaign and served in the department of justice from 1990 to 1992 tonight s debate was elizabeth warren s to lose and she remained a winner warren shone particularly in the first half where she set a populist tone arguing that it was corrupt for america to have an economy that was great for those with money but not for everyone else she also framed herself as a fighter who would go after big corporations buttressing her positions with passion besides her tone warren argued for structural change calling healthcare a basic human right supporting medicare for all and highlighting the prison industrial complex that disproportionately incarcerates blacks and latinos malaika jabali is a public policy attorney writer and activist whose writing has appeared in essence jacobin the intercept glamour and elsewhere coming into the first democratic primary debate juli n castro was polling at just 1 and 56 of voters hadn t heard or held no opinion of him that will change after tonight no other contender on stage did as much for their candidacy as castro he showed compassion and concern on racial justice issues deep knowledge of immigration law and a fighting spirit as he called attention to policy differences between him and others especially fellow texan beto o rourke this early in the party primary name recognition matters in this regard castro helped his cause substantially it remains to be seen if his debate win translates into more fundraising and electoral support for castro but there s little doubt that after tonight more americans know who he is that s the best outcome he could ve hoped for theodore r johnson is a senior fellow at the brennan center for justice whether it s healthcare gun control or dealing with mitch mcconnell elizabeth warren s got a plan for it she reminded us of her policy chops again tonight in a way that was assertive genuine and immensely presidential of course this debate was always warren s to lose and while she was the most impressive candidate juli n castro may actually have won the night he dominated the section on immigration and springboarded himself into the limelight castro has been overlooked for some time after tonight people will be paying attention as his takedown of the lackluster beto o rourke over immigration reform demonstrated the media has focused far too much on the wrong texan arwa mahdawi is a guardian columnist i was really disappointed in the first night of the democratic debate the climate crisis was not sufficiently discussed and nbc didn t give everyone an equal chance to speak i m a climate activist because it is the biggest issue humanity is facing climate change is part of every issue they talked about including healthcare immigration and the presidency of donald trump climate change is an existential threat and the future of my generation and our entire civilization is at stake with these debates we need to stop focusing on who s popular or who has the best one liner or who people like a pleasing personality won t save this planet alexandria villase or the 14 year old founder of earth uprising international strikes every friday in front of the united nations headquarters demanding world leaders take action on the climate crisis
