watch cbsn live may 10 2019 12 51 pm cbs news cbs news the takeout with major garrett interview with white house chief of staff mick mulvaney may 8 2019 washington d c major garrett welcome to the very best part of my broadcast week i m major garrett welcome to martin s tavern never been here before georgetown haunt of legendary status we are back in the dugout of martin s tavern why do we call it the dugout well because lots of important things happened here over the years lyndon baines johnson when he was a young congressman studied at the feet of sam rayburn then the house speaker those who were involved in drafting the legislation that would lead to the new deal also met back here and m stanton evans a leader of renowned in the conservative movement from the 1950s also gathered here with fellow likeminded conservatives to plot the end of the new deal all of it happened here at martin s tavern not only that jfk proposed to jacqueline bouvier in a booth nearby here richard nixon had a booth here lots of famous people and boy do we have a famous guest this week mick mulvaney and their beer is really good major garrett that s the voice of mick mulvaney acting chief of staff to the president of the united states mick great to see you mick mulvaney it is good to be here it s good to see you major garrett good to see you so what is the difference in the trump white house from chief of staff and acting chief of staff mick mulvaney none as i tell people short of mike pence everybody else in the administration is just acting cause the president can remove you at any time for any reason so it doesn t really make much major garrett and mick mulvaney difference major garrett has mick mulvaney well for some folks i mean face it he had some cabinet folks he didn t like and and major garrett and there s been some white house personnel turnover as well mick mulvaney yeah not not much not not since i ve been there in fact i ve actually had a couple of people come to me right after i took over in december and said they were leaving and they ve since come back and said they d like to stay so things have i think gone really really well the first five months of course as soon as major garrett do you like this mick mulvaney i say that major garrett job mick mulvaney i love this job major garrett why mick mulvaney i m i we deal with everything at i mean yesterday was or two days ago was tiger woods and iran sanctions i mean come on i mean it s just for somebody like me with a with a broad set of interests and a really short attention span this is a great job major garrett did john kelly like this job mick mulvaney i don t think he did you know john is a john is a great american and a just a one of the finest men major garrett your predecessor as chief of staff mick mulvaney one of the finest men i ve ever known not only a four star general but in my mind even more so a gold star father he s given more to this country than i think any anybody else could ever imagine but he didn t like the job and that s okay but he let everybody know he didn t like the job and that s major garrett he got off mick mulvaney that can major garrett to a good start though mick mulvaney he did major garrett i remember having conversations with you when you thought the early disciplinary or discipline he brought was helpful mick mulvaney and necessary and it was a we had a really good run there for about six to eight months major garrett and then what happened mick mulvaney don t have any idea i think he just decided he didn t like the job anymore but again it s fine not to like your job but when you re a leader you can t let the people working for you know you don t like the job major garrett how much of that has to do with the president is he hard to work for mick mulvaney no i don t think he is but again let let let let major garrett some people think he is mick mulvaney he is but let me let me see if this makes any sense i i i m der i m guessing at most this is an educated guess john kelly spent 40 plus years in the marines okay that that is a military culture military lifestyle he s a military guy that s not donald trump and that s not the donald trump white house so while that militaristic sort of approach was necessary to sort of get things back on track after the first couple of months of the administration wasn t the right long term plan it s just like you take over a business that s having difficulty the same team that turns it around is not the same team that runs it long term major garrett tax cuts happen under his watch he told me he created a discipline that helped that happen true mick mulvaney and and he s absolutely right overtalk major garrett credit for mick mulvaney absolutely listen credit for a lot of things we we are better now he he he left the place better than he found it which is all you can i think ask for as a manager had some huge successes did not have any huge failures which is important to what we do i mean cause face it we live on the on the razor s edge every single day you re either you know half a step away from true glory or half a step away from you know real major garrett ultimate failure mick mulvaney trouble yeah and and he did not make any big mistakes and i give him credit for that major garrett couple of questions long term any doubt in your mind what so ever donald trump will be the republican nominee in 2020 mick mulvaney zero none absolutely not major garrett any doubt at all he will win re election mick mulvaney no not re as as things stand right now if election were today we d win going away major garrett election s not today mick mulvaney it s not but a couple different reasons why why are we confident not supremely confident we re cautiously optimistic number one it is the economy stupid at the end of the day it really is and you can t do any better than we ve been doing everybody said we couldn t do it they gave all kinds of reasons for why we could not achieve this level of growth i know you wanna talk about 3 versus 2 gdp growth major garrett stop right there tell my audience laugh it sounds here here here here s the story it sounds like a 1 difference you argue otherwise mick mulvaney so i m sitting there when trey gowdy who s a dear friend of mine probably one of my best friends major garrett been on the show mick mulvaney yeah he he and tim scott and i hang out we re all from south carolina we all got elected together in 2010 so we re at dinner one night when i m rolling out maganomics make america great economics which is this sort of the the theme we came up with with everything to try to get us back to 3 growth and we kept talking about 3 growth and gowdy asked me what what is it now and i said well it s about 1 9 or 2 he said well mick that doesn t sound like that big of a difference it s only 1 difference i m like trey it s not the difference between 2 growth and 3 growth it s a 50 difference which is why i was the budget director and trey was on the judiciary committee we just don t major garrett cheese plate thank you mick mulvaney we did not let trey work with numbers major garrett luis is our waiter here at martin s he s taking care of us sotto voce mick mulvaney this is this is lovely major garrett without even me saying anything things arrive isn t that amazing mick mulvaney food just appears that s major garrett yes it does mick mulvaney nice so and it actually looks healthy major garrett mildly we don t we don t get too deeply in the health thing at the the takeout as you well know laugh mick mulvaney anyway so major garrett and it there s also a practical difference in terms of what 2 to 1 or any 1 differential in gdp means in terms of actual economic activity and job creation mick mulvaney number of jobs the size of the revenues into the government the opportunity available to people that you two young people here who are working with you this is the first time in their adult lives they ve been in a normal american economy what what we saw between 2010 and 2018 or 16 was not normal 1 2 growth is not normal for the united states major garrett people called it a new normal mick mulvaney they did but it s not and we we said again and again and again that we thought if you simply did some basic things and let americans be americans you could get back to 3 growth major garrett you said today at the federalist society that you have achieved something that is structurally different and this is not a sugar high which i ve heard many economists worry about explain that mick mulvaney sugar high is when you just leave everything the same and you just throw a bunch of money into the system to try and sort of jump start it we ve changed the structure of capital of business formation of taxation we ve for example now you re allowed if you invest in your business you re allowed to immedi immediately deduct those capital expenses we ve changed the regulatory environment to where we just make it easier to do business that s not a onetime thing you change a reg you you can somebody an extra dollar that s a one dollar stimulus you change a reg that governs that person s life and that ha that affects them to the be to the benefit every single day so we ve changed so so some of the structure the bones of the economy for the better and that s why major garrett as r as such 3 growth next year mick mulvaney we think so yeah in fact that s major garrett and the year after that mick mulvaney the three per the 3 2 we saw in the first quarter keep in mind add to that these two things typically the last i don t know decade or so the first quarter of the year is typically about nine tenths of a point low okay it just is because of seasonality and so forth also we lost 0 3 of gdp because of the government shutdown major garrett correct mick mulvaney so you put it all together and we re really some place in the mid fours in the first quarter that s fantastic for this point in the business cycle major garrett and you predict that for 2020 mick mulvaney we do our budget has got us to 3 2 this year 3 1 for next year again it s the old normal it s what the american government you take any long period of time throughout our history pick the whatever times you want to and 3 is about what we do major garrett i discussed this last week with our political correspondent ed o keefe goldman sachs put out a projection that unemployment next year will be 3 3 mick mulvaney wow wow major garrett agree mick mulvaney i think it s in the threes keep in mind now you re major garrett does that guarantee the president s re election mick mulvaney n i think it does i absolutely think it does cause i think people again will vote their pocketbooks at the end of the day but there s also an optimism that comes with that one of the numbers we don t talk about much i mentioned this today in my federalist speech was the the the quit number which is the percentage of people who have been separate by from their job by their own choice and that s major garrett voluntarily they left mick mulvaney yeah they quit that s the at historic levels that s people leaving major garrett what does that tell you mick mulvaney they re leaving to take another job they re leaving to move to another city to take an opportunity or they re leaving to start their own business that s optimism and that s that s that s an important number because it speaks right to the heart of what people are thinking about their economy major garrett joe biden bernie sanders lots of others say whatever the numbers are lots of americans still are not benefiting and that will be their cudgel against this president mick mulvaney two major garrett respond mick mulvaney two thirds of americans paid less tax this year than they did last year because of our tax changes most of the folks at the top end of the scale paid more taxes that s just the facts and the democrats can talk about anything they want to and they can lie about anything they want to but that s not gonna change the facts major garrett are they lying about the economy mick mulvaney i think they are they need to they we can t be right cause if we re right they ve got nothing to sell major garrett and you believe you are right and you believe the voters have made that determination or soon will mick mulvaney i think they soon will major garrett that s the voice of mick mulvaney i m major garrett we re at martin s tavern in georgetown back for segment two in just a second music off mic conversation begin segment 2 major garrett my special guest this week mick mulvaney acting white house chief of staff take clo careful notes reporters in washington this is the interview you wish you had so mick mulvaney that s very funky music where did you get that major garrett we can t disclose that mick mulvaney oh i got it alright major garrett it s very secret more secret than even stuff you look at every single day laugh mick mulvaney which means you don t know donald trump on tape major fantastic major garrett thank you mr president so you know joe biden mick mulvaney i ve met him a couple of times yeah major garrett formidable competitor against donald trump mick mulvaney no major garrett why not mick mulvaney people forget d senator biden has t vice president biden has tried this a couple times and failed miserably i don t think he s ever gotten more than 1 in any presidential election and what he s getting ready to do is really really hard i think biden s what 75 76 years old major garrett seventy seven mick mulvaney yeah this is a really hard job what the president major garrett harder than he knows mick mulvaney yes major garrett even though he was vice president and watched it for eight years mick mulvaney yeah cause he didn t run for president he ran for vice president that s i mean mike pence will tell you there s a difference between running for vice president and running for president you sort of come in at the end and you give the big speeches after the guys are already nominated right but when you re out there on the trail every single day knocking on doors i ve done it and it is really really hard work i ve already had some folks major garrett point of clarification you ve knocked on doors you ve not run for president mick mulvaney yes i i i ve knocked on doors asked for votes i mean the the the old fashioned way which is what you have to do in ohio and in new hampshire and in south carolina major garrett he s believes and those around him believe he is the blue collar reagan trump democrat nominee that can eat into the president s base true or false mick mulvaney he s been trying that now he s been blue collar joe for the three or four times he s run for president and it hasn t sold before why would it now major garrett alright let s move on today and we re i want you to know dear listeners and cbsn viewers doing this on wednesday so a lot of things may happen after this but we re gonna live in the moment for a second mick mulvaney it s a slow slow news week major garrett very slow news week the president s attorney general william barr was held in contempt by the house judiciary committee today your reaction mick mulvaney i i wish we had gotten this much attention when we held eric holder in contempt major garrett the obama attorney general mick mulvaney we did that the house voted to hold eric holder in con major garrett yes mick mulvaney and i don t think anybody ever know ever found out about it because we couldn t get any any media coverage so and i think it the the act today in the house major garrett were the were were was the act then more substantive than the act now mick mulvaney yeah i think it was fast and furious major garrett it was about fast and furious it was document withholding and witness withholding mick mulvaney right and there was actually a crime there laugh i mean it was something that was illegal i think the one thing everybody agrees on major garrett fast and furious let my audience remember i cause i m not gonna remind them you remind them you were involved mick mulvaney it was the giving guns to mexican cartels in order to try and f track their whereabouts or something like that it was major garrett correct mick mulvaney again it was a trey gowdy thing i was on the budget committee he was on judiciary but i there there was actually possible wrong doing even granted the really really really hardcore left won t admit this but most folks admit this is that one thing everybody agrees on from the mueller report is that there was no collusion it s all a d major garrett no conspiracy to conspire with the russians mick mulvaney exactly all the discussion now is about obstruction obstruction right but there s no underlying major garrett have you read the mick mulvaney bad behavior major garrett mueller report mick mulvaney i ve read d i ve not read all 400 pieces i ve read most of volume two which is the obstruction thing i ve read about half of the first piece which is the no collusion part major garrett are you proud of the president s behavior in the obstruction section mick mulvaney this this what what we do in major garrett that s a yes or no question mick mulvaney no it no it s not keep in mind that when you and i are are talking and the cam and the and the microphones are off and if we were just here tonight having a private dinner we might act differently than we would if we were on live radio or on live television major garrett i certainly would be mick mulvaney yeah and laugh that s just life and people behave differently when the cameras are not there so so i major garrett granted but now this is recorded for human history mick mulvaney absolutely let major garrett are you proud of it or not mick mulvaney put it this way if don mcgahn or anybody else had thought that they d been asked to do something illegal they would have left i would leave if the president asked me to break the law i would leave don mcgahn worked for 18 months for the president after the incident that s referenced in the mueller report i think that speaks major garrett so he thought it was not mick mulvaney much louder major garrett illegal just kooky mick mulvaney you have to ask don that question but the point of the matter is it s not something that i m ashamed of as a member of this administration major garrett why not mick mulvaney cause i don t think it was wrong i the president is enti the president has the right to hire and fire folks as he sees fit he could fire someone for no reason or for any reason major garrett let me ask you this because mick mulvaney and by the way should the president is entitled to have the cabinet members that that he wants major garrett two questions one i have gotten to the know the president as a reporter whose been around him covered his campaign has some sense of his personality there is a tendency he has to for lack of a better phrase pop off to either rage or sort of go into a place where it s not necessarily in order it s just something he s either spit balling and he sometimes spit balls with a sense of fury around it or anger is that a fair general description of some types of his tendencies under moments of stress mick mulvaney i don t know if it s under moments of stress so let me just major garrett or aggravation mick mulvaney yeah major garrett external aggravation mick mulvaney obviously the president does does think out loud i i think he major garrett right and sometimes in mick mulvaney he bounces ideas off of people we do it all the time i got asked the other day let me see if i can answer your question this way i got asked the question the other day have you ever disobeyed a pre the president s order okay it s a good question major garrett right mick mulvaney i said look major garrett central mick mulvaney let me let me turn it back and and and this is how i answered i said look if the president calls me into the office and says why are we spending money on this say foreign aid program and i say oh i don t know mr program sic mr president i look he goes i don t wanna do that stop that money i m like okay and i go back and i do the research and i find out there s a specific line item appropriation for congress that says i have to spend that money and i go back to him and say i didn t not spend that money cause it s the law says i have to have i disobeyed him major garrett no mick mulvaney exactly i ve done major garrett you ve informed him mick mulvaney i ve inf i ve done exactly what i was supposed to do and i think that s that s major garrett do you do you mick mulvaney that s what happens a lot major garrett would you say what happened in the mueller report and the obstruction section falls into that category mick mulvaney i would i gen yeah generally s again i wasn t there in all fairness my exposure to what you ve read about in the mueller report comes from reading the mueller report i haven t talked to anybody about it afterwards cause there s no reason to and i was not involved with it then i m not even in the bibliography i don t think so i m getting it all sort of through the mueller report major garrett right but you ve been around the president and none of that reads to you like fiction mick mulvaney oh in terms of the president s behavior no in terms of of what people said well and then i went home and i wrote a memo and i put it in a safe i have no idea cause i mean i i don t if that s fiction or not major garrett so the white house has ex exerted or as assigned to itself executive privilege over some of requested documents from the house judiciary committee is that in perpetuity they re never gonna see em that s just it gonna be it mick mulvaney yeah i would think so i mean it they re not entitled to see them keep in mind what they re asking for my understanding is that they re asking for the un redacted mueller report the mueller report was very lightly redacted in the first place major garrett and the underlying evidence mick mulvaney right well let s let s deal with that a second okay which is the mueller report was lightly redacted in the first place and redacted for reasons that everybody agrees are the right reasons to redact it i think most of the redactions and it it was very lightly i think it s less than 10 of the report was redacted in the first place but almost all of that was redactions related to ongoing criminal investigations mostly i think michael cohen and a couple other people that s the law the other part that s redacted is grand jury testimony which is also legally supposed to be redacted so the stuff that congress saw is the stuff that everybody who s got any sense about them knows needed by law to be redacted we then made it available in an un redacted fashion i think to a couple of very high ranking members of the committee major garrett right which they found insufficient mick mulvaney i i i m not sure how they find it insufficient it s everything that there is now that goes to the second part of your question about the the underlying documents and stuff and this is where we sort of draw an even firmer line they are not the department of justice they they do have a they do have a right by the way it s not in the constitution it s been implied in the constitution by the supreme court to have some oversight okay major garrett yes mick mulvaney and they have a right major garrett it is implied and precedential it s not in the constitution mick mulvaney bingo they have the right to do that that s fine that doesn t mean they get to second guess the department of justice that doesn t mean they get to s to sort of supplement their decision for the s for the decision of the attorney general they are not the executive branch of government they are there to make law and their oversight is supposed to be related to their process of making law and that s not what happened that s not what s happening right now major garrett but there is an assertion from this white house on a lot of subpoenas on a lot of requests from the house democratic majority no you the answer to you is no and i wanna read you a story today written by adam liptak in the new york times here s the lead president trump s wholesale refusal to provide information to congress threatens to upend the delicate balance that is the separation of powers outlined in the constitution that s the lead mick mulvaney it s a complete hyperbole major garrett it quotes a gentleman named william p marshall a law professor at the university of north carolina a president who refuses to respond to congressional oversight is taking the presidency to new levels of danger we re supposed to be in system of checks and balances and one of the biggest checks that congress has over the executive is the power of congressional oversight mick mulvaney can i s major garrett respond mick mulvaney can i see that for a second major garrett yeah sure mick mulvaney what s the date on that is that major garrett today mick mulvaney is that is that major garrett november may 7th today mick mulvaney so that s not 2012 when obama was denying all of our subpoenas that we sent him all of our requests for documentation i listen my my firsthand experience with this actually deals more with the cfpb and richard cordray who would wouldn t even agree to come see us in committee without getting major garrett remind my audience what overtalk major garrett cfpb is mick mulvaney i m sorry major garrett remind my audience mick mulvaney oh the the consumer financial protection bureau my point is that that could have just as easily been written about the obama administration there is a natural major garrett and that it wasn t then and is now mick mulvaney there s a nat major garrett tells you what mick mulvaney there s a natural major garrett what are you saying mick mulvaney there s a natural tension between the executive branch and the legislative branch and every time one types to reach tends to reach tries to reach into the other the one other one pushes back major garrett right but are you saying it s only topical or new york times topical when the litigant is president trump and the majority is house democrats mick mulvaney my guess is they didn t write that same piece about president obama major garrett and what does that tell you mick mulvaney that they re major garrett what are you asserting mick mulvaney i m i m asserting bias there s no question about it major garrett that s the voice of mick mulvaney i m major garrett we re at martin s tavern in georgetown back in a moment music off mic conversation begin segment 3 announcer from cbs news this is the takeout with major garrett major garrett welcome back major garrett here acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney is our guest it is said today mick mulvaney i m i m i m sorry but we have to get you some new music major garrett no no mick mulvaney that s just not you that doesn t fit major garrett that s okay we we re we re living with it it s really good that s really good we love it mick mulvaney this is such a good show but i don t know major garrett it is such a good show there is no question about that so it is said mr mulvaney that donald trump junior today was subpoenaed by the senate intelligence committee which is run by a republican true mick mulvaney i understand it to be true yeah i found out about that just before i came over here major garrett implications mick mulvaney i have no idea major garrett scared mick mulvaney again i have no opinion about it because he is a private citizen and not a member of the administration that being said the fact that the president s son got a subpoena from a republican led committee and i listen i m all for bipartisanship on the on intel committees i think it s one of adam schiff s great failings is to is to sort of politicize the intel committee in the house so i have no difficultly with bipartisanship but to subpoena the president of the united states son and at least get a heads up i thought was let s say bad form major garrett so what you re telling me is there was no heads up mick mulvaney i i didn t know about it major garrett right do you believe the president did mick mulvaney i have no idea actually in in fairness i don t know cause he left for florida today before major garrett doesn t feel like it though mick mulvaney i did all i can tell you what i know is and i know i didn t know major garrett right and let s just say ladies and gentleman mick mulvaney would be in a position to know mick mulvaney laugh under most well again may maybe not because again he s a private citizen not a member of the administration but it was be har highly unlikely that it would end up in the white house and i wouldn t know about it major garrett let me ask you this mick mulvaney possible possible but not likely major garrett possible but not likely so mick mulvaney yeah i m not involved in the president s his his legal matters regarding his business his legal legal legal matters regarding his family i i i don t do that i handle the west wing of the government major garrett right but it is a matter of more than general concern i mean any anything dealing with something like this it would have to rise to your level mick mulvaney i have no i zero and i m not making this up i have no idea as to what the the factual allegations are i know i mean i know it deals with a trump tower discussion or something like that but again my knowledge of this comes mostly from reading media reports because i m not involved with that in the white house major garrett so i want you to speak to my audience nationwide mick mulvaney i thought i was speaking to your audience nationwide major garrett about this question because they heard i suspect something from the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell earlier this week which was this case closed so they say you know what i kind of agree but then they hear the republican led intelligence community committee subpoenas the president s son well that doesn t sound like case closed what would you tell them mick mulvaney they re two different people they they do share the same name and certainly don junior is the president s son but i think when m what mr mcconnell was speaking to was that the president has been exonerated there was no collusion and no obstruction period end of story now it s time to move onto the business of government does that mean that other individuals may or may have not done other things i have no idea but i think that s what mr mcconnell was speaking to was the implications for the president of the united states there is no reason that mcconnell would go to the floor to talk about don junior that s just not gonna happen he was talking about the president major garrett got it so the treasury secretary this week informed richard neil the chairman of the house of ways and means committee that the treasury department after consulting the justice department will not provide the president s taxes you ve gone on the record saying congress will never see them you mick mulvaney that s absolutely right major garrett why mick mulvaney because they re not entitled to see them by law they by the way they know especially on this one they know they re never gonna get these documents this is a pure show pony type of situation they know the legal reasons they can get those documents and they major garrett legislate legitimate legislative function mick mulvaney right and they they re not even close to that they re doing it ask em you come in bring em in here and throw a couple beers in em they ll tell you they re just doing this to make the president look bad they don t care this is not about information about the president keep in mind all of the president s financial holdings by law are disclosed you wanna know what the president owns you wanna know how he makes money all of that stuff is by law disclosed i have to fill out my form by the end of next week so does he okay this is just about trying to embarrass the president overtalk major garrett what s embarrassing about his tax records mick mulvaney that s what that s what they wanna know major garrett well what is mick mulvaney that s what they want major garrett but what is it mick mulvaney i i don t know cause i ve never seen them major garrett is there something embarrassing about his tax records mick mulvaney i have no idea cause i don t see and i don t care and more importantly voters don t care keep in mind everybody knew everybody who cared knew that the president didn t produce his tax records before the election and they voted for him anyway so from a political perspective this debate is over the democrats are trying to continue that political conversation major garrett when you hear mick mulvaney and there s no reason to do it major garrett that the new york legislature may seek to obtain them or california and its legislature is saying if you don t disclose your tax returns you cannot appear on the ballot what s the white house reaction mick mulvaney it s a it s a really interesting que i have i this is not an official reaction cause we ve not had a chance to discuss it it s a really interesting question as to whether or not you know the states do control their own ballot major garrett and ballot access mick mulvaney exactly so that s major garrett it is a state s right to overtalk mick mulvaney so there s an interesting major garrett and it has long been mick mulvaney there s an interesting aspect of that major garrett and and under the federal federalism yes mick mulvaney absolutely so that s an interesting aspect of it major garrett as a conservative i would think you would think that is mick mulvaney i m i m major garrett within it within its boundaries mick mulvaney my natural inclin major garrett and purview mick mulvaney my natural inclination was to was to devolve more power to the states at the same time is it relevant cause i got news for you democrats are gonna win california and new york anyway major garrett okay so the president doesn t need to be on the ballot mick mulvaney he s still going to win re election without california and new york i mean i i i think if the overtalk major garrett that s news right there mick mulvaney if the election if the election were today major garrett the president of the united states will win re election without california or new york of course mick mulvaney yes he did win he he major garrett hey he won the first time of course mick mulvaney i mean the last republican to win california and new york i think was was was reagan major garrett yes mick mulvaney so i mean you can be elected a president you can be a republican elected a president without new york and california and he s going to be major garrett there you go i wanna ask you mick mulvaney did i really make news by major garrett a little bit about mick mulvaney saying he s not gonna win california major garrett no no i wanna ask you about this that he doesn t care about being on the ballot because mick mulvaney i didn t say that i didn t say that major garrett so he d he does wanna be on the ballot in california mick mulvaney yes absolutely major garrett okay because that is the state that provided the highest number of trump votes laugh mick mulvaney yeah and it s good for the party and all of that major garrett just because there s 33 and a half million people there mick mulvaney and we re gonna we re gonna we re gonna we re gonna fight to be on the ballot you asked me a question about legalities of it i think it s a very interesting legal question major garrett it is a very interesting legal question back to our conversation about don mcgahn so there s an interesting dialogue that goes on quite separate from the president in this regard if the newly elected president neither whether it s donald trump or anyone else gives an order and it s not carried out do we have a functioning presidency in a republic as we ve constitutionally understood it yes or no mick mulvaney well again go back to my example the president gave me an instruction to stop funding this piece of foreign aid and we still funded it did did the government stop functioning or did the government function exactly the way it s supposed to function major garrett right but but in this case as you well know this is about a personnel matter of which the executive has authority and if the executive meaning the chief executive gives an order and it s not carried out within the purview of the executive branch itself do we have a functioning presidency mick mulvaney if the president comes to me today and says look i want you to to fire and so and so okay i might go back to him tomorrow and make sur mr president you i m getting ready to do this you sure about this one that s just good that s good that s a good partnership between a chief of staff and a president between the president and the white house council especially on big decision do you wanna have a chance to think about it look we we did we took some overtalk major garrett that sounds like some to quote don mcgahn according to the mueller report some crazy s mick mulvaney no it s not not not at all major garrett that s what that s what the mueller report mick mulvaney well i think i think i think don s wrong about that i think that s just that s good staff work if the president tells you to do something of tremendous import and you major garrett political and otherwise mick mulvaney and otherwise and you say look let s think about this overnight what s wrong with that major garrett understood mick mulvaney goodness gracious that s that s that s what we should be doing major garrett let me ask you about some pending potential business on the hill infrastructure are you comfortable with two trillion dollars yes or no mick mulvaney comfortable if we can pay for it yeah i think i ve said a couple times it s relatively in in the world of government relatively easy to find a trillion once you start inching up above that it gets harder and harder and i m not sure you can get to two trillion without new sources of revenue major garrett let s go to that is this administration or will it ever be in favor of increasing the gasoline tax mick mulvaney i don t i don t think so i don t see us doing that major garrett how about indexing it mick mulvaney i don t i i listen the president is not interested the president happens worked so hard to make sure people have more money that s what our whole economic policy has been about it s working wages are going up for the first time in a long time people are making more money for the first time in a long time to turn around then and take money away from them through higher taxes is just not consistent with what he s about major garrett some economists would say he s doing that with tariffs mick mulvaney the keep in mind though the tariffs are the tariffs are there for a reason and i think we ve established this in a in a bunch of different circumstances the president will tell you and even hardcore free traders larry kudlow will tell you this that the only reason china is talking to us now about fixing the structural deficiencies in our trade relationship is because we ve put tariffs on them so they are a very powerful tool to get people to talk to you major garrett reminding my audience this is wednesday friday night coming midnight is a deadline will there be increased tariffs on china mick mulvaney i think so the president has said that there would be and we re not making enough progressive we had making some but not enough also between tonight tonight and saturday night the chinese vice premier expects to washington dc so major garrett but you know and i know that it will be almost impossible to wrap everything up in that one day meeting mick mulvaney yeah but you know look listen we re interested in seeing progress and if there s progress major garrett but to to pin you down on this it s not only it s not as i ve heard it the lack of progress it is a regression mick mulvaney yeah there was certainly that there was there s no question major garrett spell it out mick mulvaney they they went back on some of things that that we thought major garrett spell it out mick mulvaney we had agreed on i don t know what i can t give you more details than that but we we thought we had we had agreement in principal on a couple major garrett they were less mick mulvaney of things major garrett they were less willing as i ve read and been told to commit to the kind of enforcement mechanisms that would be central to their legal system and give us a degree of confidence about that mick mulvaney i i think the thing that i saw it was maybe we re not saying major garrett maybe it overtalk major garrett vernacular mick mulvaney something that s that yeah that s not any different is that they were hemming and hawing about how easy it might be to get their legislature to pass some things to enforce to to enact the agreement major garrett that s the voice mick mulvaney acting chief of staff to the president of the united states donald trump i m major garrett we re at martin s in georgetown back in a second break in tape begin segment 4 announcer in progress bs news this is the takeout with major garrett major garrett that s me mick mulvaney acting chief of staff president of the united states mick mulvaney that s me major garrett is with us do you want to be the president of the university of south carolina mick mulvaney no major garrett ever mick mulvaney no a friend of mine was on the board of trustees there and he asked me about it last thanksgiving before the i got the chief s job and then we had one conversation over coffee and that was it major garrett absolute no right mick mulvaney yeah no non issue major garrett do you want to be the commerce secretary mick mulvaney no major garrett okay this is the last job you ll have in the trump administration mick mulvaney i think so yeah major garrett will you have it on election day 2020 mick mulvaney if he s happy with me yeah i like the job i d like to stay major garrett okay good mick mulvaney i i i would think what does a successful chief tenure look like taking us through the next 18 months winning reelection helping the president put together both his team and his agenda for the second for the second term and then doing somethin else major garrett let me ask you about immigration what is this administration s approach to trying to engage congress to change the laws and appropriate the money a substantial number of billions you ve asked for to deal with the situation on the border mick mulvaney trying to break it down into small pieces i met personally with several members democrat members of the senate and this was essentially m my message i said look it is a crisis and i think now everybody agrees in fact the new york times this week said it was a crisis major garrett the numbers are a mick mulvaney staggering major garrett fundamentally different mick mulvaney yes major garrett context and character that is a fact ladies and gentlemen mick mulvaney now four months ago when we said that nancy pelosi didn t believe me she said she thought we were lying this is back during the shutdown now i think everybody recognizes major garrett human beings are involved mick mulvaney that s exactly right we are we were right this is a humanitarian crisis it s a security crisis you have to do something so we went to them and said look let s not we re not trying to solve everything we need to solve this major garrett what mick mulvaney what s happening now at the border major garrett what do you need mick mulvaney we re out of money in the next couple of weeks dhs will not have enough money to do its job hhs will not have enough money to do its job and by that i mean they won t have enough money to to to hold people okay it s out of money and major garrett then what mick mulvaney you major garrett then what happens mick mulvaney we we re closed we we we can t function major garrett then they re all released mick mulvaney it s against the law for us to spend money that s unappropriated major garrett that means they re all released mick mulvaney i i don t know what happens we ve never gotten to that point secondly the laws need to be changed because right now major garrett you need money in two weeks mick mulvaney between two and seven depending on different agencies so un unaccompanied child this is not about child separation that s what i told them and i think they understand this if an unaccompanied child comes in now they re held by by dhs for 72 hours and they re supposed to be given to hhs but if hhs doesn t have space for them which they don t dhs can t do anything they can t hold em for longer than that because of the flores agreement they can t give em to hhs cause hhs doesn t have the space they can t turn em over to an ngo cause that s against the law non government organization and they can t send them back where they came from because that s against the law so literally these children are stateless they re they re they re nothing and we can t do anything with em and that needs to be fixed and i think some of of the democrats who are willing to to you know some some are running for president and they ve checked out but the ones who are serious about the issue are taking this seriously major garrett right but they also believe you have a structural problem at dhs lots of turnover and they believe zero tolerance led to an unnecessarily cruel policy of family separation mick mulvaney yeah but unnec child separation has noth major garrett they have a hard time dealing with you because of that sense of grievance mick mulvaney that s fine and i get that which is why we re down there and why we ve got kevin mcaleenan down there now doing a good job i think he s got a lot of credibility major garrett acting secretary of dhs mick mulvaney and a career guy a really good guy major garrett is he gonna be the permanent nominee mick mulvaney you know i don t know it s a good question i l let s see how he handles the the this this situation right now but there s no way you can say that what we re f experiencing at the border now is tied to child separation cause if anything if anything there s no way that child separation could encourage more people to come to this country major garrett true enough mick mulvaney so the the we major garrett but it also from their point of view would say these that means or suggests doesn t mean it suggests possibly that these asylum claims are real that their fear of violence or economic privation is real real enough that they would take this great mick mulvaney fine major garrett personal risk mick mulvaney and if it s real they get to stay it does the facts are that i think it s more than 80 of of people who are adjudicated on their asylum claims get denied economic deprivation is not a basis for asylum just because you don t have an opportunity or you re poor in your home country doesn t mean you get to come to the united states you have to be in in in in incredible fear for your own safety and security major garrett so let s go around the globe quickly mick mulvaney oh goodness gracious the lightning round major garrett yes the lightning round mick mulvaney all right fire away major garrett why is a strike group with a carrier being moved to iran and why does the country believe or the pentagon believe that there is enough intelligence to suggest the iranians want to attack u s personnel mick mulvaney i i won t speak to the intelligence you know cause that s that s obviously stuff that i can t talk about public major garrett but the pentagon has gone on the record of saying th we ve picked up things that give us concern mick mulvaney yeah but i m not gonna tell you what they are i m sorry i misunderstood your question why why are they there for the same reason we ve been there for a long time we have specific interests in the region we have troops for example in iraq we have good allies in saudi arabia and the uae and and and bahrain we have we have military assets there to protect we have interests in the region we have an interest in seeing the oil continue to flow through the straits of hormuz even though we don t import very much of it by the way most of our imported oil actually comes from canada believe it or not and mexico so we there is there is an inter major garrett and at one time venezuela mick mulvaney yeah exactly it s an international interest that we have an interest in in s making sure that the shipping lanes stay open so this is what the american navy does it goes major garrett should the average american be more or less concerned about the prospect of military confrontation with iran mick mulvaney less i i major garrett less mick mulvaney yeah i i i i i think that i i don t want to guess at the future but we we are not going to war in iran i think what you re gonna see is us over there to enforce and protect our interests i mean iran is going through some real tough times right now it s one of the reasons we you know they re acting major garrett increased s sanctions mick mulvaney the sanctions are bad inflation is terrible overtalk major garrett but the europeans are getting increasingly concerned about them pulling out of some measures of the iran nuclear deal which this administration a year ago got out of mick mulvaney yeah and i think we got out of it because we were right and the europeans were wrong we said look the iranians are interested in building nuclear weapons and i think one of the reasons you hear them sort of hemming and hawing about that is they re still interested in doing it the europeans are now just finally realizing it major garrett north korea provocative actions provocative language and the north koreans today it was confirmed by the u s no longer cooperating in the r return of remains of u s personnel from the korean conflict it seems like so many of the things that looked at least initially positive have come a cropper mick mulvaney i can t comment on the second one cause in all fairness i m hearing something i ve not heard before about the the the the return of the remains major garrett that was confirmed by the agency involved today mick mulvaney okay thank i i believe you i just i ve not heard that so i won t comment on it the regarding major garrett the leader of that who s been on this show and we ve talked mick mulvaney i i believe it major garrett about it and i care about overtalk major garrett this issue a lot mick mulvaney i believe you and you should and it s an important issue we care about it i just don t you re telling me something i don t know so i don t want to comment about it the regarding the the supposed provocation very minor these were very minor projectiles they were very short term major garrett how about the rhetoric mick mulvaney they w the rhetoric is not major garrett pompeo bolton mick mulvaney no listen the the rhetoric i m more concerned about the rhetoric coming out of north korea these missiles whatever they were whatever you want to call them they were very small and n not aimed at japan not aimed at at guam they were aimed up the north korean coast so it s a very non provocative provocation if there is such a thing so look major garrett you re looking for ways to describe it as such it sounds to me mick mulvaney well you know the relationship between kim jong un and the president still remains good we are still confident that we have additional talks we want additional talks we think it s major garrett do you want another summit mick mulvaney eventually yeah i think we do keep in mind the reason the president walked away last time and i was there i was at the table major garrett so was i mick mulvaney yeah was that we just got the impression they were not really willing to negotiate they were not willing to actually bargain and they gave us an offer and and you know take it or leave it offer five different times and assumed we couldn t take it so we had to leave it so when they re ready to actually have a negotiation we we do want to continue those discussions major garrett venezuela what is the policy it looks as if it s adrift mick mulvaney we no the policy s not adrift we continue to support guaido we are not you know while all options are on the table and we mean that seriously so you can read that overtalk major garrett but the pentagon is not a fan of this you know that mick mulvaney the presi the pentagon will do what the president wants them to do that s what they re there to do so we cont major garrett but i m not wrong about that mick mulvaney we look at all options no i i no i i m gonna disagree with you i m gonna say that we re gonna do what we have to do down there but clearly major garrett what do we have to do and what s in unintel mick mulvaney we are gonna we are gonna support the guaido major garrett are we gonna make sure he mick mulvaney government major garrett becomes the new leader mick mulvaney no i i i i think i i don t think we re gonna take affirmative action to make him become the leader we re gonna continue to back him is it moving slower than some people thought that it might perhaps but that doesn t mean that that things are over by any means down there major garrett that s the voice of mick mulvaney acting chief of staff to the 45th president of the united states donald trump i m major garrett we re at martin s tavern in
