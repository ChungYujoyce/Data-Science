the following is a transcript of an interview with fedex ceo frederick w smith that aired sunday march 22 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan we now go to the chairman and ceo of fedex frederick smith who is in memphis tennessee this morning good to see you thank you for joining us fedex ceo frederick w smith good morning margaret brennan our latest reporting is that this bill congress is still negotiating contains about eight billion dollars in rescue money for carriers will your company be seeking any part of that federal aid smith i don t think so at this point in time it would only be available or needed by fedex and the all cargo industry if things really get bad and then only in the form of loan guarantees now the passenger carriers which have a 50 billion dollar package that s a different story they re in very dire straits with significant lack of demand that s not the situation with us in certain cases our business has actually increased because of this situation in others it s declined so i doubt that we ll need it but it s a good thing to have there so we don t have to shut down long term projects like facility construction and purchase of airplanes and trucks and things of that nature margaret brennan provide some certainty for your planning but your ceo of one of your divisions fedex express signed onto a letter yesterday that was released he signed alongside some of those passenger carrier ceos and it urged congress to swiftly pass this bill they re still negotiating or saying there will be mass furloughs there will be mass layoffs what size of of layoffs are we talking about what is your company expecting smith well fedex is not expecting any layoffs at all quite the contrary our people are working very heavily on both the business to business side moving things for hospitals and diagnostic labs picking up specimens and getting them into the various locations where they can be tested the passenger carriers again that s a completely different story they have very little demand at the moment for their services and if they don t get this 50 million dollar relief and i think that s mostly loan guarantees as well they will begin massive layoffs they have no option margaret brennan there are for you and in the cargo side you are still able to function to deliver things around the world but there are significant travel restrictions what are you seeing in terms of supply lines staying open smith well we began to deal with this problem in our operations in china in january and there we took extraordinary measures to protect our people and our pilots just last week for instance we flew 246 flights in and out of china so we ve been dealing with this for a long time china is now actually back mostly in production about 90 percent of their big factories are open their smaller businesses less so but about 70 percent so with the shut down of the passenger operations across the pacific we have significant backlogs coming into this country and a significant amount of traffic going back to china more recently the same thing s true across the atlantic our purple tail airplanes are carrying a lot of stuff both ways passenger planes which carry a lot of cargo in the underbelly including some for us margaret brennan yeah smith they re all but gone from the market margaret brennan but but it sounds like you re saying trade can continue though passenger travel is restricted i i want to ask you about the safety of your employees as well here i mean there are reports that we saw in the new england journal of medicine recently saying that this virus can survive on different surfaces for different periods of time on cardboard it can survive for about 24 hours how do you protect delivery workers who are literally going to americans front doors smith well we have massive efforts underway in all of our facilities to try to socially distance folks and their workstations we re providing gloves and all kinds of antiseptic swabs and things of that nature for people that are receiving packages the cdc says not too much risk but if you ve got concerns take a little alcohol and rub it across the package after it s left on your door which is what we re doing we suspended the requirement for signatures in certain cases so i think that the risk is low and we re doing absolutely everything we can cleaning our facilities prolifically the place i m talking to you from one floor up we had an employee last week that tested positive for it we cleaned the building we have lots of people working from home so you just have to work through the issue using every measure at your disposal we re moving a prolific amount margaret brennan yeah smith of hand sanitizer for instance in our freight company at the moment margaret brennan i m sure you are fred smith thank you for joining us and giving us your insight watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or
