stories from three grieving families of covid 19 victims i didn t say goodbye because i didn t think it was goodbye many victims of the novel coronavirus take their last breath through a ventilator often they are alone their loved ones are prohibited from being with them in person but if they are fortunate they might catch a last glimpse through a smartphone screen in these patients final moments it is the doctors and nurses who see the virus s grim toll bearing witness behind facemasks and protective gear roughly 50 000 deaths have been attributed to covid 19 in the united states most of them taking place in the eerie isolation of an intensive care unit but an uncounted number of victims have died in a markedly different way suddenly robbed of life in their beds or on their couches in the home where doctors had told them to shelter for safety many of their deaths are not factored into the national covid 19 death toll because medical examiners did not have the capacity to test them for the virus while family members of those who die at home have seen death s pallor their grief takes many shades some are angry wondering whether things might have turned out differently if a doctor had directed their loved one to go to the hospital some are grateful for the extra moments they could share some are left to sort through their loneliness in the very room where the death took place here three people who watched helplessly as death gave no notice share their loved ones last days in the place they called home people like tim who are dying at home it s a waste and it s a tragedy there are people who have died in new york city i m from new york my heart goes out to the people of new york the towers coming down was awful this is worse this is affecting all of us whether we re in new york or not it was so insidious and it snuck up slowly when news last month indicated covid 19 had begun spreading throughout the world tim liszewski did not think he had reason to be worried the 60 year old did not get sick often and had no underlying health issues no diabetes no heart disease he dealt with two pulmonary embolisms a few years ago but his fianc e maris burton said he had recovered well and subsequently had no compromised lung function he was also physically active an avid hiker he had hiked the northern portion of the appalachian trail last spring and he and burton were preparing to hike spain s lighthouse way for their honeymoon this may so when he left his columbia south carolina home to fly to wisconsin for a work retreat on march 9 he joked with burton about bringing disinfecting wipes to clean his seat on the plane when liszewski returned home from the retreat on march 12 he was coughing and sneezing the next day burton said they took a three mile walk along the saluda river but by that weekend liszewski was not feeling well enough for their usual hike nor could he muster the energy to perform his weekly service work feeding the homeless and volunteering for the nickelodeon a local nonprofit movie theater figuring liszewski just had a cold he and burton stocked up on over the counter medicine and comfort food including chicken soup and a bag of navel oranges liszewski cut one the next day offering a slice to burton man this is a disappointing orange burton remembers saying it just doesn t taste right by the following weekend they both felt ill with temperatures hovering around 100 degrees liszewski consulted a doctor who found that his symptoms qualified him for a covid 19 test so he got tested that saturday while burton stayed in bed too sick to leave the doctors told him he would get the results back in two to five days we have our wedding planned for may 23rd the save the date cards have gone out we ve been following the coronavirus not just with our illness but we re hearing about in italy and france and china and out in california and washington state this thing is here spain where we re planning to honeymoon is making noises about closing it down so tim and i starting to talk about you know i think we re going to have to postpone it and not just for a couple of months we want people to be able to travel and we re thinking you know what s a year we ve waited this long it s been 15 years engaged for five so we ll just plan this for next may 23rd or 22nd to be a saturday so we re kind of coming to peace at all right we re not getting married this spring liszewski got his first taste of political activism in 2004 when he volunteered for democratic presidential primary candidate rep dennis kucinich who was from his hometown of cleveland that year liszewski attended the democratic national convention where he was one of 43 delegates who cast their vote for kucinich burton said after the election liszewski was recruited to become director of the carolina peace resource center a public interest group in south carolina that advocates non violence a post on the group s facebook page remembered liszewski tim is fondly remembered for among other things his kindness and commitment dry humor and for quickly organizing a large candlelight rally with gold star mothers cindy sheehan and elaine johnson at columbia s martin luther king park in 2005 despite only two days notice not a small feat recently liszewski became the great plains regional director for indivisible a grassroots organization whose goal is to elect progressive candidates and defeat president trump s agenda tim was an activist a kind hearted gentle man he loved sports loved his cleveland indians the cavaliers cleveland browns and a lover of life of music of literature nature and art he loved to make friends wherever he went but he was also an introvert one of the things that we talked about a lot was how his chosen field was being an organizer and a trainer where he had to interact with people on a daily hourly basis and then he d be exhausted and the end of a conversation or a meeting he d come home and just be quiet as liszewski awaited the results of his covid 19 test burton says his condition got worse his head hurt he was nauseated and had no appetite he tried eating a favorite candy jellied fruit slices but it suddenly tasted strange to him when his temperature hit 101 9 he called his doctor who prescribed zofran for the nausea and told him to up his dose of extra strength tylenol to two pills at a time before he went to bed on friday march 27 his temperature had lowered to 99 degrees he wakes up saturday morning 6 30 he s restless can t sleep and says you need to sleep i m going to go downstairs i ll just play on the computer or something i go okay so he goes downstairs and i go back to sleep and wake up at about 10 00 i see he s not in bed with me and the house just feels still i have a parrot and typically when any of us are downstairs the parrot likes to chat to us he doesn t talk but he makes an awful lot of noise and i hadn t heard any squawking from downstairs and i go downstairs death has a stillness it s more than absence of life it is ultimate quiet and he s slumped over on the couch and i knew he was dead four days after liszewski died and 11 days after he took the test the county coroner s office called burton to confirm her fianc had been infected with covid 19 because liszewski tested positive for the virus the coroner could not perform an autopsy on him out of safety for morgue personnel burton is not sure if receiving the results earlier would have made a difference liszewski had a fever a headache and lost his sense of smell not symptoms they likely would have deemed worthy of going to the hospital she said but she said she is frustrated that doctors might not know how to prevent deaths like liszewski s in the future his death certificate lists acute respiratory distress syndrome pneumonia and covid 19 as causes of death burton disagrees with that conclusion liszewski never complained about shortness of breath or trouble breathing she explains burton wonders if the coroner cannot perform an autopsy to determine what happened how the coronavirus paved its path of destruction how can doctors prevent deaths like tim s in the future had he gone into the hospital he would have been in isolation because he was suspected covid 19 i m suspected covid 19 so i could not have been with him he would have died in the hospital with not even a nurse around because the sudden death i am blessed and grateful that tim died at home with me i didn t say goodbye because i didn t think it was goodbye but we were doing our usual hugging and kissing he was with me he was home he was here and he was loved this is a hole in your heart that will never be filled again you know as time goes on i m sure we ll reach a point my wife and i that we ll be able to think about him and smile but my wife lost her father 17 years ago and she said it was devastating but it s nothing compared to losing a child parents aren t supposed to be burying their children it s supposed to be the other way around it was on march 31 so it s still almost surreal and you have good days and bad days but it s the little things that will happen or you ll see that really make it hit home that this is real and those are the times you just break down when robert hirschmann came down with flu like symptoms last month he knew he had to isolate from his wife denise and their four children a two time cancer survivor hirschmann has used a feeding tube for years because of the long term side effects of radiation treatments for stage four neck cancer the tube has cause him to aspirate which has led to pneumonia nearly a dozen times so when he learned about the symptoms of covid 19 he knew he was high risk he confined himself to his bedroom elsewhere in hirschmann s fraser michigan home his 24 year old son ben was quarantined in his own room the younger hirschmann began feeling sick around march 19 and when the coughing headache and fever persisted for a few days he decided to seek medical care ben couldn t see his primary care physician in person because she was taking all her appointments through telemedicine robert said the hospital system his doctor is with was using the videoconferencing format to protect its healthcare providers and brace for a surge of covid 19 patients over the video appointment ben s doctor told him he probably had the flu his father said ben was prescribed cough medicine and told to take over the counter medicine to treat his fever and headache then the doctor told him to stay home isolated in their separate bedrooms robert and his son didn t see much of each other as they tried to recuperate ben any picture you see of him there s a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye i mean when he walked into a room people smiled and it became a happier place he loved to dance he went to his cousin s wedding that was in jamaica and he was up on stage in the dance contest and he won it of course he had a heart of gold he would do anything for anybody as much as a staunch conservative he is he s not one that hates the other side if you have different views than him that was fine and he could still become good friends with you you know a good person s a good person regardless of their political persuasion robert said wherever his son went friendships followed ben s all boys catholic high school grand valley state university and the rallies he attended in support of president donald trump ben was an active volunteer for the michigan republican party and in 2016 even landed a spot in the vip section behind then candidate trump during a speech in grand rapids in 2018 he worked phone banks at the local republican headquarters to get out the vote during the midterm elections and earlier this year he attended anti impeachment rallies at each event he connected with fellow trump supporters from around the country a lot of us are from other states ben told a buzzfeed reporter at a trump rally in 2017 this is a great way where we can all meet up again and coordinate and see each other a few years ago ben interned for michigan state senator peter lucido lucido remembers an energetic young man who loved politics at every event he makes the room swell with joy that he s there and anticipation of what s to come lucido said this young man would have made a very special public servant to the people of michigan i know they ve said there s cases where people think they ll come on quickly and within a day and they can crash and burn the night before my wife said he still had the cough wasn t feeling good and was a little bit weak he was just taking nyquil for a headache but she hadn t heard the rasping in his lungs when he talked i mean he was still sick but not being doctors we were thinking it was just a flu bug didn t know the extent and we don t have a stethoscope here not that i would know what to listen for anyways as the days wore on ben s condition wavered between improving and declining but by march 30 he still had a cough and a fever and felt it was time to talk to the doctor again in that second telemedicine appointment robert said ben s doctor told him he looked and sounded a little bit better she reiterated that the illness was likely caused by the flu and advised him to keep treating it at home thirteen hours later around 5 00 the next morning ben woke up with a terrible headache he was sweating and shaking his mom called 911 told ben to get dressed and woke up her husband when robert came out of his bedroom he saw his son had collapsed in a chair he joined his wife in performing cpr until the ambulance arrived i m actually a retired police officer so i understand how this works and as they were working on him i realized full well that they weren t going to transport to the hospital unless they got a heartbeat back just because of the conditions and they weren t able to bring him back at that time the bitterness we feel is that you know there s little doubt in my mind that if he had actually seen his doctor face to face where she could have taken his vitals and listened to his lungs that he would probably be alive today but for anybody out there that if you have it or if you think you do and you re self monitoring err on the side of caution and don t hesitate to get yourself looked at ben s autopsy revealed his lungs were filled with pneumonia caused by covid 19 according to robert who believes doctors reliance on telemedicine led to his son s death state senator lucido said he is now drafting legislation he calls ben s bill which he said would examine how michigan uses telemedicine there is a greater good with telemedicine but it depends on the case lucido said in covid 19 there was no telling what was going to happen and when it was going to happen which makes the difference after his son died robert kept coughing he went to the emergency room where doctors performed an x ray even though he was high risk and had a son who had died from the coronavirus robert said the doctors would not test him for covid 19 instead encouraged by his x ray results doctors sent him home to stay in quarantine we always said he was the life of the party not that he was a wild man but just because he would brighten up any room he went into so my advice is to live like ben live it to the fullest and be happy and spread the happiness because you just don t know when you can be taken away this disease is serious it doesn t discriminate it snatches you and stops your heart and you re done and people not taking it serious are going to be sorry i didn t know how serious this thing was until i actually experienced it firsthand and i witnessed this firsthand not once but twice this beast right here is really unbelievable none of us knew it started with a cough by the time covid 19 ran its course through joseph friday s life it had taken his mother his brother and his livelihood now he sits alone in the bronx apartment he used to share with his mother yvette judge and his brother matthew friday listening to news about the virus that forever changed his family before the cough joseph s life was that of a caregiver matthew had suffered multiple strokes and had issues with his heart and liver judge was a cancer survivor whose left side had been weakened by chemotherapy treatments joseph took them to doctor s appointments washed their clothes bought their food and counted out their medicine multiple times a day since june he had been paid to take care of matthew through new york s consumer directed personal assistance program cdpap funded through medicaid the program pays tens of thousands of new yorkers to care for their ailing loved ones so when he began seeing news articles about the new coronavirus joseph knew his brother s and mother s compromised immune systems put them both at risk then on march 20 matthew started coughing soon joseph and their mother were coughing too four days later matthew fell coming out of the bathroom he told joseph not to worry he had only tripped but the next day matthew fell again this time into the coffee table as joseph lifted him into a chair he saw his brother s hands were shaking once in the chair matthew could barely move joseph called 911 the ambulance came and took matthew to nearby st barnabas hospital where joseph said he told staff his brother had been coughing the next day just six days after matthew had begun coughing hospital staff called joseph to tell him his brother s heart had stopped and that he had tested positive for covid 19 i was telling my mother that she s looking sickly she was coughing and i m like oh my god we both got covid and there s nothing i could do at that moment because i know that her immune system was compromised so i know she didn t have too long so i was like let s go to the hospital then i thought about it and i said well the hospital was crowded the beds were full and she was like no i don t want to go back at the apartment judge was getting sicker two days after her son died she seemed disoriented joseph said he made her a cup of tea but when he handed it to her her hands were shaking so badly that she dropped it that night as joseph walked by his mother s room he saw her foaming at the mouth her muscles were stiff and she was having a hard time moving he said so he dialed 911 but judge stopped breathing before the ambulance arrived joseph said emergency responders worked on his mother for 20 minutes but were not able to revive her it would take another eight to nine hours he said before the medical examiner s office was able to pick up her body any time i had to pass her man i just kept breaking down this thing was tragedy man i know that i lost two family members to covid but then the medical examiner s office called and they said oh she died from something else i said well listen did they do a test for covid they said no she died from this and that i mean why wouldn t they do a test it s not a waste of money if you knew that someone in this house that had it and they both were well until they started coughing like come on both of them died from covid and i had symptoms also the first two weeks were really hard because it s just the memories i caught myself at first getting up preparing the medicines and just started breaking down i broke down for at least about a week and a half close to two weeks i was breaking down while joseph mourned his brother and mother he nursed his own symptoms he coughed his muscles ached he had diarrhea and no appetite although his self quarantine has now elapsed joseph mostly stays in his apartment for fear of transmitting the virus to someone else he also worries about his income his last cdpap check arrived on april 10 he said so his time is now spent trying to apply for unemployment insurance benefits he fills the rest of his days listening to the news he has heard reports of covid 19 sweeping through nursing homes around the country and worries about his brother anthony judge who lives in a nursing and rehabilitation home nearby unlike their mother anthony does not have life insurance if covid takes anthony too joseph said he would likely have to be buried in a mass grave in new york city s potter s field we didn t know that you could just get it by touching something or from a train or a bus but you know you can t cry over spilled milk there s nothing you can do about it the only thing you can do is cover up try to stay in try to help prevent the spread of this thing each housing unit should start distributing pamphlets they should start distributing masks you know just to get involved let people know that this thing is serious the young generation really don t get the picture here some people in the middle age generation don t get the picture this thing is real the first video above was produced and edited by will croxton the second video above was produced
