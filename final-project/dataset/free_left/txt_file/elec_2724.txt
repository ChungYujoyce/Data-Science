if you want to know why saturday s nevada caucus has suddenly in its final weeks turned from a presumed landslide for hillary clinton into a total toss up ask emily sandoval and maggie salas crespo or rather don t it s not that they re uninformed both sandoval and salas crespo are politically engaged they work for a small political consulting firm and are closely following the democratic primary but as of last week at least they were still in the uncomfortable position of not having made up their minds that is a very good question sandoval said squirming salas crespo nudged her you go first and sandoval sighed i m a little broken between bernie and hillary she said she struggled to explain why but her friend eric did it for her it s a struggle of head versus heart hillary clinton wasn t supposed to have to fight this hard for their votes their generational peers in iowa and new hampshire voted overwhelmingly from bernie sanders but they weren t expected to follow suit instead the clinton campaign expected nonwhite voters latinos in nevada and black voters in south carolina to provide hillary with a couple of easy wins after getting shellacked by sanders in blindingly white new hampshire that s not happening the race in nevada is neck and neck heading into saturday s caucuses and available polling suggests nonwhite voters are split between sanders and clinton young latinos who make up nearly half of nevada s latino voters don t have the rosy memories of the 1990s that helped drive clinton to victory with latinos across the country including in nevada in 2008 instead the president on their mind is obama they re still wrestling with his failure to keep his campaign promise to pass immigration reform and the record deportations of his first term but while they re not inclined to fall in line behind a candidate that represents the political establishment that disappointed them many are equally wary of falling in love with another candidate who promises to transform the political order the weight of choosing a candidate is heavy because in this as in all politics many young latinos carry the responsibility of choosing a candidate on behalf of their relatives and community members who can t vote in the days leading up to the caucuses they were still struggling to figure out who could be entrusted to protect them and the ones they love several latino and immigration advocacy groups have been pushing the trump effect the idea that donald trump has attracted so much attention for saying offensive things about immigrants that it will mobilize record numbers of latinos to the polls to vote against him that might be true with mr t in the mix it has sparked a lot more interest says salas crespo i have family members who ve been legal permanent residents green card holders for 30 years who had never thought of becoming citizens and voting now they re thinking about it salas crespo herself is part of a younger generation latinos under 30 whom university of nevada las vegas professor david damore describes as more politically engaged as compared to prior generations they make up nearly half of nevada s latino voters and many of them didn t need the trumpian wake up call furthermore saturday s caucuses throw into relief that it s not enough to vote against a candidate latinos can t vote against trump on saturday and no one i spoke with in nevada was inclined to caucus with the republicans to block him instead latino voters are looking assiduously for someone to vote for some of them have found it both the sanders and clinton campaigns have made significant efforts to reach out to latino voters of all ages sanders has a core of young latino volunteers who his campaign hopes will rally their community to a caucus victory and there s definitely some enthusiasm for clinton as well michael gonzalez a voter registration organizer says there are plenty of people who complete their registration forms hand them back to him and shout hillary as they walk away from his clipboard but most of the young latinos i talked to in nevada weren t yet able to get fully behind either candidate my biggest fear says jocelyn sida of the civic engagement group mi familia vota is that the mentality of latinos is going to be all about broken promises don t trust any candidate or campaign and just vote for the sake of it i want them to vote with purpose i want them to vote to support candidates and issues they re passionate on but sida s reference to broken promises is right on for many especially for young latinos many of whom came of political age during the obama administration the outgoing president is associated with the promise he made then broke on immigration reform as well as the deportations that took place in its stead when president obama went into office he was talking about immigration reforms says local activist and sanders supporter liz hernandez but still in 2016 i live in fear for my parents knowing that at any time they could be deported i m not saying obama hasn t done anything for us hernandez continues she herself got protection from deportation and work eligibility after obama s 2012 executive actions but that does not mean that i cannot be critical of the deportations that are happening now hernandez can t vote but both citizens and noncitizens i spoke to in nevada agreed members of the community who can vote bear the responsibility of voting on behalf of those who cannot young latinos take this responsibility especially seriously in a way that makes them less partisan than their older peers in 2014 asked why they voted by the polling firm latino decisions latinos as a whole were only slightly more likely to say they were voting to represent the community 37 percent as to support the democratic party 34 percent but among latinos under 35 only 28 percent said they d come out to support democrats 50 percent nearly twice as many were voting on the community s behalf so which of the two democrats running for president if either deserves to be entrusted to protect the latino community this is the question lurking behind the pre nevada caucus uncertainty and plenty of latinos simply aren t inclined to trust anyone people right now they doubt a lot of the candidates because of the last eight years says hernandez it s not that people are totally disengaged they re proactive in their skepticism using it to test the candidates people are more focused on actual actions on how they voted being more skeptical in some cases that skepticism is extending to the democratic party as a whole a lot of latino voters are inclined to vote republican this year more than 2008 diaz says at least to vote for republicans who are more non conservative on the other end of the spectrum aldo chavira a unlv student who wears bernie pins on his shirt and backpack says he might not bother to vote for the democratic nominee if it isn t sanders i feel like there isn t much difference between the parties now if he didn t win the nomination that d be one of the last times that you could vote for somebody honest liz hernandez doesn t go so far as to say that both parties are the same but she also believes sanders s anti establishment cred makes him the anti political politician latinos are seeking because he offers hope diaz sees it differently that falling in love with sanders is making the same mistake all over again when i hear bernie sanders talk about certain immigration points it reminds me of obama like i ve heard that before i want to hear something different of course it s hard to judge candidates based on their actions in the midst of a presidential candidacy which is all about words but some latinos are making their decisions based on how well they feel the candidates are reaching out to their community how much in other words their vote and input is being valued because of outreach i m leaning toward clinton says diaz i feel like she s been trying to keep people more involved on the other hand another young latina who asked not to be named said that she d only been contacted on behalf of the sanders campaign by a woman who spoke in passionate and fluent spanish it was amazing alternatively they can judge by how well the candidates respond when they re called out for their inevitable shortcomings we always have to be vigilant says astrid silva of the group dream vegas silva isn t eligible to vote but she s endorsed hillary clinton we gave her a lot of the criticisms we had and of all the candidates she handled it the best most young latinos don t have the luxury of sitting down and grilling the candidates but silva s attitude of engaged skepticism is pretty common among her peers i work a lot with the youth says emily sandoval searching for the right euphemism she adds you see more of an innocent essence in what they would like to see in this country in a primary election that s been defined by a generation gap as much as anything else you might associate that sort of pragmatism with the over 45 voters drawn to hillary clinton sandoval who was undecided as of last week is in her mid 20s she has only voted for one president before but paying close personal attention to the obama administration s failures and limitations over the past eight years has made her especially wary of candidates who appeal to her heart freddy garcia is even younger he really is one of those first time voters at a mock caucus on saturday he was also undecided saying he had to do some research on the candidates immigration positions before making up his mind when his fellow mock caucus attendee also a latino and first time voter declared his support for sanders he started evangelizing not so subtly to garcia the actual mock caucus hadn t started yet and it was using fake candidates anyway but garcia was getting a taste of the real caucus it s time for change the sanders supporter said people keep saying he s not going to do that change but they re the naysayers if you believe the change it will happen garcia sighed literally every candidate in history has promised change he said he sat sideways in his chair
