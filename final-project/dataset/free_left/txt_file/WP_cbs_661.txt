the following is a transcript of the interview with national economic council director larry kudlow that aired sunday june 30 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan we turn now to larry kudlow the national economic council director who joins us this morning from connecticut larry good to have you here the president said he s not increasing tariffs on china and he s allowing american companies to do business with huawei that essentially throws that tech firm a lifeline what did the u s get for these concessions larry kudlow well let s first of all the talks are going to restart i think that s a very big deal right there no timeline margaret but they are going to restart look regarding the huawei story let me just try to clarify that there will be sales from american companies but but only in the sense of the general merchandise things that are available in other places around the world anything to do with national security concerns will not receive a new license from the commerce department i think that s very important i think people have to understand that stuff that s generally available will be will be probably getting a temporary license from the commerce department we ll see how far that goes second point is we are hoping and expecting that china will engage in large scale purchases of american farm products and farm services as the talks continue the talks may not be ending the talks may not even be solved but the president believes that china will begin to purchase american agriculture and that s going to be a big boost to our farmers and that would be a good faith show that these are serious talks and negotiations margaret brennan but on those purchases that you say might happen in the meantime the existing tariffs still stay in place so that means the retaliatory tariffs are too and even with this announcement of china potentially buying more product according to the usda that market for soybean farmers won t recover until 2026 or 2027 they re losing markets the longer this goes on so how much damage can america stomach kudlow well look that may be i don t want to forecast that we ll see if china steps in to fill the void our farmers have been terrific they re patriots they support the president s dealings with china pres strongest president we ve ever had in us china relations china s problems you know ip theft forced transfers of technology problems with getting into cloud services problems with tariffs problems with non tariff barriers all these things are going to have to be addressed and that s the only way it ll help the american economy it s a very unbalanced trading relationship margaret as you may know that has to be fixed it s not going to be 50 50 they have many more remedies and correctives to make and that s what president trump said in his news conference and elsewhere in this recent trip to japan now having said that with respect to the farmers we are doing the best we can we are providing short term assistance to keep them going and try to fill the void until we can get better international markets the farmers themselves the farm groups they ve been great patriots and we we celebrate their support to make america s overall economy very very strong and let s see if the chinese make good on this promise that ll have a bearing you know the president said on tariffs let me make this point he said no additional tariffs for now so he s going good faith to see how these talks go to see if china delivers on an early agriculture promise let s call it an early harvest but that may be up for grabs we will see no one can predict with certainty margaret brennan but but last time my understanding is the talks were going well and then china backed off of a perceived promise to change its laws so is there any indication from china that they will make the kind of structural change to their own laws to make good on some of the changes you want to see happen on ip et cetera kudlow you re right about the problem and they did pull back from some agreements we thought we had and by the by that also includes all manner of enforcement to whatever conditions are made so you re quite right can i sit here and tell you that s all going to work out no we don t know that the teams are going to start negotiating in earnest ambassador lighthizer secretary mnuchin and others but we don t know margaret brennan okay kudlow this is just a new first step i always think it s better to talk than not to talk margaret brennan sure kudlow we have no assurances and again the president himself said several times we want quality talks there is no timeline here the issue is quality not speed margaret brennan well kudlow so we will see if china delivers on some of these significant reforms margaret brennan marco rubio has been raising concerns though about what the president just agreed to do with huawei that tech firm he said if president trump has bargained away recent restrictions on huawei then the u s congress will put them back in via legislation isn t this undercutting the president s negotiation and why would the u s allow american companies to do business with a firm that is working on surveillance and a national security threat kudlow well look again i i i think senator rubio s concerns about all manner of national security are correct they re proper concerns and i hope that when president trump comes back that he and others of us will be able to persuade senator rubio that there will be no national security violations that any additional licensing from the commerce department to american companies will be for what we call general merchandise not national security sensitive general merchandise meaning you know various chips and software and other services that are available all around the world not specific to the u s but the president is not backing off on the national security concerns we understand the huge risks regarding huawei and let me say the president several times we will fully address huawei not until the end of the trade talks in other words margaret brennan right kudlow that will come last and that will deal you know with much larger issues concerning the long term future with huawei so that s what what s happening now is simply a a loosening up for general merchandise maybe some additional licenses from commerce it is not the last word the last word is not going to come till the very end of the talks this is a complicated matter so i hope we ll be able to persuade senator rubio and others that that that we are as cautious and concerned as they are margaret brennan all right larry kudlow thank you so much we ll be back in one minute with a lot more face the nation don t go away watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the
