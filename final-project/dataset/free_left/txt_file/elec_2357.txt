for 21st century conservatives fear is not an authentic feeling of actual concern for your safety but an ideological pose struck to justify the darker more sadistic urges that motivate the republican base in our day and age declaring you want war for the pleasure of conquest or that you support racist policies out of unvarnished bigotry is socially unacceptable so fear is donned as a costumeto conceal the hate the shivering coward is a more sympathetic figure than the snarling bigot and so no matter how laughably implausible their posture of fear is conservatives will strike it no where is this more obvious than in the republican town halls and ralliesthat have taken over iowa in the run up to the primary jeremy peters of the new york times paints a picture of candidates and voters gathering together to act like they re huddled in a bunker while the germans blitzkrieg london this despairing tone was on display monday as republicans crisscrossed the country on the first full day of campaigning in the new year he writes and began airing commercials that had a singular and sometimes fearsome focus on national security donald trump of course is grabbing all sorts of headlines with his first campaign ad that wallows in unbelievable levels of racism conflating mexicans with moroccans and assuming that they all mean us ill ted cruz is literally using this as an opportunity to play at being clint eastwood as peters reports going slightly off script and off topic mr cruz also invoked a little gallows humor after someone s phone rang with the whistling theme from clint eastwood s the good the bad and the ugly i will say this to everyone in washington mr cruz said misquoting another classic eastwood western when you hang a man make sure to hang em high chris christie is ramping up the rhetoric about how we live in dangerous perilous times and jeb bush despite his claims to be the grown up in all this put out an ad declaring that we are at war with radical islamic terrorism while trying to scare the rubes with pictures of the isis flag and machine guns even marco rubio who tends to play at being a genial guy is all about pretending the barbarians are at the gates these days when america needed a bold plan of action from our commander in chief we instead got a lecture on love tolerance and gun control designed to please the talking heads at msnbc rubio said in a speech on monday the result of all of this is that people are afraid and they have every right to be the right to be afraid is an interesting concept if fear is an authentic emotion to have a right to have it is neither here nor there fear simply is this permission offered by rubio is less about allowing authentic feeling and more of a gesture to the pageantry of all this a way of saying the curtain is up and it s time for everyone to play their roles to mimic the fear that justifies the hatred and irrationality all of which makes perfect sense given the geography of this fear pageantry islamic terrorism is real of course no one actually denies this as much as republicans would like you to believe otherwise but the likelihood of being hurt by it while living in iowa ranks well below the risk of being killed by a horse kicking you in the head islamic terrorist attacks are generally rare in the u s butwhen they do happen it s in urban areas boston new york paris even san bernardino is still enmeshed in the suburban sprawl out of los angeles thewhole point of a terrorist strike is to cause maximum mayhem with minimal resources you don t get that shooting up a parking lot in des moines i mean never say never but the already low odds of being attacked this way get comically low when we re talking iowa but none of that matters of course because the fear of islamic terrorism is not a deeply held terror actually keeping most who claim to have it up late at night on the contrary it seems in this country anyway that the claim to fear islamic terrorism isinversely proportional to the distance between your house and a place that might actually be hit by it either we have a serious mental health crisis going on in our country with all these paranoid delusions or people are just play acting this emotion for ideological purposes david brooks in his tuesday column for the new york times tries valiantlyto shape this affectation of fear into something slightly more logical by trying to roll upthe risk of your typical mass shooting as well as other kinds of violence in a great big bundle with islamic terrorism in israel there s the wave of stabbings in this country we have shooting sprees in schools and in theaters in cities there are police killings in other places there are suicide bombings this violence is the daily diet of the global news channels nice try dude but that dog won t hunt the samefolks play acting fear of islamic terrorism in cedar falls do not generally think that police violence is something they have to worry about in right wing circles mass shootings that aren tislamic terrorism which are the vast majority of them tend to be treated more as gun shopping opportunitiesand moments to pull faces about mental health before moving on and acting like it never happened this more than anything shows how the fear on display in republican circles truly is a pose no matter where you live in the u s but especially if you live in heavily conservative areas if someone comes into a public place to start shooting it up the odds are exponentially higher that this person is some 20 year old malcontent or some middle aged manhyped up on misogynist propaganda than that they are an islamic terrorist any conclusions drawn from that fact are ideologically uncomfortable for conservatives if you focus on the how it happened the conclusion is that tighter gun control will prevent some of these mass shootings but focusing on the why isn t much easier for the right most mass shooters of any age tend to be men whose grievances stem directly from the same thwarted sense of male entitlement to women s attention or to status that fox news and company stoke day in and day out for political gain since none of the solutions are acceptable to the right the problem of mass shootings is treated by and large as an unavoidable tragedy and not something to really be that afraid of at all but terrorism at least islamic terrorism islamic terrorism is politically useful something the bush administration figured out nicely by creating a terror alert system that former dhs head tom ridge has publicly stated was used to manipulate the polls in favor of george w bush it laid down a patter that is being revived by republican candidates today they pretend to be worried the voters pretend to be afraid and the votes keep rolling in meanwhile actual problems that really should worry voters such as global warming economic insecurity and yes even ordinary mass shootings and other kinds of gun violence are denied or pointedly ignored because fear at least on the right is not an authentic feeling but a costume to be donned or discarded out of political necessity amanda marcotte is a politics writer for salon who covers
