games the university of staffordshire last year launched its bachelor s and master s esports programs in which students mainly learn marketing and management skills tailored to the industry this autumn it s expanding the program to london while other schools are also debuting esports degree courses including britain s chichester university in asia where esports has seen strong growth schools

taking it a step further by adding courses as the industry s boom drives demand for professionals who know how to for example organize esports tournaments new niche degrees partly highlight the changing economy but they also reflect the need to communicate to parents and students that there will be a job waiting for someone once they earn a degree which may include hefty tuition fees and student loans to pay for them said joni finney director of the university of pennsylvania s institute for research on higher education she worried that some degrees are too specialized and that some schools are launching them to offset falling enrollment it s really up to the faculty of those institutions to step up and say you know a degree in business will cover these kinds of jobs rather than saying we have a degree in a certain job category finney said becker college formally launched its bachelor of science in esports management this month after an initial soft release last year it s no longer kids playing games in their basement said alan ritacco dean of becker college s school of design and technology the top esports players now earn almost as much as the highest paid stars in traditional sports like golf or tennis he said the schools emphasize that their courses aren t about just playing video games people are unaware of the industry that goes behind esports said matt huxley a lecturer at staffordshire university s digital institute london a new outpost the university near birmingham england opened so students could be closer to game companies in the british capital huxley who teaches a class on organizing tournaments said learning about esports was akin to studying sports management if you were to go and study to be a director of football you re not playing football you re learning the business behind how player transfers work how you run a stadium and all those kind of operational things chichester university hired former pro gamer rams singh known as r2k as a senior lecturer for its program which includes playing games such as fifa and league of legends as part of the course ohio state is poised to launch an esports and game studies undergraduate major that will include the application of games to health and medicine a business focus helps to ease worries among students and parents about paying tuition for degrees that have no track record in britain standard tuition fees are set at 9 250 pounds 11 430 a year while the u s programs charge as much as 36 000 a year there s always going to be risks but i have zero regrets said ellis celia 26 who is also starting the staffordshire course the industry can only go up at this point she said first published on october 1 2019 9 13 am 2019 the associated press all rights reserved
