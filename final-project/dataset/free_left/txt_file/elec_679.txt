com lainxyvg2n the bid comes 3 1 2 months after a narrow loss for senate in texas a campaign that catapulted the 46 year old three term lawmaker from el paso to national prominence o rourke is heading to iowa for several campaign events including a stop at northern iowa university to stump for eric giddens who is running for a special election for a state senate seat at the end of the month on march 30 o rourke plans to return to el paso to kick off his campaign the former congressman had been testing the waters for a presidential run in unconventional ways he took a solo road trip through the southwest earlier this year documenting his travels in a series of medium posts reminiscent of jack kerouac he used instagram and facebook to stream conversations with people in his neighborhood and life including a now famous stop at the dentist on the day of president trump s state of the union address to congress in february o rourke sat down for an interview with oprah winfrey and said he was thinking about running for president and when mr trump visited el paso last month to talk about border security o rourke held a dueling rally that captured the attention of the current commander in chief o rourke has an influential social media presence and demonstrated a grassroots fundraising prowess in his unsuccessful senate bid raising a whopping 80 million he collected endorsements in that race from the likes of beyonce and lebron james fueling interest from the national media and drawing comparisons to john f kennedy he has the potential to tap into various constituencies and as the el paso rally demonstrated a willingness to take on the president the nominating process will test whether o rourke can translate that kind of support and star power to a different kind of campaign one in which he ll be competing against other popular democrats not an opponent like republican sen ted cruz the white house run will also prompt greater scrutiny of his policy proposals and track record in congress in an interview with the washington post in january o rourke struggled to define his solutions for key immigration issues even though he represented a district along the border in an interview with msnbc last month he said he would support taking down an existing border wall in el paso on wednesday just hours before his presidential announcement vanity fair published a cover story profile of o rourke complete with photos by legendary photographer annie leibovitz in an interview for the piece the former congressman talked about his presidential ambitions i want to be in it he told the magazine man i m just born to be in it and want to do everything i humanly can for this country at this moment the born to be in it comment has already garnered some backlash on social media as issues of inequality and privilege are being debated in what is already the most crowded and diverse democratic primary field in recent history o rourke addressed criticism he would likely face as a white male in a field that already comprises women african americans a latino and a gay millennial the government at all levels is overly represented by white men he told vanity fair that s part of the problem and i m a white man so if i were to run i think it s just so important that those who would comprise my team looked like this country he continued but i totally understand people who will make a decision based on the fact that almost every single one of our presidents has been a white man and they want something different for this country and i think that s a very legitimate basis upon which to make a decision especially in the fact that there are some really great candidates out there right now cbs this morning co anchor gayle king will speak with o rourke for
