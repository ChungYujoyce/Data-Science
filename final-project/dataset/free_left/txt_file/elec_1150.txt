i spent the weekend talking to roy moore supporters in alabama here s how they see the world when beverly nelson told her story on cnn about the night in the 1970s when she says roy moore sexually assaulted her her voice quavered and tears streamed down her face instead of stopping he began squeezing my neck nelson said to force my head onto his crotch laughter breaks out around me i m at a community center in opelika alabama in an office where residents are trickling in to register to vote i came here to meet roy moore supporters and to play this youtube clip of nelson to understand what they saw in it to them it was an amusing performance of a political plant a liar or at least an embellisher crying crocodile tears tuesday s senate special election in alabama will be one of the most closely watched of the year democrat doug jones has gotten into striking distance of beating moore the republican who has been accused of harassing assaulting and pursuing several underage women when he was in his 30s with the rising tide of women stepping forward to name the powerful men who allegedly harmed them in the past many of the men sen al franken rep john conyers and journalist mark halperin among them are resigning or being fired but roy moore has retained the backing of president donald trump and the republican national committee and his fate lies in the hands of voters the big question in the race will enough alabama voters dismiss the allegations against moore to elect him to the senate or will doug jones seize this metoo moment and become the first democrat to win a statewide election in alabama in nearly a decade if moore wins it will feel a lot like the 2016 election in miniature trump won the presidency despite a damning video where he admitted to groping women without their permission the dynamics at play in alabama are familiar in other ways republicans there might elect moore to office simply because they don t trust his accusers or the media reporting their stories a recent cbs news yougov poll found that 71 percent of alabama republicans don t believe the allegations which include moore pursuing a girl who was 14 when he was in his 30s other voters are just unwilling to allow a democrat to hold a senate seat in deep red alabama and it doesn t help that the conservative media is spreading outright conspiracy theories as vox s jane coaston has written for the past few years i ve been reporting on political psychology probing the scientific theories about how voters think and why they don t offer perfect explanations but they do hint at the kinds of instincts that today s politicians and media can exploit once we ve picked our team once we know what we fear about the opponents our minds reorient the world to protect those thoughts what i heard in that opelika meeting house room and what i heard from conservatives in other parts of the state provided a window into why here s the first thing to know about political psychology when we re deeply loyal to a team we see the world differently in sports penalties are always the other team s fault it s called motivated reasoning and we often don t realize we re doing it we automatically have an easier time remembering information that fits our worldviews we re quicker to recognize information that confirms what we already know which makes us blind to facts that discount it it s not just a republican phenomenon this is the tragedy of politics liberals are also widely susceptible to conspiracy theories some liberals rushed to overlook allegations of groping against franken so one crucial reason why moore s most adamant supporters don t see a scandalized politician is that they see a folk hero he s our johnny appleseed our davy crockett says thomas sparrow who works on the moore campaign as a volunteer moore rose to fame as an elected chief justice of the alabama supreme court who was twice removed from office for defying orders from higher courts the first time he defied an order to remove a large statue of the ten commandments from the state supreme court building then he refused to recognize the supreme court s decision legalizing same sex marriage moore knew we don t accept the court as the final authority sara jane tatum 59 of opelika says and for that his supporters are grateful and filled with admiration for moore s detractors his actions were an unconstitutional grandiose self serving stunt that s what the us district court that ruled against moore s ten commandments display felt if all chief justice moore had done were to emphasize the ten commandments historical and educational importance this court would have a much different case before it the court ruling read but the chief justice went far far beyond he installed a two and a half ton monument in the most prominent place in a government building with the specific purpose and effect of establishing a permanent recognition of the sovereignty of god and that is a clear infraction of the establishment clause of the first amendment ann bennett a third generation alabama republican living in opelika has a very different view she says moore s actions were like the biblical figures shadrach meshach and abednego who refused to bow down to and worship a golden statue of a king and were thrown into a furnace for their disobedience roy moore has to be one of the highest integrity people who have ever entered politics she says who else gives up the most powerful positions in the state of alabama and the money that came with it at one point she joked that moore may be far too ethical for the senate though don t mistake her for a person incapable of criticizing republicans she once worked in tennessee to prevent legalized gambling and here comes this casino operator and i m supposed to vote for him he was on the cover of playboy during the primary she wanted to stop trump her eventual vote for him she says was mostly a vote against hillary clinton who would bring the end of america with more liberal justices who would make rulings that many evangelicals abhor on issues like same sex marriage and abortion there s some irony here in that a lot of people see moore as bennett once saw trump an immoral alleged predator taking advantage of republican politics but it s just so hard to see someone you admire be smeared it hurts to see them fall could that be a fear here i asked her could the pain of recognizing that moore did something immoral be steering you away from taking these accusations credibly bennett turned it around what happened to roy moore is the scariest thing in the world she says that any of us could live a life of complete integrity and have your name ruined forever and then have your name ruined with false allegations why do we have motivated reasoning in the first place it s frustrating and illogical and it makes conflicts intractable the leading theory is that we often see our group identity as being part of our individual identity when there s a threat to the group it s a threat to the self when our self feels attacked our brain is going to bring to bear the same defenses that it has for protecting the body jonas kaplan a psychologist at the university of southern california told me earlier this year it s like we have an immune system for uncomfortable thoughts and you can see it working in real time trying to sort out why a damning piece of evidence might not be so bad after all in the cnn clip nelson says moore locked the door when she protested this is ridiculous my companions in opelika said the only way you can t get out of a locked door is with child proof locks bennett says and child proof locks didn t exist in the 70s but he was larger than her i say he could have forced her to stay inside regardless exactly bennett says if he wanted to do anything he would have done it she says if he was turned on he would have done it he s strong he was into martial arts he would have done it he would have raped her the fact that moore didn t rape her nelson does not allege rape that he relented is proof enough i asked is there anything that would make you believe nelson a blue dress she said referring to monica lewinsky s infamous semen stained garment there are endless ways to cast doubt on moore s accusers stories or to diminish them why did these women wait decades to come forward why did these allegations only come out in the weeks before the elections back in the 70s plenty of older men dated teenagers i was told plenty of vietnam veterans like roy moore came back to the united states and forgot their manners around women for other voters i talked to it seemed like the discomfort they felt about the possibility of a democrat winning the senate seat led them to find ways to avoid thinking about the evidence against moore yes these women should be believed but so should roy moore caleb parker 34 a birmingham resident and member of the greater birmingham young republicans says he doesn t see moore as folk hero but he does see him as a republican a member of his party that he ought to support this whole convicting people in the court of public opinion is a scary thing for this country to be doing it s better to stay above he said she said arguments but it s not he said she said i pointed out it s he said she said she said she said people dogpile on people all the time and it s not true parker says mentioning the 2006 case where a woman brought false rape allegations against duke lacrosse players he also doesn t like that franken is stepping down amid groping allegations i do not like al franken i do not agree with what he did but running people out on allegations alone without a trial is a scary place for this country to be in it s also important to mention that moore s candidacy has broken some republicans out of a stubborn partisan mindset alabama s senior senator republican richard shelby told cnn i couldn t vote for roy moore if elected moore faces investigation and possible expulsion from members of his own party plenty of republicans will be sitting out the vote or writing in a different candidate which means moore has brought the state to the brink of something unthinkable just a few months ago electing a democratic senator to me moore s tenure at the alabama supreme court doesn t indicate good christian philosophy it seems to be self aggrandizement says michael bullington 23 a member of the greater birmingham young republicans a group that publicly withdrew support from moore bullington was especially put off by moore s refusal to agree to the higher court s ruling on the ten commandments display there s no way to be an alabama supreme court judge without recognizing there are other judges that have authority over you he says and that s the basis of our judicial system the way that he twists it that he s fighting this grand crusade that s not right for me throughout history people have always interpreted political stories in different ways here s what s changed today there are more structures technologies and social norms in place to further wedge us apart there s a conservative media ecosystem built to fortify the conservative worldview there s facebook whose algorithms make sure we may never have to read an opposing viewpoint reality is fracturing around partisan lines and the divides seem to only be growing deeper we ll remain blind to it because it s much easier to spot bias in another person than it is to recognize it in yourself one auburn alabama resident supporting moore told me i might be biased but i m right and then there s trump throwing gasoline on this motivated reasoning engine trump in trying to combat the media delegitimized the media and has created an environment in which conspiracy theory is normalized asheley landrum a texas tech university psychologist who studied motivated reasoning says and that s not to mean that everyone is a conspiracy theorist and that people who believe in conspiracy theories are dumb believing in conspiracy theories psychological research informs us is a coping mechanism to deal with uncertainty in the world it s a self protective mechanism people have jan willem van prooijen a psychologist who studies conspiracy theories told me earlier in the year when conservatives say they believed hillary clinton would have represented the end of america they believe it wins for democrats mean more liberal judges who will rule on social matters like same sex marriage and abortion that they fear will continue to degrade the country when they say they want to take america back they re fearful that rising immigration will threaten their status in the country they re scared and the denials of misconduct around roy moore are tinged with conspiracy theory how else should we describe arguments made by moore backers that someone maybe george soros must be paying these women these theories have none the proof moore backers are demanding of his accusers they re compelling nonetheless and becoming harder to debunk a recent poynter survey found just 19 percent of republicans have confidence in the media and that almost half of americans 44 percent indicate that they believe the news media fabricates stories about president trump more than once in a while on friday reality around roy moore fractured again news broke that nelson added a note underneath where roy moore signed her high school yearbook she offered the signature as evidence moore knew her when she was a teenager in one view this means nothing so what she added the date and location of where the yearbook had been signed through the looking glass the conservative media took this to mean nelson admitted to forging the signature itself and i fear this fracturing will continue if moore is elected members of his own party have said they d start an ethics investigation and possibly vote to expel him from the senate i am so angry at the thought that they might not seat him bennett says that is like civil war stuff for me get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
