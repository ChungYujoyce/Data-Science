fees at a senate hearing on wednesday senator maria cantwell of washington the ranking democrat on the commerce science and transportation committee singled out united airlines delta air lines and jetblue for their decisions to cut employee hours mandatory or forced reductions in payroll hours is not what the cares act intended she said referring to the stimulus law passed in march which authorized 50 billion to help airlines continue operating during the coronavirus pandemic half of that funding was intended to pay employees through september provided airlines refrained from cutting pay or laying off staff united on wednesday reversed a plan that would have made thousands of full time workers into part timers a union representing thousands of united employees sued the airline over the plan on tuesday the company said the lawsuit was meritless executives from united and other airlines did not take part in the hearing the airlines were represented by the chief executive of the trade group airlines for america nicholas e calio he said airlines were doing whatever they could to survive the duration and breadth of the impacts directly on our industry compounded by the larger economy leave no doubt that the u s airline industry will emerge a shadow of what it was on march 1 of this year mr calio said that did not satisfy democrats who said the industry s practices around refunds were misleading or deceptive many airlines have been encouraging travelers to take vouchers for future travel instead of cash government figures due friday will undoubtedly show that job losses in april were the worst ever but they could provide key hints about the recovery economists surveyed by marketwatch expect the labor department report to show that u s payrolls fell by 22 million jobs last month a decade s worth of job gains wiped out in weeks the payroll processing company adp on wednesday said that the private sector lost more than 20 million jobs in april with the cuts spread across every sector and size of employer it s no surprise that employers have cut millions of jobs weekly data on filings for unemployment benefits released every thursday have tracked the destruction but the monthly numbers due on friday are more comprehensive than the weekly ones which almost certainly understate the damage friday s report could also help answer a question that could be crucial to the eventual recovery how far has the damage spread if the losses are concentrated in sectors that have been directly affected by the virus like retail and services that were hit by stay at home orders that could bode well for the recovery because it suggests the damage has been contained but if it has spread to industries like finance and professional services that could suggest a cascade effect is underway with laid off workers pulling back on spending leading to lost revenues and still more layoffs it could take much longer to climb out of that kind of hole trump
