watch cbsn live november 20 2019 6 21 am cbs news in this episode of the intelligence matters podcast host michael morell speaks with sue mi terry senior fellow for korea at the center for strategic and international studies a former senior cia analyst terry explains why the u s north korea talks are at a stalemate after months of negotiations and three historic summits between president trump and chairman kim jong un terry tells morell kim has not taken a single step toward denuclearization nor has he made the strategic decision to renounce his nuclear weapons program all while continuing to test shorter range missiles terry also outlines concerns about regional proliferation and the prospects of arriving at an interim nuclear deal before the 2020 election intelligence matters sue mi terry correspondent michael morell producer olivia gazis michael morell sue welcome back to intelligence matters it s great to have you back on the show this is your third time with us tying a record you re actually competing with your colleague from csis that s chris johnson laugh for most on the podcast but it s great to have you back sue mi terry great thanks for having me michael morell sue i wanted to have you on the show to give our listeners an update on north korea there is a lot that s going on in the world from impeachment and elections here at home to tension with iran and turkey abroad and north korea s fallen off the front pages there s not that much discussion about it at the moment so i thought it important that at least we here on intelligence matters and our listeners not lose sight of what is an extraordinarily important issue so that s what i d love to do and maybe the place to start sue is to remind us kind of how we got from where we were at the end of the obama administration to where we are today how would you tell the arc of that story sue mi terry when president trump first came into the office president obama first told president trump that north korea is going to be the number one security issue and it turned out to be true in 2017 north korea conducted many tests including three icbm tests intercontinental ballistic missile tests which the united states from the us s perspective used to always say that s the threshold because now they have a missile that can reach new york or washington they also conducted nuclear tests with a hydrogen bomb test it was a very powerful test and so if you remember in 2017 the trump administration was pursuing what they called a maximum pressure policy and along with a fire and fury rhetoric and calling kim a rocket man on a suicide mission michael morell and the maximum sue mi terry and all of that michael morell pressure was largely sanctions sue mi terry largely sanctions and to the trump administration s credit i do think they got countries like china to actually implement sanctions and for a skeptic like myself and a lot of korea watchers that was a genuine surprise that by fall of 2017 we had china implementing sanctions because in the previous administrations china was a little bit lax let s say in terms of implementing sanctions so we were in full on maximum pressure stage with north korea in response to their nuclear tests and missile tests michael morell do you think china was helpful in that situation because they were worried sue mi terry yes michael morell about the tension on the peninsula sue mi terry absolutely i do think china s favorite saying with the korean peninsula is no war no instability no nukes and in that order and i think with maximum pressure with this fire and fury rhetoric china was concerned about potential instability in the korean peninsula potential conflict if you remember it was also a time when we were talking about a potential preventive strike on north korea a bloody nose strategy pursuing that strategy south koreans were so alarmed about all of this so that was 2017 and then all of a sudden in 2018 we have kim jong un s new year editorial that sort of indicated maybe north korea was shifting to sort of the charm offensive phase because north korea said you know what we re done with our testing we re going to now try to focus on economic development and then president moon moon jae in of south korea played a pivotal role in terms of sort of saying it s time for diplomacy invited the north koreans to participate in the pyeongchang olympics winter olympics in south korea and president trump responded to all this by saying i m going to meet with kim jong un michael morell why do you think kim jong un made that shift in that new year speech sue mi terry kim is very interesting he s a very shrewd guy that move also caught many korea watchers off guard because he was about 90 95 done with north korea s nuclear program he has demonstrated an icbm capability because they have tested three times intercontinental ballistic missiles he just conducted a hydrogen nuclear test and i think he felt comfortable in terms of where they were in their nuclear missile program and that he didn t feel the need to go all the way to show 100 capability in terms of being able to strike new york city with a nuclear weapon or washington dc right the north koreans had a little more to go in terms of showing that capability militarization capability i think most korea watchers thought north koreans were there but they needed to showcase a successful reentry capability they had a couple more things steps to do but he stopped he didn t need to go 100 he said this is good enough i m going to stop here so i think the combination of getting north korea s nuclear missile program to where he wanted it and then sort of saying i m not going to push it further because of all this bloody nose talk that s coming out of washington so i think it s a combination of reasons that have made him pivot to charm offensive sending the north korean athletes to the south korean olympics and then proposing meeting with trump and president trump of course said i want to meet with kim it s not true that president obama or president bush were so dying to meet with the north korean leader it was active policy where previous us presidents didn t want to give that kind of legitimacy to a north korean leader by sitting down with him i think president trump said kim called president obama how many times and obama begged president obama begged to meet with kim jong un that s not true neither president obama nor president bush wanted to meet with a north korean leader because that would be giving legitimacy to the leader but president trump obviously was not concerned about that wanted to sit down with kim so then we had the historic singapore summit where president trump met with kim jong un then we also had the hanoi summit which obviously didn t work out because north koreans came in with such an ask what they asked for basically is almost all lifting of unsc united nations security council sanctions that are placed on north korea and then they met again briefly at the dmz in the korean peninsula president trump and the leader of north korean kim jong un and then just recently the working level talks were held in stockholm that fell apart so basically since the singapore summit despite the singapore declaration despite north korea saying they would work towards peace in the korean peninsula and denuclearization of the korean peninsula despite president trump saying right after the singapore summit that the north korean threat is over we are at a stalemate north korean threat is not over they have not taken a single step towards denuclearization and that s where we are michael morell let me ask you a question about president clinton because at the end of the second clinton administration president clinton had signaled his willingness to go to north korea it didn t happen at the end of the day but he had signaled his willingness to go how do you think about that compared to what president trump did sue mi terry the order is very important there because president clinton signaled his willingness to go to north korea because we had a 1994 agreed framework we had a bilateral agreement with north korea and that was towards the end of the administration that he was thinking about going and of course he sent his secretary of state former secretary of state madeleine albright to pyongyang and it s just that they ran out of time but there was a deal in place and at the time the us did not know that north koreans were actually sort of cheating on that framework agreement at the time i don t think president clinton knew that so his willingness to visit came at the end of that whole there was a negotiation there was an agreement it s many years later whereas with president trump nothing has worked out right there were no working level talks that were held where there was an agreement president trump thought only if he could just sit down with kim jong un they could somehow hammer out a deal so it s michael morell backwards sue mi terry a very backward approach michael morell so sue we re at a stalemate what s the underlying problem what s the underlying dynamic that doesn t allow any sort of serious negotiation to go forward sue mi terry most fundamentally i don t think kim has made the strategic decision to give up his nuclear weapons program i think it s pretty clear now i was hoping before the singapore summit that maybe just maybe kim is truly different from his father and grandfather in that regard but i don t think he has made t he strategic decision to give it up then there s the actual problem of sequencing so even if you give him that remotest possibility which i don t think he has made that decision but even if you allow yourself to say okay maybe kim has made that decision he just doesn t want to give up everything up front we re not asking for that but there s a sequencing problem because what the north koreans are saying is that the united states has to lift most of the sanctions before they can take the first step towards denuclearization and obviously what the united states is saying sanctions the only real leverage that we have and if we would lift most of the sanctions why would kim have any incentive to give it up so i think there s a sequencing problem there s also distrust with each other north koreans also don t trust us because they have experience with the clinton years there was a great framework bill clinton almost went to pyongyang time ran out president bush came in sort of reversed the policy so they kind of point to that and then they point to the us being a democracy and we have a change of administration and we re not going to be actually keeping our word that they can really trust us and of course from the us s perspective we cannot trust north korea we have a long history of dealing with north korea we had many agreements with north korea right we had 1994 agreement framework and during the bush years we had the whole six party talks and so we had a 2005 agreement 2007 we had a joint statement and every single time everything fell apart over verification so even after there s an agreement there s a fundamental distrust there s a sequencing issue and at the core i don t think north korea is interested in giving up nuclear weapons michael morell so he hasn t made up his mind to do that do you think he s open to the idea do you think he debates it in his mind or is this no way no how or is there more going on here do you think is he actually thinking about it i know that s a really tough question sue mi terry i think that s a very tough question and really serious korea scholars can debate this and we do debate this is my personal assessment i don t think kim will do that i don t think he has made up his mind to that and i don t see why he would do that north korea is a nuclear weapons power north korea is not libya what libya was it s not afghanistan north korea has up to 60 nuclear warheads they have intercontinental ballistic missiles they believe nuclear weapons are the true deterrent the only deterrent against the united states and everybody knows north koreans want regime survival and nuclear weapons are a deterrent against the united states and potential threat to north korea so why would you give it up some people point to the fact that kim jong un is a young man that he ll actually want to develop north korea economically i buy that of course he does but from a north korean perspective they can have nuclear weapons and they can develop their country so if he s eating his cake or having it what s the phrase laugh right he can do both why does he have to give up nuclear weapons so i really have a hard time believing that north korea will ever give up nuclear weapons michael morell so we ve had this stalemate and they haven t tested any more nuclear weapons or they haven t tested any more icbms they ve done some tests of shorter range missiles but are they still advancing in their capabilities on the nuclear weapons side and the icbm side during the stalemate or not sue mi terry yes they have been working ever since the singapore summit they have continually worked on their nuclear missile program they ve conducted dozens of short range missiles this year and each time it of course improves their capability they re assessing they ve done a summary base launch missile just recently last month so there s no indication that they have halted or they have stopped in fact they ve been working on their program so as we sit here the north korean threat has not gone away just because they don t test long range missiles they ve been working on their program michael morell would you say it s gotten worse the threat has gotten worse as they make these advances is that too strong sue mi terry i m not sure if it s necessarily worse but it certainly has not improved i would say it s worse because they re improving their missile program it at least feels like it s not worse because the missile test is not happening in front of our eyes these scary intercontinental ballistic missile tests but they ve been working on it so unless we can resolve the north korean crisis the threat has not gone away at all michael morell so i guess the one thing we have achieved here is a reduction in the tension that we saw very early in the trump administration right with kim doing the rapid tests and tr ump doing the fire and fury so that has gone away how important is that sue mi terry i do think it s important that we have some reduction of threat a sense right because those were anxiety filled days for korea watchers like myself in 2017 and the whole talk of preventive war bloody nose is just not very helpful not only in dealing with north korea but with our allies like south korea south korea was very unnerved by that kind of talk preventive war talk so i do think that s good that we re not talking about war in the korean peninsula so that is good but as we just talked about the fact of the matter is north korea s missile capability and nuclear capability is there their threat is there they re improving on that capability so it s not time for us to sit here and relax and think everything is fine just because north korea s not testing icbms michael morell what about the sanctions what s the status of the sanctions have they started to erode from where they were at the peak are they pretty much the same how do you think about that sue mi terry sanctions are definitely eroding not because we have lifted any of the sanctions but because what s so important about sanctions is that we get countries like china and russia to implement sanctions that s why i said earlier that in 2017 in the fall we got china to actually implement sanctions now in the aftermath of president trump meeting with kim xi jinping has also met with kim four times now their actual relationship is back on track china and north korea until the president met with kim or made a decision to meet with kim xi jinping had never met with kim jong un since kim jong un came into power xi jinping had met with the south korean leader former president park geun hye and moon jae in many times but not with kim jong un actually xi jinping didn t even like kim because kim killed jang song thaek the second most powerful man in north korea his uncle who was an interlocutor with the chinese assassinated kim jong nam his half brother who was under the protection of china all these missile and nuclear tests the chinese were very unhappy with that but now they re back in the picture xi met with kim xi jinping hosted kim jong un and his wife and even visited pyongyang so now china is loosening the implementation of sanctions so it s not a good stage because now that s giving breathing space to north korea and so if we want to use sanctions as leverage it s not good news for the united states and the international community when sanctions are not implemented on the ground and you re giving breathing space to the north koreans michael morell so sue what do you expect to happen between the united states and north korea between now and our election sue mi terry so i think there are two scenarios and both scenarios are bad for the united states one scenario is that there will be an interim deal that president trump decides that he needs a foreign policy success story he did after all say the north korean threat was no longer there after the singapore summit so there is a deal but what north koreans are asking for is massive sanctions relief so i don t believe we re going to have a deal unless we re ready to give some big sanctions relief and in return we ll get maybe just a freeze of nuclear testing and they ll pull up the yongbyon nuclear plant which they ve closed before so there might be an interim deal of some sort which i don t believe is necessarily moving towards denuclearization it s sort of a freeze michael morell in order to get that deal we d have to give them pretty much everything they wanted sue mi terry right which is massive sanctions relief which is what they asked for even in hanoi and that s why it fell apart or we don t do that there s no interim deal kim jong un says the timeline is until the end of the year the end of the year clock runs out there is no deal come january there s no deal and i m not sure if north koreans would necessarily sort of revert back to the icbm tests and nuke tests because they know that s sort of the red line for president trump but there re many things that they can do that are just short of that threshold such as medium range missile tests over japan or even a satellite launch a satellite launch is very interesting because it uses ballistic missile technology so it s really an icbm test but still north koreans can at least insist that this is different that it s a satellite launch maybe even president trump might say listen this is a satellite launch and other countries can do this so i think either we have a deal or we return to provocations michael morell and what s the point of the provocations if you re north korea what are you trying to achieve with the provocations sue mi terry you are continually dialing up pressure right so if you do a medium range test over japan if you do a satellite launch they re headed towards that nuke test and let s say now this is an election year let s say we re now talking march april of next year they re trying to dial up the pressure for either the us to come in and say okay fine we ll give you almost everything you want michael morell and get to that interim deal you talked about sue mi terry or they just run out the clock wait for the election see if president trump gets reelected and then maybe they will deal with it then or a new president in the us and then of course the long term goal for north korea and i still think this is a long term goal and this is what they re seeking is to gain international acceptance of north korea as a nuclear weapons power they want to be pakistan right for the international community to accept north korea as a responsible nuclear weapons power michael morell why is that a bad thing at the end of the day why should we worry about that why should it be our policy not to let that happen sue mi terry first of all just the message it s sending to all other countries world countries around there like iran and others that are watching that all you have to do is just keep at it and we ll just accept it secondly i think one of the biggest concerns is regional proliferation because once we accept north korea as a nuclear weapons power what is south korea going to do south korea is already now talking about it there are conservative circles out of south korea right now talking about potentially developing their own nuclear weapons or at least bringing tactical nuclear weapons back and then japan with prime minister abe has been trying to work on trying to normalize japan in terms of their self defense forces to having a normal military what will japan do would japan possibly go nuclear so we re worried about regional proliferation and of course we re also worried about global proliferation in additional to this wrong message we re sending to the rest of the world and the rogue nations michael morell sue can you envision a deal that would be acceptable to both sides sue mi terry i can envision a deal if we have a different mindset so if we say to ourselves let s talk to arms control because we re never going to get to denuclearization so let s get realistic and there are many arms control scholars and experts who say this is about threat reduction so if we can get to a deal where they freeze all their fissile material production they freeze all programs and that it can be verified that they re doing so they re abiding by that then i can some sort of a deal that s possible if you get into the mindset that that s okay but that s the debate is that okay or is that not okay because that s really accept north korea michael morell that s accepting it right sue mi terry as a nuclear weapons power and i failed to mention beyond regional proliferation another concern about really accepting north korea as a nuclear weapons power is that there is a concern that their behavior north korean behavior is not necessarily going to get better once they re fully accepted as a nuclear weapons power but that their behavior can get even more aggressive because now they think they have the deterrent against the united states and so meaning sort of border clashes that used to occur with south korea could still occur or the asymmetrical warfare like cyber that can all continue so it s not like north korea s threat is going to go away or provocations are going to go away just because we accept north korea as a nuclear weapons power in fact they could get more confident and continue on with provocations michael morell do you think north korea still envisions reunification of peninsula on their terms sue mi terry it s a very difficult question because on one hand i do think the north koreans cannot give up ultimately on the idea of reunification on its own terms because to live with a richer freer democratic rival state which is what north korea s doing right now south korea is a rival state they re just right there for everyone to see it s a free richer rival state and ultimately north korea s of course worried about german style unification right unification but absorption this is their ultimate fear so i don t think they can give it up now the question though is is kim jong un aware of how realistic that scenario is south korea is a thriving democracy you saw what they did as a public candlelight vigils ousted their last president it s a thriving democracy can this kind of democratic nation be okay to be just completely unified by north korea on its own terms but as a goal can north korea afford to give up that goal i don t think so so my answer would be i don t think north korea gave it up as a goal just as a practical matter i m not sure if it s so realistic michael morell yeah so let me ask several broader questions about north korea and these will be kind of random how do you think about kim jong un s domestic political position sue mi terry i think he has consolidated power and his domestic position is strong although i would think that the long term picture domestically i don t think is so stable it s just an inherently unstable system the reason is for example information that north korea controls its own public with a complete information blockade and ideological indoctrination but information is seeping into north korea more and more through the china north korea border and kim cannot completely stop that private markets are thriving black markets kim cannot stop that this is the only way people are able michael morell surviving sue mi terry to live survive so he cannot stop that and even the elites though even though they support him because kim purged almost anybody who can be a rival to him i would think that long term elites would be worried about their future because of so many purges and the very ruthless way in which kim has consolidated power so i would say yes he has consolidated power right now no we don t see any kind of potential challengers to kim because kim got rid of them but overall the long term stability picture is still not a great one michael morell so i remember as you know i worked on north korea a long long long long time ago i don t want to say how long ago laugh but even at that time we were saying this system can t survive forever but boy it s hung on right sue mi terry yes i often describe it as like a coma patient right you heard that phrase before it s like a coma patient it s sort of you can go any day or you can just go on another 50 years michael morell right right let me ask about the human rights situation in north korea which we don t hear much about doesn t get discussed certainly the united states has not made it the kind of issue that we used to make it has it gotten any better has it gotten worse is it roughly the same as it s been how do you think about that sue mi terry i don t think it has gotten any better this is sort of the thing that i regret about this as policy i do think when president trump first came into office in 2017 he did at least appear that he cared about north k orea s human rights issue the state of the union address he brought otto warmbier s family to the state of the union address he invited a north korean defector he hosted several meetings with north korean defectors when he went to south korea he gave this big speech in front of the national assembly he addressed north korean human rights but all of that sort of got thrown out just because he wanted to now not annoy kim no the human rights situation has not gotten better the united nations commission inquiry came out with a 400 page report several years ago that really details all the human rights violations that are going on in north korea which is an excellent report it says there s no parallel in contemporary history to the human rights violations that are going on in north korea except to nazi germany so that s how bad it is they call what s happening in north korea a crime against humanity and they list kim jong un by name as somebody who perpetuates crime against humanity and we see no indication that north korea has changed or closed any of the political prison camps that keep some 120 000 political prisoners that s a completely separate system there s a regular criminal penal system and then there are political prisons where they keep these dissidents or anybody who dares to criticize kim so i do think it s a very sad situation and of course we just don t focus enough on it we don t prioritize enough on human rights in north korea michael morell so sue let me finish up here by asking you two final questions the first is about the health of the us relationship with south korea seems to be fraying a bit is that your sense sue mi terry yes it s definitely fraying because the us and south korea right now are engaged in a border sharing negotiation and of course president trump came up with this figure of 5 billion that he s asking for south koreans to pay which is five times the money that they are paying president trump just has said over and over many times for many years this is something he actually believes in which is that the us is getting taken advantage of by our allies a country like south korea is rich they need to be paying more so it s a particularly bad time and of course with the korea japan relationship fraying the us does not like that what s happening with south korea and japan and so i think this is a particularly difficult period i would say the south korean public does support alliance when you see the polls they really do broadly support the alliance they support the us presence in south korea but i think right now at this particular moment they feel like they re being extorted with this ask of 5 billion for south korea defense michael morell and are there costs to us in the fraying of the relationship sue mi terry of course because i do think south korea s one of the closest allies in the region our troops are in south korea also not only to deter north korea right this is also to protect japan it s our forward presence it has also to do with dealing with china and south korea and the us have stood side by side for over 70 plus years keeping peace not only on the korean peninsula but in the entire northeast asian region south korea s a very important ally and we are there in south korea not only for south korea but we have interests in the region so i do think just really rhetorically and just by demanding that they pay so much more this is really hurting even the public perception of the alliance right now michael morell does the health of the relationship have any political impact in south korea on south korean politics sue mi terry so south korean politics are interesting right now there s a national assembly election that s coming up in april yes normally if the public saw it as the moon jae in administration s fault that the alliance is fraying it would actually cost the moon jae in administration politically but because right now they see us the united states asking for 5 billion as so unreasonable that s not what s going to be hurting the moon administration from the public s perspective michael morell got you got you so sue the second question i had was and you mentioned it already the state of the relationship between japan and south korea what s the story there sue mi terry it s the worst that it has ever been in terms of the korea japan relationship i think most people are surprised when they hear it they re not aware korea japan historically the relationship between the two countries they re two allies of the united states they re mature liberal democracies yet historically their relationship has always had ups and downs ever since japan colonized korea from 1910 to 1945 and even though there was a normalization agreement in 1965 it s just unsettled over historical grievances over issues like comfort women over the south koreans feeling like the japanese have not apologized enough and so on but the recent spate of tension recent tension basically what happened was when the administration came in he decided to go scrap the deal that took place between former south korean president park geun hye and japan on the comfort women deal and the moon administration sort of said no we re not going to abide by that agreement michael morell and just a reminder the comfort women issue is sue mi terry the sex slaves issue that the japanese basically forced women from many countries but including south korea to basically work as sex slaves during the war michael morell for japanese soldiers sue mi terry for the japanese soldiers there s a disagreement on that issue how that s perceived after going back on the comfort women deal there was a south korean supreme court decision that said they re forcing japanese companies to basically pay for wartime labor of south koreans that south koreans can individually sue the japanese that was the last straw for the japanese so they retaliated economically by taking south korea off the white list and then south korea retaliated by taking japan off the white list and right now there is what you call an intel sharing deal between japan and south korea called gsomia really that helps the us south korea and japan work together in terms of intelligence sharing it s very important because it helps us deal with china it helps us deal with north korea and that is about to expire on november 22nd and so that has caused all kinds of tension too it s been coming for the last several years but i would say today the korea japan relationship is at its worst michael morell and should we the united states be doing something to help bring these two allies back together that we re not doing or are we doing what we should be doing here sue mi terry i think we can do more in the previous administration the korea japan always had ups and downs but the more the us gets engaged there are periods when it s better right so under the obama administration tony blinken and others sort of forced the koreans and the japanese to sit down regularly and talk to each other so i do think the us must be engaged these are two of the closest allies friends of the united states it s critical that the trilateral relationship is a good one and it just hurts our interest to see these two allies at each other s throats like this it s very sad to see and i hope we can find a way out of this michael morell sue thank you so much for joining us it is always good to have you on the show sue mi terry thank you for having me end of transcript first published on november 20 2019 6 21 am 2019
