 editor s note this story was originally published on may 1 it has been updated to include the news that pataki has announced his presidential campaign manchester n h the tall man in a blazer burst into the chipotle in the middle of the afternoon he had a smile a tv camera following him and the jovial air of a man who expects to be recognized george pataki from new york he said shaking hands with the first two diners he met we re doing the non hillary tour we re actually saying hi to people then the tall man moved on to quiz the next table about their food chicken burrito i gotta try something new when he was gone the first two diners wondered who was that do they not have chipotle where he lives it s like oh i m from new york said aaron lee 22 what are you doing here then officially what george e pataki was doing was flirting for the fourth time in 16 years with the idea of running for president of the united states a few weeks ago pataki was in new hampshire raising money and telling people that he was close close close to making a decision i m strongly leaning toward making the run he told a radio station in new hampshire this happened three times before every other time pataki flirted with running he didn t on thursday the republican ex governor of new york announced that this time he is actually is running spring is the flirting season in american politics in the early part of this year more than 20 politicians were officially considering or exploring a run for president the key to understanding this strange every four years ritual is to understand that there are two kinds of flirting for the big name candidates the presidential flirt is a useful temporary legal dodge they will run they are essentially running already but they don t want to admit it yet because that would bring on tighter fundraising rules for the others particularly the eight or so who have fallen out of the political spotlight the flirt can be an end in itself it allows them to experience some of the most pleasant parts of a campaign audiences media attention a chance to raise money and then it lets them escape before they have to face the less pleasant parts such as getting crushed this time apparently pataki is ready to take that risk i make a joke that every four years there s the olympics there s the world cup and i come to new hampshire thinking about running for president pataki told a crowd of 15 people during a speech at a sea doo and snowmobile dealership in laconia n h nobody laughed then pataki said this election was different this time in all honesty i see things differently pataki 69 has already lived a remarkable political life the son of a postman he unseated liberal icon mario cuomo d in a 1994 governor s race one of new york s legendary upsets pataki then won second and third terms by large margins he led new york through the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the rebuilding of ground zero but he has not held office since 2007 since then his political star has faded somewhat who is bloomberg a jeopardy contestant said in january while looking at a photo of pataki the category was new york governors and the clue was he took new york into the 21st century no host alex trebek said the other two contestants stared blankly at the same photo without buzzing in until time ran out another sign there used to be a museum about pataki in his hometown of peekskill n y it opened after he left office complete with an exhibit where schoolkids could see pataki s gubernatorial desk then in 2013 it closed its leaders thought maybe more schoolkids would visit if it was a web site basically it would be like a monkey flying out of a unicorn s posterior if pataki won the 2016 republican nomination said florida based gop strategist rick wilson if pataki got into the gop primary he would face obstacles that go far beyond his meager name recognition he is pro choice he signed strict gun control laws he let state government spending grow rapidly in recent polls his best showing has been 1 percent let s just say a meteor strikes the first debate and kills everyone except pataki who is stuck in traffic let s hypothesize for a moment wilson said he thought no it still wouldn t be pataki they d find somebody else but despite those long odds pataki came to new hampshire last month for his eighth flirting related visit since september he later made a ninth i know i can appeal not just to republicans and conservatives but to independents and intelligent democrats as well pataki told an audience of eight college republicans at the university of new hampshire this is the heart of pataki s pitch to voters he s a republican who won big in a blue state he s a reformer who would tame washington s bureaucracy i go there today and it s like i m on an alien planet pataki said of washington they are an insular world they talk a language you don t understand in new hampshire pataki s crowds were not big at the official opening of his super pac s office in manchester for instance 25 people turned up and one of them turned out to be an incognito staffer for donald trump think about that if this was an intentional act of flirter against flirter espionage which the trump staffer denied it might be the most pointless dirty trick in the history of american politics nevertheless wherever pataki went the crowds were pleasant and admiring under a pataki administration one man asked him at a diner how would middle east policy change you d change everything pataki told him this is one of the things that makes flirting worthwhile for an ex politician it is an unlocked door back into the american political arena that can mean new audiences for men used to audiences the same college republicans for instance had recently hosted a 2016 flirter whose odds are even longer than pataki s former virginia governor james gilmore iii r gilmore left office in 2002 i mean thank god for wikipedia said unh senior elliot gault 22 and the same kind of magic works on the news media before former rhode island governor lincoln chafee d announced he was exploring a presidential run on april 9 the washington post had not quoted him about anything in nine months in the weeks after that the post quoted him eight times er nine clinton is just too hawkish chafee said in an interview repeating his signature attack line on the democratic front runner former secretary of state hillary rodham clinton the other great thing about flirting is the money while you flirt you can raise it and if you don t run you can spend it anyway in 1999 for instance pataki flirted with a campaign then gave up and endorsed george w bush in 2007 he did it again i was very serious about it that time pataki says now but mayor giuliani the former new york city mayor was in the race and pataki didn t think there was room for two new yorkers so he got out both times pataki raised more than 1 million in donors money both times the new york times reported pataki spent it giving to allied republican candidates paying for pataki s travels and paying a circle of pataki s own advisers strategists and fundraisers then came 2012 i was very serious about it pataki says but everywhere i went people had committed to mitt romney he pulled the plug but still raised and spent more than 600 000 via a political nonprofit this year pataki is raising money again for a super pac called we the people not washington among those leading the fundraising are several pataki associates who got paid from the money he raised in past flirtations aides wouldn t say how much he d raised or spent this time because he was my friend i wouldn t feel cheated if pataki didn t run i m never one to say that a guy should be a suicide lunatic said peter kalikow a new york real estate titan who donated to pataki s super pac this year in the last presidential cycle kalikow was a major backer of another long shot pizza executive herman cain pataki s aides said they had a strategy ready if their man really got into the race he ll stand out in the debates with his genial wit and executive experience then he ll surge in new hampshire by appealing to libertarian leaning wait perhaps we re getting ahead of ourselves when i heard the name i was like pataki pataki pataki but i didn t know that he was the mayor of new york tony coutee 42 a crane operator who was at the second table pataki visited in that manchester chipotle said incorrectly after pataki left his table coutee said i googled him and found out so he is running asked coutee s lunch companion jason soto 35 yes coutee said while the two of them were talking pataki was into a full blown campaign style restaurant schmooze he bumped elbows with the grill man he walked back to greet employees in the walk in cooler he just shook my hand and i said i didn t want to be on camera and he asked if i was on parole one said bewildered pataki went through the line and loudly asked if he could leave a tip then he came back and sat down with coutee and soto i m trying the chicken burrito pataki told them the two men quickly got up to leave kinda normal soto said of this only in flirting season interaction a pseudo conversation with a pseudo candidate who never said what he was running for but abnormal anu narayanswamy in washington contributed to
