the food and drug administration is digging into data that says a popularcoronavirus test may give inaccurate results commissioner stephen hahn said however hahn said the agency recommends that the abbott laboratory test which is used to test president donald trump and white house staffers still be available for use the fda issued an emergency authorization in march for the abbott id now point of care test which delivers results in minutes the fda published a warning about it on thursday after an nyu langone health study which has not been peer reviewed found that it might return false negatives meaning it might say a person doesn t have the virus when they actually do what we re saying is that there are some data to suggest that there may be inaccuracies false negatives with the abbott test however there are many users who have contacted us and have not had this problem so fda is digging into it and we re working with abbott to actually look at what data are available to get the most up to date and accurate information about the test performance hahn said on cbs this morning friday that being said the test is on the market we continue to recommend its use or to have it available for use hahn also noted that point of care tests in general would have a lower sensitivity than a test that s based in the laboratory we ve known that for years he said but added that the data the fda used to grant the emergency use authorization for the abbott test were very robust the purpose of the new fda warning was to make sure providers have the information about what the test does so for example if a person you suspect a doctor suspects a person has the disease it might be worth if the test is negative getting a second confirmatory test that s what our guidance is about he said hahn said the fda is providing guidance to the white house about the test but said it is up to them if they choose to keep using it mr trump has praised the test as ultra fast and very accurate abbott said while some studies have shown the sensitivity performance percentages or true positive rates of the test to be in the 80s others have shown it at or above 90 and one showed it as high as 94 we re seeing studies being conducted to understand the role of id now in ways that it was not designed to be used in particular the nyu study results are not consistent with other studies the statement said while we understand no test is perfect test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection specimen type collection handling storage transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run id now is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method the company also said it will clarify its guidelines and continue to optimize the test hahn also was asked about the testing capacity in the united states we continue to work with close to 300 test developers we have not taken our foot off the pedal with respect to this he said we recognize the need to get more tests on the market and we re working with developers to do that he said there are a number of factors contributing to delays in more tests including the need for data before authorizing a test and an unprecedented demand for the tests hahn would not say if putting the onus on states to run testing and contact tracing was the best approach but said there are unique circumstances in the states the governors understand what best happens in the states and we will provide them as much support as we possibly can to make the absolute best public health decisions he said watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
