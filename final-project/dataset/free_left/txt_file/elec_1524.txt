advertisement supported by news analysis by amy chozick for more than a year hillary clinton has traveled the country talking to voters about her policy plans she vowed to improve infrastructure in her first 100 days in office promised to increase funding for alzheimer s research and proposed a 10 billion plan to combat drug and alcohol addiction but as the democratic primary contest comes to a close any hopes mrs clinton had of running a high minded policy focused campaign have collided with a more visceral problem voters just don t trust her the clinton campaign had hoped to use the coming weeks to do everything they could to shed that image and convince voters that mrs clinton can be trusted instead they must contend with a damaging new report by the state department s inspector general that mrs clinton had not sought or received approval to use a private email server while she was secretary of state it is not just that the inspector general found fault with her email practices the report speaks directly to a wounding perception that mrs clinton is not forthright or transparent the state department s inspector general issued a report concluding that hillary clinton did not follow the requirements for handling records and should not have used a private server for department emails while she was secretary of state after months of mrs clinton s saying she used a private email for convenience and that she was willing to cooperate fully with investigations into her handling of official business at the state department the report delivered to congress on wednesday undermined both claims mrs clinton through her lawyers declined to be interviewed by the inspector general as part of the review and when staff members raised concerns about the wisdom of her using a nongovernment email address they were hushed by state department officials who instructed them never to speak of the secretary s personal email system again in november 2010 when a state department aide requested she release her personal email address or start using an official address mrs clinton said she was open to using a second device or email address but added i don t want any risk of the personal being accessible mrs clinton s allies on wednesday jumped on the fact that the report also revealed that colin powell the secretary of state under president george w bush and other state department officials had also exclusively used personal email accounts the inspector general documents just how consistent her email practices were with those of other secretaries and senior officials at the state department said brian fallon a clinton spokesman but mr powell is not running for president against a likely opponent donald j trump who has now adopted the drumbeat of crooked hillary the f b i recently uncovered new emails potentially related to the investigation into hillary clinton s private email server crooked hillary crooked hillary she s as crooked as they come mr trump said at a rally in anaheim calif his attacks came as mrs clinton tried to break through with her own criticism that mr trump had profited from the 2008 housing crisis but the clinton campaign s new effort to define mr trump as a con man who rips off the little guy for his own gain will be met with the trickle of new developments related to mrs clinton s private email the f b i is separately investigating whether mrs clinton and her aides exposed sensitive national security information in their email correspondence she has already turned over 55 000 pages of emails to the state department and mrs clinton s campaign has struggled to put the issue behind her mrs clinton spent much of last summer insisting she did not need to apologize for keeping a private server in her home in chappaqua n y because the practice was allowed then in september she offered a tortured apology acknowledging in an interview with abc news that using a private email server had been a mistake she added i m sorry about that mrs clinton has long contended that voters care more about issues like equal pay for women widely available child care and making college more affordable than how she handled her emails as secretary of state even her democratic primary opponent senator bernie sanders of vermont tried to squelch the storm over the private server during the first democratic debate last fall but something has seeped into the electorate a presidential campaign always contends with incoming fire but it is also designed to serve as an infomercial to present a candidate s best attributes instead mrs clinton has gone from having a 69 percent approval rating and being one of the most popular public figures in the country when she left the state department in 2013 to having one of the highest disapproval ratings of any likely presidential nominee of a major party roughly 53 percent of voters said they had an unfavorable opinion of mrs clinton in a new abc news washington post poll some 60 percent of voters said they had an unfavorable opinion of mr trump when asked if mrs clinton and mr trump are honest and trustworthy 64 percent of registered voters replied no according to a recent new york times cbs news poll ask voters why they don t trust mrs clinton and again and again they will answer with a single word emails i don t believe a word when she says she didn t know what she was doing with those emails said debbie figel 57 she plans to vote for mr trump this email business really concerns me said john dunn 58 of oneida n y advertisement
