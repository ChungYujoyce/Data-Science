look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without

an american enterprise institute report scott gottlieb caitlin rivers mark b mcclellan lauren silvis and crystal watson staked out four goal posts for recovery hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms the state is able to conduct

list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested it seems to spread very easily from person to person especially in homes hospitals and other confined spaces the pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out it may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face no clinical trials are underway in the united states china and europe but american officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away

elderly and those with underlying conditions not just those with respiratory diseases particularly hard if the family member doesn t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms while also keeping as much distance as possible according to guidelines issued by the c d c if there s space the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if masks are available both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters doorknobs toilets and tables don t forget to wash your hands frequently plan two weeks of meals if possible but people should not hoard food or supplies despite the empty shelves the supply chain remains strong and remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and
