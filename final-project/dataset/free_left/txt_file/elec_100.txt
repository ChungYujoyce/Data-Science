by justin peters it took only two minutes to know that the second night of the democratic debates on cnn would be very annoying tonight a gravelly voiced narrator intoned over a video promo that introduced each candidate as though they were characters in some guilty pleasure reality tv show a critical rematch former vice president joe biden aiming to reclaim his momentum sen kamala harris not backing down after clashing with biden over race the presentation would have been a good fit for wrestlemania presidential politics this time it s personal the implication was clear cnn expected the candidates to rumble on wednesday night the network got what it wanted the debate was a contentious one though not as feisty as tuesday s debate largely thanks to the absence of the perpetually snippy john delaney with biden going after harris and basically everyone else onstage going after biden although the moderators were less aggressive about cutting candidates off as they had mercilessly the night before dana bash don lemon and jake tapper largely took a hands off approach setting up each thematic segment of the debate with a specific question directed toward a single candidate and then bringing in other candidates by asking them to respond to what their counterparts just said do you have a response was how the follow up usually went what they really meant was fight though this strategy ultimately proved exasperating it was a mild improvement on tuesday night s debate in which the moderators spent much of their time aggressively questioning the positions of sens elizabeth warren and bernie sanders the two most prominent progressives in the field while i understand the impulse to use the debates as an opportunity to hold candidates feet to the fire on their policies and public statements the questions seemed mostly designed to get warren and sanders to admit that they are not in fact centrists mission accomplished anyway someone at cnn apparently decided the moderators should step back and let the candidates tear each other up instead and so on wednesday bash lemon and tapper mostly let the candidates engage with each other intervening only to call time or bring other voices into the fray this minimalist approach worked well during the health care section of the debate in part because it exposed how uncomfortable both biden and harris are when being challenged on this topic that s valuable information for democratic voters as they try to envision the general election by the end of the second hour however cnn had reached the limits of the your response strategy it turns out that candidate x another candidate says this thing what do you think is not a productive mode of questioning at times it felt like the moderators had primarily researched what the candidates had said about each other s policies not what those policies actually said the laziness showed sometimes when one candidate actually had criticized another s policies it was clear why the former should be asked to respond as in the health care portion but more often the moderators would just randomly invite candidate y to respond to candidate x s statements without setting up why they thought candidate y s perspective would be valuable we will have to stop separating children from their parents make it so that it s easier for people to seek asylum in this country make sure that we are securing our borders and making it so that people are able to use our legal immigration system by reforming those laws rep tulsi gabbard said during the immigration portion mr yang your response was lemon s follow up what exactly was andrew yang supposed to be responding to gabbard hadn t mentioned him at all a little bit later biden offered an odd garbled comment about how anybody that crosses the stage with a ph d you should get a green card for seven years we should keep them here nobody understood quite what he meant instead of asking biden to clarify though lemon said thank you thank you very much mr vice president gov inslee what s your response what we didn t need to hear from jay inslee about joe biden s confusing statement we needed to hear from joe biden about his confusing statement the candidates were sometimes confused by the moderators tactics too at one point biden said something about how immigrants made america great and how president barack obama tried hard to change the immigration system in the face of significant pushback sen gillibrand what s your response lemon asked sen kirsten gillibrand didn t have a response because she wasn t expecting to be called on because biden s answer had absolutely nothing to do with her ummm she said fumbling for a few seconds before eventually eking out an answer about treating others the way you d want to be treated the sequence may come to be seen as a gaffe on her part but it s more accurate to see it as a function of the moderators strategy if we can call it that since their follow ups barely required them to think about the substance of anything said i will concede that it probably wasn t just laziness that dictated cnn s approach wednesday night there were 10 people onstage and less than three hours scheduled for the debate after all cnn had to find some way to get all of the candidates involved and daisy chaining one candidate s response after another was certainly one way to solve that problem it just wasn t a particularly helpful solution for voters it wasn t even entertaining which was probably what cnn most had in mind no one said that moderating these crowded debates is easy but it shouldn t be this hard either ask actual questions listen to their answers ask follow up questions based on what the candidates said or didn t say when you bring a new candidate into an existing discussion offer a brief prelude that explains why you think their perspective would be relevant give the candidates room to debate but don t abdicate your responsibility to keep the discussion on point sounds simple but we didn t see much of any of this on either tuesday or wednesday nights on tuesday cnn fixated on knocking down those pesky progressives by directing politically hostile questions to the night s front runners while showing bizarre deference to the least relevant candidate on stage on wednesday cnn stepped back and let the candidates squabble and left viewers with barely any takeaway at all readers like you make our work possible help us continue to provide the reporting commentary and criticism you won t find anywhere
