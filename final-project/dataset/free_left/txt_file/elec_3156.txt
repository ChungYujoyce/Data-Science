by ruth graham democratic presidential candidate marianne williamson urged her twitter followers to pray for the bahamas and the southern u s coast on wednesday morning as hurricane dorian made its devastating path northward this in itself was not a remarkable thing for a presidential candidate to do the unusual thing was that williamson also seemed to suggest that the power of the mind could alter the hurricane s path millions of us seeing dorian turn away from land is not a wacky idea williamson tweeted it is a creative use of the power of the mind two minutes of prayer visualization meditation for those in the way of the storm the sentiment didn t last long by 10 15 a m it had been deleted and replaced with a more anodyne message of support prayers for the people of the bahamas florida georgia and the carolinas may the peace of god be upon them and their hearts be comforted as they endure the storm as is often the case with williamson s rhetoric her original meaning was slippery was she really saying that if enough people prayed the hurricane would physically turn away from populated areas or was the idea just to send good vibes to people in dorian s path the tweet and its swift deletion are by now a standard part of williamson s playbook gesture to a genuinely unusual spiritual belief and then clarify it in a way that scans as a complete reversal to casual observers at a campaign event in new hampshire in june for example williamson called vaccine mandates draconian and orwellian and compared vaccination to the abortion debate the u s government doesn t tell any citizen in my book what they have to do with their body or their child the next day she appeared to reverse course tweeting i understand that many vaccines are important and save lives a vaccine skeptic listening closely however would be able to find plenty of succor between the lines williamson has questioned the value of vaccines multiple times over the years and her supposed clarifications leave ample room for interpretation in an interview last week with david remnick on the new yorker radio hour she said she s not an anti vaxxer and called the orwellian comment sloppy but vaccine skeptics rarely if ever call themselves anti vaxxers and she said almost in the same breath that some of them have legitimate questions when remnick pressed her pointing out that well meaning people can be scientifically wrong she sounded like she agreed with him the government has to make the decision that based on its scientific evaluation is in the best interest of the public and that s what i would do as president she said anyone listening casually would have thought she conceded the point but she didn t actually say what she hoped or expected the government s scientific consensus might be which brings us back to wednesday s quickly deleted creative use of the power of the mind tweet about hurricane dorian to be fair if there s ever an appropriate time for a political figure to call publicly for prayer the hours when a natural disaster is bearing down surely qualifies in these moments while emergency officials prepare there s little else to be done president donald trump s nuke plans notwithstanding as slate s shannon palus has written williamson s actual policy proposals are generally pretty science literate she believes in man made climate change and that the problem requires immediate political attention unlike anti gun control politicians in the wake of mass shootings she s not substituting prayer for policy calling for prayer at a time like this is a gesture of attention and concern but mainstream national politicians even republicans appealing to conservative christians rarely suggest that prayer can affect the physical world in real time they also don t use phrases like power of the mind or visualization or suggest an exact length for effective prayers obviously someone at williamson hq realized this quickly but its existence however brief suggests someone there believes it just a little bit too update 4 36 p m as this post was being published williamson tweeted in apparent defense of her original sentiment or at least the concept of prayer prayer is a power of the mind and it is neither bizarre nor unintelligent people of faith belong in the democratic party and will be necessary to the effort if we re to win in 2020 i was born and raised in texas so i ve seen it millions of people today are praying that dorian turn away from land and treating those people with mockery or condescension because they believe it could help is part of how the overly secularized left has lost lots of voters it s unclear why williamson would delete the original tweet if she believes this thanks for signing up you can manage your newsletter
