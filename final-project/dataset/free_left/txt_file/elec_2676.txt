advertisement supported by by amy chozick facing a tougher than expected challenge from senator bernie sanders of vermont hillary clinton s campaign is preparing for a primary fight that could stretch into late april or early may and require a sprawling field operation in states and territories from pennsylvania to guam with the iowa caucuses in two weeks and mr sanders s insurgent candidacy chipping away at mrs clinton s once formidable lead there clinton aides are acknowledging that the road to the party s july convention could be an expensive slog remember i campaigned all the way into june last time mrs clinton told cnn last week even though the clinton team has sought to convey that it has built a national operation the campaign has invested much of its resources in the feb 1 caucuses in iowa hoping that a victory there could marginalize mr sanders and set mrs clinton on the path to the nomination as much as 90 percent of the campaign s resources are now split between iowa and the brooklyn headquarters according to an estimate provided by a person with direct knowledge of the spending the campaign denied that figure the campaign boasted last june when mrs clinton held her kickoff event on roosevelt island in new york that it had at least one paid staff member in all 50 states but the effort did not last and the staff members were soon let go or reassigned mrs clinton s campaign manager robby mook said they had been hired as temporary workers to sign up volunteers at the start of the campaign an effort he said had paid off organizationally the focus on iowa which still haunts mrs clinton after the stinging upset by barack obama there in 2008 has been so intense that even organizers in new hampshire which holds its primary on feb 9 have complained to the campaign s leadership that they feel neglected on a call with supporters last week mrs clinton s aides laid out a scenario in which the race against mr sanders stretched through april a prospect that they said would require about 50 million for a national ground operation and other expenses it s not just a question of the first two states or the first four states mr mook said in an interview at sunday s democratic debate in charleston s c we re going to keep going into the map as long as it takes for all its institutional advantages the clinton campaign lags behind the sanders operation in deploying paid staff members for example mr sanders has campaign workers installed in all 11 of the states that vote on super tuesday mrs clinton does not and is relying on union volunteers and members of supportive organizations such as planned parenthood to help her it would be good to have the momentum story the day after the caucus of oh bernie won mr sanders s campaign manager jeff weaver said but it s really about grinding out the delegates grind grind grind grind grind asked about the discrepancy between the campaigns and whether mrs clinton s team planned to put staff in all of the super tuesday states marlon marshall her director of state campaigns and political engagement declined to comment specifically and instead repeated this line three times we ve had folks in states for a while according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president the scramble after the contests in iowa and new hampshire will be intense if mrs clinton fails to win either state and her campaign seems to be stumbling her donations could dry up but a loss could also motivate donors who had viewed her nomination as a foregone conclusion even if mrs clinton wins in iowa where she maintains a slight lead in most polls mr sanders could receive an outpouring of small donations if the outcome is close that would help him compete in subsequent states mr sanders a small state senator who has never run for national office has shown surprising fund raising muscle many of his donors have yet to give him the maximum individual contribution of 2 700 meaning they could be tapped repeatedly if the contest remains close his campaign raised 33 million in the final quarter of 2015 just 4 million less than mrs clinton mrs clinton s aides say they expect to win iowa and new hampshire and are ready for the grind a giant whiteboard on the wall of the campaign s headquarters maps out where staff members would be sent depending on the outcomes in the early states we just game out a bunch of different scenarios mr mook said it s kind of like choose your own adventure this is not the adventure the clinton team would have chosen a prolonged primary campaign against an opponent widely popular with the party s liberal base could exhaust donors who will also be asked to contribute to an expensive campaign to defeat the republican nominee a contentious race against mr sanders could also weaken mrs clinton s standing among democratic voters she would need in november during the call with supporters last week mrs clinton s aides did not talk much about iowa instead emphasizing the possibility that the battle with mr sanders could quickly become national mrs clinton has many strengths to exploit in a democratic primary candidates are awarded delegates based on their vote totals so mrs clinton and mr sanders can get close to the roughly 2 200 needed to secure the nomination by racking up a combination of victories and solid second place showings delegates people active in politics chosen by party leaders to represent their states at the convention typically take the lead from whichever candidate won their state s contest the democratic party also has superdelegates or party leaders and elected officials who are free to support any candidate mrs clinton holds a large lead among these party leaders with several hundred superdelegates signed on to support her campaign compared with 16 or so for mr sanders mrs clinton has deep support among blacks and latinos mr sanders by contrast has struggled to connect with minorities and trails mrs clinton by double digits in nevada and south carolina which vote later next month mrs clinton s campaign is counting on minority voters to help her win in the south it has assembled leadership councils of elected officials party leaders and activists who have endorsed mrs clinton and has held campaign events in states beyond the early four including the delegate rich texas tennessee georgia florida and virginia many people feel she has a comfortable firewall built past the first two contests said anita dunn a democratic strategist unaffiliated with either candidate but she added if there is one thing we ve seen in 2016 it s that politics is not playing by the rules it previously did at a fish fry hosted by representative james e clyburn of south carolina held at an outdoor pavilion in charleston on the eve of the debate on sunday mrs clinton received a raucous welcome and chants of hillary hillary mr sanders received a less enthusiastic response once the campaign moves past those first two states i think the dynamics and the playing field become much more favorable to secretary clinton said geoff garin a pollster who was a chief strategist on mrs clinton s 2008 campaign mr sanders s campaign has also been crunching the delegate math it says he can outperform mrs clinton with white voters and voters under 45 who favor mr sanders two to one and pick up delegates in states that have caucuses rather than primaries his campaign is optimistic in states like colorado minnesota and wyoming which hold caucuses a system that favors the party s most liberal voters as well as in other states with relatively small and mostly white populations of democrats to be a democrat in oklahoma you ve got to be real liberal said michael briggs a spokesman for mr sanders advertisement
