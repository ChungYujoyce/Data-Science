uncertainty over how the coronavirus could impact political fundraising winred the platform used by a growing number of republican candidates to raise funds announced it brought in nearly 60 million in april alone that s nearly half of the 130 million winred raised during the first three months of the year combined the april cash haul came from more than 1 6 million donations the average donation was 37 about 2 less than the average donation seen during the first quarter of the year last month winred also saw its biggest day of fundraising ever in its 10 month history on april 30 while the last day of the month tends to see a spike in donations as candidates make final pitches to boost their numbers winred raised 7 1 million that day april was also the first month where campaigning and fundraising had to be conducted 100 online according to winred s gerrit lansing when the coronavirus first started to force campaigns to cancel in person events and move online in march fundraising numbers were not perhaps as big as they could have been that month but he is actually surprised there was not a bigger dip we seem to be seeing a lot of resiliency and energy he said among its april donors winred also had more than 61 000 end up using the platform to sign up to volunteer as well this comes as campaigns and grassroots organizations across the country have to rethink their organizing strategy moving into the summer and fall due to the pandemic right now more than 800 campaigns are using winred to raise funds as the platform continues to grow to compete with democrats actblue actblue has not yet released specifics on its april fundraising but an official tellscbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall wiceit did see strong fundraising numbers across the

on track to hit that number by the end of the election cycle come november michigan the michigan court of claims heard oral arguments on the michigan legislature s lawsuit challenging democratic governor gretchen whitmer s executive orders extending the state of emergency in response to the coronavirus pandemic cbs news campaign reporter jack turmansays the legislature did not extend the state of emergency at the end of april but whitmer declared a state of emergency citing two laws the emergency powers of governor act from 1945 and the emergency management act of 1976 that grant her the authority to extend the state of emergency without the legislature s approval michael williams who represented the michigan legislature argued that whitmer does not have emergency powers under the 1976 law which states that legislative approval is required to extend a state of emergency because the legislature did not extend the state of emergency williams said legislative approval is important because it allows for the legislature to provide a check on executive power if a governor is really going to assert that degree of broad power that degree of just generalized all encompassing power there needs to be some mechanism by which the people s legislators can say no we re ready to take the reins we are ready to be the ones to actually reassume the lawmaking power williams explained chris allen an assistant solicitor general in michigan argued that whitmer has a duty to act during an emergency if an emergency still exists there is no dispute that a disaster and emergency exist yet the legislature withheld allen said and they can do that under the statute i m not saying that they were statutorily obligated to do so but they didn t that does not remove the governor s duty to declare if the conditions warrant it in regards to the 1945 emergency powers law which grants the governor with the authority to issue reasonable orders without legislative approval williams argued that the 1945 law pertains to local emergencies instead of statewide emergencies allen said the broad language in the 1945 emergency powers law allows the governor to act during a public emergency to bring the emergency under control nevada true the vote hasrenewed its push in federal court to roll back nevada s upcoming all mail primary after a judge last monthrejected their initial motion new plaintiffs in the suit now include nevada right to life whose members intend to vote in the coming primary but fear disenfranchisement molly forgey a spokesperson for state democrats fired backin a statement the gop s amended complaint adds nothing to its already failed nevada case and only highlights that voter suppression is its sole electoral strategy during this grave public health crisis in fact while democratslast month moved to intervene in the legal battle the gop has not sought to join true the vote s lawsuit however republicans in the statehave decried changes to the june contest in the state s most populous county which true the vote cites as one of the key factors for their latest effort in court we ve got now a classic bush v gore situation where we have one set of standards for voting in one county versus in all the other counties in the state james bopp true the vote s attorney tellscbs news campaign reporter alex tin people have a general opinion that most of the corruption in nevada is in clark county and now they ve agreed with the democrats to disregard state laws and increase their vote and make them an even heavier player in the state so there s no question that has exacerbated the situation added bopp attack mode in competitive house and senate races across the country some republican groups have been seizing on former senate staffer tara reade s sexual assault allegations against joe biden to denounce their democratic rivals through press releases and social media posts conservative groups have launched a flurry of attacks targeting candidates in competitive races both for not weighing in on the topic or for standing by their party s presumptive nominee and calling on reporters to ask democrats where they stand on the accusations

district none made any mention of reade or biden mr trump s campaign has released videos and statements blasting democrats over tara reade but has yet to commit any funds to boost their ads on the
