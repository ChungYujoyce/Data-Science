applications increasing it is not clear yet that there is a significant function creep he said but the risk that this may happen is high in india which has neither a data protection law nor a data protection authority said suhrith parthasarathy a lawyer aarogya setu is framed as a necessary technological invasion into personal privacy to achieve a larger social purpose he told the thomson
