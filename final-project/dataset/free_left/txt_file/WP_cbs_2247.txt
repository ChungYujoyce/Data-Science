dr scott gottlieb the former commissioner of the food and drug administration under president trump warned sunday that georgia is jumping the gun with allowing some businesses to reopen as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic it s going to take some time until we see sustained declines in new cases and get to the point where there s a low enough level of spread in the country that we could feel comfortable about opening up parts of the country gottlieb said on face the nation it s going to be probably mid may maybe late may in parts of this nation georgia s certainty jumping the gun i think here getting started too early relative to where they are in the epidemic georgia is one of the first states to begin easing restrictions on businesses though tennessee and south carolina were close to follow governor brian kemp allowed gyms hair and nail salons bowling alleys tattoo parlors and massage therapists to begin operating friday in compliance with health and safety requirements on monday theaters and restaurant dine in services can open their doors again kemp s decision put him at odds with president trump who said last week he disagreed with the decision mr trump said he believes businesses can wait a little bit longer as the state has not yet met the administration s criteria to proceed to a phased opening gottlieb warned georgia s reopening does up the risk of infection and said the state is testing roughly 1 of its total population public health officials say that broad testing is crucial to begin easing social distancing measures georgia s certainly not out of the woods gottlieb said adding there are 23 000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the state they may have plateaued in their epidemic maybe but they re still accruing a lot of new cases and they certainly aren t coming down in terms of the number of new cases each day gottlieb said last month it s unlikely life in the u s will return to normal until there is a coronavirus vaccine but the country s ability to quickly develop a vaccine may have been impeded with the ouster of dr rick bright director of the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda last week bright said he was involuntarily transferred to the national institutes of health after he limited the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine a drug touted by mr trump gottlieb said bright who he knows and has testified alongside was very effective in his role at barda when asked whether the change up in personnel would impact the timeline for developing a vaccine gottlieb said it s hard to say it doesn t i think it was important to have continuity in that job and he was effective he was a vaccine expert so i was sorry to see him go he said i think changing leadership in that position right now certainly is going to set us back it s hard to argue that that s not going to have some impact on the continuity and also make businesses companies that need to collaborate with barda a little bit more reluctant now to embrace barda now that there s a cloud hanging over it and some uncertainty about the leadership gottlieb also pushed back on the use of disinfectants to treat covid 19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus mr trump last week speculated about injecting disinfectants though he walked back the remark telling reporters friday he was being sarcastic there s no effective use of a disinfectant internally he said and we should be very clear about that nobody should be using a disinfectant as an ingested agent injecting it eating it in any fashion these are deadly agents we see thousands of calls to poison control each year around people who consume disinfect and so we need to be very clear about this that nobody should be consuming a disinfectant and they don t work for the treatment of anything let alone coronavirus watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
