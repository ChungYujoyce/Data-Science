advertisement supported by by amy chozick and yamiche alcindor barbara schierenbeck a 59 year old nurse in brooklyn is swept up in the excitement of potentially electing hillary clinton the first female president she cannot understand why her 19 year old daughter anna does not feel the same way fifteen or 20 years ago no one would even think about a woman being president mrs schierenbeck said certainly when i was 20 years old in the 1970s i don t think i would even have thought about it but for her daughter electing a woman while a nice idea is not a motivating factor i want to see someone who like has the fervor to fight for me anna schierenbeck said a woman will be elected president pretty soon anyway she said regardless of what happens in 2016 why does that woman have to be mrs clinton the mother daughter debate unfolding in the schierenbeck household reflects a debate taking place across the country as women of varying ages and backgrounds confront the potential milestone implicit in mrs clinton s bid very differently as her chances of becoming the first woman to be nominated by a major political party improve many women are considering how much gender should play into their decisions to embrace mrs clinton s candidacy or not the generational divide in how they answer that question has added urgency to mrs clinton s efforts to focus on how she appeals to younger women who overwhelmingly vote democratic but who might sit out an election if they are not excited by a candidate after beginning her candidacy in april with hopes of inspiring women that this was their moment she is now more intent on trying to forge common cause on specific issues and less on merely shattering the glass ceiling unlike in her 2008 campaign mrs clinton has this year leaned heavily on her gender often ending speeches by invoking an america where a father can tell his daughter yes you can be anything you want to be even president of the united states it is a powerful line for mrs clinton s most avid supporters college educated women in their 50s and 60s for baby boomer women in particular it s i fought this whole war and now we re running out of time and if not hillary then who would it be said celinda lake a democratic pollster who is herself a baby boomer but younger women are less impressed meghan speed a 20 year old college junior from concord n c said she expected a woman to be elected president in the next 20 years but planned to vote for senator bernie sanders in the democratic primary because of his record on issues like income inequality for me it was very difficult to wrap my mind around not fully supporting hillary because she is a woman she said but i came to the realization that if i am supporting her because she is a woman that s equally as bad as not supporting her because of her gender indeed clinton campaign officials who say younger voters are generally harder to engage than older voters have tried to reach women ages 18 to 35 with snapchat videos and personalized bitmoji emoticons but also with serious attention to issues that motivate them putting a woman in the oval office is presented as an added bonus millennial women are getting more and more involved in this campaign because they re hearing about hillary clinton s proven track record fighting for women and the issues she s talking about that matter to them like equal pay college affordability and protecting women s health care rights said mini timmaraju the campaign s director of women s outreach the democratic primary provides mrs clinton with an opportunity to lay the groundwork among a constituency she would rely on heavily in a general election fifty two percent of women lean democratic compared with 44 percent of men but young women and black and latino women in particular will not participate in an election unless they are inspired by a candidate according to polling by the pew research center in 2012 55 percent of women who voted went for president obama compared with 44 percent for mitt romney giving the president a particular boost in critical swing states like ohio exit polls showed that mrs clinton s candidacy has not yet sparked among young women the kind of excitement about making history that mr obama generated among black voters in 2008 speaks to the progress that women have made said erin gloria ryan 32 formerly the managing editor of the feminist website jezebel the younger generation of which ms ryan counts herself a member just thinks the pipeline will magically fill up with women who are qualified enough to run for president she said the generational gap haunted mrs clinton in the 2008 primary in iowa mr obama took 51 percent john edwards 19 percent and mrs clinton just 11 percent of the caucus vote among women younger than 24 the only demographic cohort that mrs clinton won exit polls showed was women older than 65 but mrs clinton largely ceded the youth vote to mr obama in that campaign she did not play up her chance to make history this time mrs clinton 68 anticipating that the election will hinge on her support among women frequently talks about being a mother and grandmother she uses gender as a way to overcome the perception that she is the establishment candidate and to counter questions about her age i cannot imagine anyone being more of an outsider than the first woman president she told cbs news i mean really let s think about that and she often says i ll be the youngest woman president in the history of the united states that message galvanizes an army of devoted supporters including women like pat higby a 62 year old educator in cedar falls iowa who sounded a familiar refrain when asked why she planned to vote for mrs clinton it s time she said for women near her in age mrs clinton represents the apex of that generation s aspirations for itself said ms ryan the writer and editor ambivalence about her among their daughters and granddaughters can be maddening they haven t experienced the kind of barriers that their mothers and grandmothers did the kind of exclusions from areas of accomplishment mary l shanley a political science professor at vassar who specializes in gender studies said of women born after 1980 mrs clinton s standing among white women has declined in some recent polls but women remain the backbone of her support more than half of all women said they had a favorable opinion of mrs clinton compared with 36 percent of men according to a quinnipiac university poll released this month history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling but just 38 percent of women aged 18 to 29 said they supported mrs clinton in the democratic primary compared with 40 percent for mr sanders according to a poll of 2 011 young people released thursday by harvard s institute of politics mrs clinton s efforts to reach young women have been mostly focused around specific issues her most expensive proposal so far is a 350 billion plan to make college more affordable and she released a youtube video about curtailing sexual assault on college campuses she has also tried to reach young women in new ways one of her first national interviews was with refinery29 a style newsletter she gave a long interview to the actress and writer lena dunham talking about her plans to relieve student debt and to improve relations between the police and african americans her campaign has released an emoji animated snapchat video supporting planned parenthood and a bitmoji version of a pink suit clad mrs clinton s 1995 speech on women s rights in beijing she will make a cameo in the third season of comedy central s broad city the sitcom about young women living in new york city and she published an ode to female musicians singling out among others gaga and missy and selena and demi in billboard magazine this month none of these women had success handed to her mrs clinton wrote they all had to keep at it even in the face of failure and discouragement jessica o connell the executive director of emily s list which raises money for female candidates who support abortion rights said younger women would become more enthusiastic about mrs clinton s candidacy when they engage more in the election and pay attention more to what the g o p is doing and how out of touch they are some of mrs clinton s younger supporters are already there taylor casey a 21 year old college senior said she was an ardent supporter of mrs clinton s when asked why she mentioned issues like college affordability criminal justice reform and conflict in the middle east asked about the excitement of electing a woman president ms casey shrugged if you put her in a man s body she would still be exactly what i want she said advertisement
