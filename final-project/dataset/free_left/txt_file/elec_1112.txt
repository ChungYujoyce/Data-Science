on a recent face the nation appearance marco rubio blamed donald trump s extraordinary success as a presidential candidate on you guessed it the media in his words the media coverage for donald trump has almost been cheerleading over the last couple weeks and i m convinced it s because many in the press want him to be nominee why because it would provide hillary clinton a clear shot to the oval office rubio then added so i think there s a kind of weird bias here in the media rooting for donald trump because they know he s the easiest republican to beat the notion that the so called lamestream media a neologism popularized by sarah palin has a liberal bias is as those of us on the left know widespread on the right but as those of us on the left also know it s simply false first of all as a 2015 article in politico notes fox news easily dominate s the cable news landscape it s the third most watched channel on tv and it has the top 14 most viewed cable news shows another survey reveals that fox news is by far the most trusted national news channel in america as hard as that may be for some to believe furthermore anyone with a functioning nervous system can see that fox news is an activist organization with strong conservative principles that effectively functions as a branch of the republican party its motto fair and balanced could hardly be more orwellian given the right wing lens through which it views world affairs it follows that american news is if anything conservative in its overall political orientation fox news is more popular influential and trusted than any other network in the country it is the lamestream media second if there s a discernible bias toward liberal views among other less watched news networks it s for one simple reason to borrow a phrase from the comedian stephen colbert reality has a well known liberal bias for example consider the persistent and widely held myth of american exceptionalism as i detail in a previous article for salon with respect to a huge range of life quality categories like prosperity happiness opportunity education health and so on the united states consistently fails to rank as one of the top 10best countries in the world in some cases for example with respect to childhood poverty we re barely even a developed country and as politifact recently confirmed the american dream is actually easier to fulfill in europe than it is in the contemporary u s the facts simply don t support the view that america is in the eloquent words of sean hannity the greatest best country god has ever given man on the face of the earth furthermore when it comes to issues like climate change environmental degradation torture taxes healthcare immigration racism and terrorism to name just a few reality clearly supports a progressive worldview the fact is that sea levels are rising due to greenhouse gases there s a serious problem of institutionalized racism among the police and trickle down economics doesn t work don t blame the messenger when verifiable claims about the world happen to support liberal persuasions rather than conservative ones and finally yes the media including fox news does have a single pervasive bias that colors its reporting of news events i ll admit that the venerable senator from florida is half correct but the bias isn t what conservatives are so stubbornly convinced that it is rubio himself seems to acknowledge the existence of this special bias when he says from the same conversation quoted above that one i think the media think that covering trump is going to be good for ratings stop right there rubio you nailed it as the social critic and comedian jon stewart once insightfully suggested during an interview with chris wallace the media is strongly biased towards apolitical phenomena like conflict and sensationalism is stewart right well i can hardly think of a better confirmation of his hypothesis than the media s incessant coverage of donald trump why does cnn ignore bernie sanders huge rallies but broadcast trump s incoherent ramblings about winning winning winning and china china china interspersed with references to violating the geneva conventions and bringing back waterboarding the answer isn t conspiratorial as rubio intimated there s no grand plan to get a democrat in the white house by pitting sanders or clinton against the highly unfavorable trump things are much simpler than this trump shaking a water bottle around and shouting it s rubio is just plain more entertaining than watching sanders discuss substantive issues that genuinely impact american life the media are in the business of maximizing profits and there s a lot more moneyto be made covering trump than sanders clinton rubio or cruz it s capitalism rubio you know the economic system that you so dearly cherish but there is a cynical background to this picture yes the american audience craves mindless inane entertainment over intricate discussions of arcane policy but a demagogue like trump wouldn t be possible if not for the impoverished culture of anti intellectualism that conservative media like fox news have worked so tirelessly to foment on the one hand at least seven studies to date show that fox news denizens constitute the most misinformed news audience in the country one study even found that fox news viewers are more misinformed than people who don t watch any news at all from climate change to obama s birthplace to the iraq war to obamacare conservatives are far more likely to hold demonstrably false beliefs often with tremendous unshakable confidence on the other hand and even more significantly fox news instills in its viewers a formidable distaste for critical thinking it encourages dogmatism while discouraging curiosity it teaches people to care more about what a belief says about the world than why one should accept it it propagates what philosophers would describe as bad epistemology this is incredibly dangerous to our country s future because critical thinking is the intellectual backbone of every functioning democracy the fact that trump is leading a pack of truth challenged white househopefuls is unambiguous evidence that our democracy is not functioning properly a dysfunctional democracy is of course exactly what fox news wants for the obvious reason that it makes controlling the masses of cognitively stunted voters much easier but then trump rolled in from left field with his billions of dollars and charismatic authoritarianism and quickly filled the vacuum of ignorance fear and gullibility that fox news and its media cohorts had diligently carved out for the past seven years so rubio is right that the media is biased but wrong that this bias is liberal perhaps rubio should start bullying the bully of bullies right back mocking trump s small hands and suggesting that trump wet his pants during one of the republican debates is a good start for sure but there are plenty of potential jokes that are being left untold by rubio and his fellow underdog candidates they could for example laugh about the greasy and tasteless trump steaks sold only by the sharper image make fun of trump for a cringe worthy incest joke about dating his daughter or encourage their followers to start referring to trump as drumpf a hilariously strange monosyllabic sound that was once his family s surname if rubio stoops down to trump s fourth grade level of interacting with his opponents he might just find himself with a bit more media attention phil torres is the founding director of the x
