advertisement supported by the tip sheet by matt flegenheimer and jonathan martin can republicans keep the house will democrats swipe the senate which state is being made great again with the next presidential visit it s monday oct 22 trump and cruz are friends again and there are 15 days until the midterm elections democrats hope for a mega wave on election day they may still get one but at present strategists in both parties tell us they see a democratic gain of 20 to 35 house seats as the likeliest outcome democrats need 23 to flip the chamber in the senate republican officials say they increasingly believe the party will net one seat and possibly several more adding to their 51 to 49 majority why two reasons they think the four g o p senate seats with serious races arizona nevada tennessee texas are now either tilting their way including at long last arizona or are at worst tossups the new york times upshot siena college polls on those four races indicate the same and there s a sense among republicans that among democratic held senate seats they are virtually certain to pick up north dakota and missouri florida leans slightly their way and indiana and montana are very much on the table democratic officials concede their odds of winning north dakota are long and their optimism from september about taking over the senate faded but they are not ready to write off missouri and they dispute the republican thinking about florida and arizona and nevada are still in reach democrats took heart in the strong first day of early voting in nevada there is one state on which both sides agree tennessee despite some polls that showed republicans enjoying a post kavanaugh bounce remains a real race for the open senate seat president trump is in houston on monday for a rally at 7 30 p m eastern with senator ted cruz who once called him a pathological liar and serial philanderer in the senator s defense mr trump implicated mr cruz s father in the kennedy assassination without evidence politics is fun mr trump sounds lately like a man who thinks he has a winning hand he is attacking the migrant caravan relentlessly as republicans search for an issue to counter the democratic focus on protecting pre existing conditions coverage on the campaign trail we still hear more from voters about health care than migrants though immigration was all people were asking about at one recent republican forum transcript florida singing sunshine and sea breeze soft sand and palm trees retirement mecca party central little haiti little havana a state with elections so close they re legendary and in 2018 florida is living up to its reputation with a tight governor s race catering to political extremes a lefty mayor from tallahassee are y all ready to flip florida blue versus a trump loving former congressman make america great again the result could be a litmus test for where the state and maybe even the country are headed in 2020 so who are the candidates this is the democrat mayor andrew gillum he pulled off a surprise victory in the primary beating out six other candidates my wife refers to me as seabiscuit gillum s got that made for media inspiring back story he s one of seven kids the first to graduate from high school and college and he was the youngest person ever elected to the tallahassee city commission gillum could be florida s first black governor he s become a bit of a national star but he s also wrapped up in some controversies an ongoing corruption probe since you ve been mayor we want to make sure that any individual that participated in that is held fully accountable the republican ron desantis he made a name for himself by appearing on fox news a lot put up or shut up desantis a self described conservative warrior has impressed many republicans including trump a tough brilliant cookie he s got ivy league credentials and served in the military jag officer desantis went to congress in 2012 but recently resigned so he could focus on his campaign he s also had some stumbles like when he said this about gillum the morning after the primaries you know he is an articulate spokesman for those far left views the last thing we need to do is to monkey this up yeah it drew accusations of a racist dog whistle so what about the issues desantis has endorsed almost every trump policy from repealing the affordable care act to moving the u s embassy to jerusalem he also hates tax increases and so called sanctuary cities gillum he might be the most liberal candidate for governor in florida s history he wants to overhaul i c e raise the minimum wage and fight the n r a polls show that both messages are getting pretty good reception in florida so yeah of course the race is neck and neck this is florida the rules are different here stooge failed mayor let no one accuse the next florida governor whoever it is of a sass deficiency the debate sunday night between andrew gillum the progressive democratic mayor of tallahassee and ron desantis a trump loving former republican congressman had a little bit of everything discussions of race and toxic algae israel and health care takeaways there was no knockout moment mr desantis who has been behind in some polls tried to cut mr gillum down to size he kept calling him andrew and accusing him of letting crime run rampant in the capital mr gillum who mostly called his rival mr desantis or the congressman mocked his opponent s fealty to the president and made pointed allusions to racially charged comments by mr desantis i m a hard working person i know that may not fit your description of what you think people like me do but i work hard for everything that i ve gotten in my life andrew gillum it was a strong flourish for mr gillum on a night when he was under near constant attack from mr desantis who came across as well not desperate but very driven to paint mr gillum as the worst mayor ever even though mr desantis was caught on a live mic afterward telling mr gillum you re a good guy our new poll of the florida senate race is expected to begin this week a recent cnn poll had senator bill nelson the democrat slightly ahead while
