sorry but sanders doesn t think like mainstream black voters the tell is cornel west he hates obama we do not iowa and new hampshire had their turns in the spotlight and nevada comes this saturday and a week after that my state south carolina will host its own democratic primary compared to those first two states ours is highly diverse battle ground trial phase call it what you will south carolina once a crucible of the civil rights movement and barack obama s surge can help vet the candidate best aligned with the black community bernie sanders is not that candidate not next to hillary clinton from his bouts with the president to the laws he contested to the company he keeps sanders raises alarm bells for obama supporters especially those from the african american community back in 2012 while still a proud independent sanders took a page from the republican playbook and called for a primary challenge to obama s presidency his aim to contrast a progressive agenda as opposed to what obama is doing as if to say affordable health care and safe cities are not progressive enough goals the democrats i know would disagree that anti obama jab followed an earlier resistance to the affordable care act now considered president obama s greatest legacy back in 2009 coming from the far left wing sanders held out on voting yes hoping instead for an impossible ideal over 200 000 south carolinians now have quality affordable health insurance through obamacare if sanders fulfills his campaign promise and starts those talks from a blank slate then he risks undoing years of progress improving health care matters greatly to our community it s no secret that african americans die earlier than whites and suffer in larger numbers from diseases like diabetes and heart disease we also die twice as often from gun violence in charleston county alone blacks accounted for 29 percent of the population in 2014 but claimed 78 percent of gun violence deaths we demand equality where our lives are at stake and on that note sanders has a mixed record on gun safety having opposed reforms that obama now pushes the vermont senator once voted for legislation that allowed the charleston shooter to buy a gun despite a clerical error the now infamous charleston loophole more recently he voted down legislation meant to shield gun makers from victim lawsuits when president obama last month refused to back any candidate even in my own party who does not support common sense gun reform he may well have been referring to sanders in what perhaps struck the candidate as an act of solidarity sanders also chose cornel west as liaison to south carolina s black voters as the washington post puts it west serves as sanders s controversial traveling companion and has been highly critical of president obama that s an understatement cornel west hates president obama he once called the president a brown faced clinton a rockefeller republican in blackface and a counterfeit progressive my own father cleveland sellers was a real civil rights era activist as were jesse jackson and rev joseph a darby all of them are alive and well with deep south carolina roots and could have been surrogates for sen sanders so of all the black leaders sanders could have chosen why west west is a scholar sure but his views are extreme and they clash with much of the pro obama black community bernie sanders means well and his calls for income equality rightly resonate with democratic voters but certain issues gun violence and health care among them and certain viewpoints cornel west s not among them appeal specifically to most african americans my vote goes to someone who supports president obama and intends to wholly and ambitiously build on his legacy that someone is not bernie sanders
