one of the benefits of media outlets polling on the same question over and over is that it allows us to see trends was that too earth shattering a revelation for your monday morning too bad in the new cnn orc poll out monday two trends are clear first in the murky republican field marco rubio and scott walker have seen the best continued improvement and second no one of either party is getting very close to hillary clinton here s how the republican field has evolved in several cases you can see surges tied to campaign roll outs jeb bush s big jump in december followed his announced exploration of a bid and ted cruz and rubio saw jumps since last month we ll note that the margin of error on this is fairly large at 4 5 percentage points rendering most of these movements statistically insignificant such is and will continue to be the case with such a crowded field if you look how each candidate s poll numbers have changed between polls and average them you can see walker and rubio with the best consistent growth the big loser by that metric is ben carson trailed closely by chris christie on the democratic side hey did you hear that hillary clinton decided to run yeah i know we were shocked too biden is in second in the sense that a sheboygan hardee s would come in second to fallingwater in a two entrant architecture competition but the bit that s captured a fair amount of attention this morning is how republicans compare to clinton which can be summarized with the word poorly the drop off against clinton you see in april is probably in part a function of clinton s roll out last week the poll was conducted april 16 19 as we said campaign launches get attention what s probably more important to note is that clinton s national lead is smaller in other national polls and in some individual states republicans occasionally hold a lead if the election were held today right this minute hillary clinton would probably be our next president but it is not held today despite what the volume of 2016 stories might lead you to believe many americans have paid zero attention to the still hundreds of days away contest and no one on either side has done much campaigning so place a bet on a winner if you want but don t be surprised if it doesn t pay out
