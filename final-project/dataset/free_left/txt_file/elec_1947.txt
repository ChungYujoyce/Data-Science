biden s gaffes are being seen through a new lens his age campaigning in new hampshire over the weekend former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate joe biden talked himself into another news cycle about his gaffes he confused the first primary state for neighboring vermont then he forgot where he had spoken on dartmouth college s campus just hours before i want to be clear i m not going nuts he told reporters according to the los angeles times i m not sure whether it was the medical school or where the hell i spoke but it was on the campus on some level this is nothing new for biden who has a history of slipping up and saying things that are slightly off or need clarification and it s true that the grind of the campaign trail which puts candidates on a tireless schedule between states and time zones with little downtime can be brutal for anyone but biden s off the cuff rough around the edges brand is being seen through a new lens in this presidential primary for the democratic nomination his age i am in my 70s and i know they are in their 70s and i couldn t handle that no way carol rork a 79 year old resident of britt iowa told vox after the wing ding dinner where biden spoke in early august an april poll from reuters ipsos found more than half of democrats were less likely to support a presidential candidate over age 70 biden s campaign chalks it up to a press hungry for a juicy headline biden himself has attributed the coverage of his gaffes to his frontrunner status he has held a comfortable lead in early polls ever since jumping into the race according to the realclearpolitics polling average that said his campaign is acknowledging the narrative the campaign tweeted a video in which an iowa voter told biden that his fiery speech quelled any initial concerns she had about his age biden at 76 isn t the oldest candidate in the current field that distinction goes to bernie sanders who will be 79 by election day 2020 but voters are increasingly questioning how old is too old to be president biden s age comes up with voters on the campaign trail numerous voters in iowa and new hampshire told vox he s too old when asked whether they were considering biden i hate to say it but you need someone younger he s my age dawn bassett 72 of kanawha iowa said of biden i liked biden as vice president but joe has seen his days i think he s too old sarah morris of waterford vermont said at an elizabeth warren event in new hampshire looking for a quick way to keep up with the never ending news cycle host sean rameswaram will guide you through the most important stories at the end of each day subscribe on apple podcasts spotify overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts and while several recent polls have found biden still in the lead including a morning consult 2020 poll released monday night which showed him at 33 percent a full 13 points ahead of sanders his closest challenger a few other recent polls have shown the 2020 race turning into a three way tie between biden warren and sanders it s not an issue of numerical age but it s an issue of how you act and do you look like you re up to the job and that s why you re not hearing about sanders said monmouth university polling director patrick murray a february nbc wall street journal poll showed 62 percent of voters said they had reservations or were very uncomfortable voting for a candidate over the age of 75 and a pew research center poll conducted in may showed just 3 percent of democrats and democratic leaning independents saying the 70s are the best age for a president it s worth noting that biden sanders and warren are all in their 70s the biden campaign is seemingly aware of this concern they recently released a video on twitter of him talking to an unnamed iowa voter who tells biden she wants to vote for a presidential candidate younger than she is but when you got to the passionate fiery part of your speech i stopped worrying she says in the video we have to remember who we are this is the united states of america there is not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together pic twitter com ala3yqf2gd other voters aren t so sure i don t think he can take on trump for that reason i don t think biden is quick enough and sharp enough to take him on campton new hampshire voter lizzy berube told vox at a recent warren event in new hampshire his story is incredible but he s just too old frequent news about biden s gaffes has fueled these fears among voters in the key early states of iowa and new hampshire especially as voters consider a potential general election matchup between the former vice president and trump who has already bestowed biden with the nickname sleepy joe others concerned with biden s age said it had less to do with gaffes than with the perception that biden is out of touch with the current democratic party because he is staunchly moderate and has some controversial past votes on racial issues of course it s worth noting that close to 40 percent of democrats identify as moderates initially i really liked him but his actions and his voting history tainted that said kacey marsh of whitefield new hampshire who is supporting the 77 year old sanders marsh said she didn t think age mattered too much adding age is a number it s relative i really don t want to vote for biden said a younger voter rory o neil of nashua new hampshire i don t like his blanket non apologies i think biden represents old moderate democratic norms many voters told vox that biden s years of experience in washington could be considered an argument in favor of electing him president he s a creature of washington he has loads and loads of experience said colebrook new hampshire voter john jolles but he echoed other voters concern that biden s age could also be considered an electoral weakness biden has always been known for going off the cuff and saying things that get him into trouble during his short lived 2008 presidential campaign biden famously called barack obama the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy biden later apologized for the remark and would eventually go on to be obama s running mate the same year he asked a paraplegic wheelchair using state senator from missouri to stand up at a campaign rally and in 2012 biden told an audience of mostly black voters that the republican party would put them in chains but recently another narrative has come to define his campaign a series of misspeaks and controversial comments that have raised questions about the possible effects of his age there was the time he waxed nostalgic about working with segregationist senators during his early days in the senate which california sen kamala harris weaponized against him in the first democratic debate one of the few times he saw a dip in the polls biden has repeatedly referred to former british prime minister theresa may as the late margaret thatcher he said he met with school shooting survivors from parkland florida as vice president though the shooting happened in 2018 well after biden left office after the recent mass shootings in el paso texas and dayton ohio biden appeared to mix up those locations before he caught himself gaffes have always been part of biden s public image well before this latest presidential run his unscripted nature is a big part of his political persona and he s had a habit of making news for a slip of the tongue in years past the big difference now is that biden is the frontrunner for the democratic nomination for president with each misspeak front and center so far the gaffes haven t sunk him in the polls he has sat somewhat comfortably in the lead 10 points ahead of the rest of the field in the polling average but recent polls have shown the primary looking increasingly like a three way race between him sanders and warren who have their own electability hurdles sanders is also getting questions about age during a recent swing through new hampshire one voter directly asked him about the fact that he s nearing 80 years and about his health as voters continue to prioritize electability or the ability to beat trump each slip up is getting scrutinized heavily he s making more unforced errors than sanders has said university of new hampshire pollster andy smith of biden if biden s message is i m electable you have to be able to demonstrate that he s given supporters cause to be concerned and given opponents an opportunity to go after him biden s candidacy is based on the premise that he s the most electable candidate the big question is whether voters concerns about age will cut into his support down the line at a separate recent campaign stop in new hampshire biden s wife dr jill biden flat out told voters they should consider her husband because he had the best chance to beat trump i know that not all of you are committed to my husband and i respect that but i want you to think about your candidate his or her electability and who s going to win this race she said you know you may like another candidate better but you have to look at who s going to win joe is that person unlike warren the plans candidate and sanders the political revolution candidate the biggest part of biden s pitch to voters is that he has the best shot of unseating trump in a general election and returning america to the normalcy it enjoyed in the pre trump era that biden as obama s vice president embodies this political message may be all the more salient considering sanders and warren are biden s biggest competition right now and both are seen as considerably more progressive than him but biden s electability message also has an inherent weakness if voters start thinking he s not as electable as he says he is his pitch sounds hollow the moment he s shown not to be electable since they have no other reason to be attached to joe biden it s easy to move these voters to someone else at least temporarily murray the monmouth pollster told vox it s a feedback loop that can be seen in a monmouth university poll released monday that found a three way tie between biden sanders and warren a necessary caveat about this poll is its small sample size the monmouth poll showed biden s support had dropped among moderate and conservative leaning voters who redistributed themselves fairly evenly among sanders and warren that s in part owing to voters starting to pay attention to media coverage which these days includes a fair amount of biden s gaffes murray told vox biden s early support has been built with name recognition among voters who have not been paying a lot of attention murray told vox as support for biden seems to be getting shakier
