republican presidential race governors chris christie john kasich and former governor jeb bush all delivered their strongest debate performances yet saturday night in new hampshire but the object of their attacks was not donald trump the irascible billionaire who maintains a double digit lead in the primary state instead they focused their fire on marco rubio turning his aggressively rehearsed talking points against him and exposing the vacuity of his campaign in a series of devastating exchanges that threaten to blunt his recent momentum rubio has long faced criticism for his robotic approach on the campaign trail where he regularly reproduces the same practiced phrases there is something to be said for staying on message especially when that message appears to be working but the florida senator s reliance on pre scripted lines backfired dramatically when christie called him out for using the same line twice and rubio responded like a broken record by repeating it again and again let s dispel once and for all with this fiction that barack obama doesn t know what he s doing he knows exactly what he s doing rubio said early in the debate arguing that obama far from being incompetent was actually engaged in a systematic effort to change america and that he would do a better job a president christie ripped the answer calling rubio inexperienced and drawing applause for accusing him of truancy in the senate rubio shot back that new jersey s credit rating had been downgraded nine times under christie then inexplicably he repeated his previous answer but i would add this let s dispel with this fiction that barack obama doesn t know what he s doing he knows exactly what he s doing christie pounced that s what washington d c does he said deconstructing the rubio machine in real time the drive by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25 second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him the crowd went wild as christie twisted the knife see marco marco the thing is this when you re president of the united states when you re a governor of a state the memorized 30 second speech where you talk about how great america is at the end of it doesn t solve one problem for one person rubio appeared to panic almost immediately returning to the same line a third time here s the bottom line this notion that barack obama doesn t know what he s doing is just not true he knows exactly what he s doing there it is christie interjected the memorized 25 second speech there it is everybody rubio unsure how to respond went for round four i think this is an important point we have to understand what we re going through here we are not facing a president that doesn t know what he s doing he knows what he is doing christie quipped that he gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points but that didn t stop rubio from repeating the line a fifth time before the debate ended i think anyone who believes that barack obama isn t doing what he s doing on purpose doesn t understand what we re dealing with here he said apparently still rattled this is a president this is a president who is trying to change this country it was a bizarre performance for the freshman senator who has soared to second in the polls in new hampshire after a surprisingly strong third place finish in the iowa caucuses last week in the last several days the republican establishment has rallied to rubio s side seeing him as the sole candidate capable of mounting a credible challenge to trump and ted cruz both of whom are considered unelectable by many party leaders but with the new hampshire primary just days away the confidence shattering exchange could derail rubio s shot at holding on to his second place position creating an opening for christie kasich or bush to pull ahead and prolonging an already damaging intra party fight to consolidate the crowded establishment lane rubio wasn t the only one to come under attack saturday night in what is certainly a first in the history of presidential debates donald trump lashed out at the audience after he was booed for trying to shush jeb bush that s all of his donors and special interests out there he said like a stand up comedian taking on a heckler that s who it is he continued as the crowd grew louder the r n c told us we have all donors in the audience and the reason they re not loving me excuse me the reason they re not loving me is i don t want their money i m going to do the right thing for the american public i don t want their money i don t need their money and i m the only one up here that can say that will be used in accordance with our privacy policy more from vanity fair contact 2020 cond nast all rights reserved use of this
