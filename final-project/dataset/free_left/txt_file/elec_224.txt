the two men could not be more different one grew up poor andblack in detroit the other rich and white in queens one is soft spoken and spiritual the other loud and caustic each epitomizes american success though in vastly different arenas one as a brain surgeon the other as a celebrity deal maker but together ben carson and donald trump stand as the dominant republican candidates for president their rise and durability polls show that combined they have the support of 50percent or more of gop voters have befuddled political elites and become the defining dynamic heading into the next debate wednesday in boulder colo for months such rivals as jeb bush marco rubio and ted cruz have assumed that voters eventually will get serious the outsiders stars will flicker out and the real politicians will assume control yet it is late october and that has not happened by delivering sharp visceral messages that galvanize the angry electorate carson and trump today are monopolizing the race more than ever the two outsiders have put a blanket over everybody else said doug gross a republican establishment figure in iowa nobody else can even get oxygen the relationship between carson 64 and trump 69 has zigzagged from cordial to chummy to cool they see themselves as kindred spirits so much so that trump has said he would consider carson as his vice president each has resisted bludgeoning the other but with tensions rising as the kickoff iowa caucuses draw near they are starting to take each other on after fresh polls last week showed carson leapfrogging trump for the lead in iowa trump went on the attack we have a breaking story donald trump has fallen to second place behind ben carson trump announced friday night at a rowdy miami rally pausing for dramatic effect he added we informed ben but he was sleeping carson is super low energy we need tremendous energy trump thundered prompting his supporters to break into chants of usa usa he also said carson could not create jobs and negotiate trade deals carson shot back saying at a saturday event in iowa my energy levels are perfectly fine there have been many times where i ve operated 12 15 20 hours and that requires a lot of energy doesn t require a lot of jumping up and down and screaming but it does require a lot of concentration trump made the same low energy attack over and over against bush this summer and it was a devastating blow to the former florida governor and onetime establishment front runner bush downsizes in the face of trump strength trump kept it up saturday in jacksonville fla saying at a riverfront rally carson is lower energy than bush i don t understand what s going on he also singled out carson s seventh day adventist faith i m presbyterian boy that s down the middle of the road folks in all fairness trump said i mean seventh day adventist i don t know about i just don t know about carson is prepared for an onslaught from trump his advisers said it s a presidential campaign in the united states of america yes we expect it carson spokesman doug watts said we look forward to him making his point of view with the public and ifhedoes stir it up we re all outsiders and anti washington anti establishment so i think there s going to be a commonality there carson plans to take a deliberately gentle approach to his flamboyant foe said armstrong williams carson s confidant and business manager think about it parents children employees they don t want a boss or a president who is going to fly off the handle and throw insults at people williams said people expect you to have a certain level of class and dignity wealth does not give you class it does not give you temperament or discipline the other candidates have seemed hapless however in taking on trump at first many refused to criticize him now they regularly take potshots at trump but risk coming across as desperate attacking carson could also prove difficult for trump or any other candidate in last week s washington post abc news poll 64percent of republicans nationally said that the more they heard about carson the more they liked him a higher percentage than for any other candidate in the survey in iowa a des moines register bloomberg politics poll released friday found carson with the highest favorability 84percent of likely republican caucus goers the same poll had carson surging past trump 28percent to 19percent carson is kind of an unassailable candidate said steve deace a conservative radio host who is supporting cruz the texas senator even if people don t think carson is ready to lead they still see him as a symbol of what we once were and should be again the kind of country that produces ben carsons in the media carson has come under fire for controversial comments including his remarks that muslims should not be allowed to serve as president and that adolf hitler might have been stopped had the german public been armed but the iowa poll showed voters agreeing on these points what we ve found is that he s not popular in spite of these vivid things he s said he s popular because of them said j ann selzer who conducted the survey it s not just trump voter anger fuels outside candidates because of carson s popularity top republicans say taking him down will require precision and care i don t think that you need to attack him you just need to examine him gross said while he has an awesome bedside manner for a sick patient you really wouldn t ask a politician to do brain surgery would you ask a brain surgeon to fix the country after raising more money in the most recent quarter than any other republican candidate carson began a television advertising blitz in the four early states last week watts said the campaign will stay on the air through the spring and is reserving time in states with march contests so far his spots are positive introductory messages that end with his slogan heal inspire revive earlier this month trump told the washington post that he would spend upward of 20million on tv ads and was developing concepts with a florida based media firm reacting to carson s rise trump s allies are urging him to air his own ads immediately now is the moment we knew was going to come said roger stone a former trump adviser he needs to get on the air the whole point of political messaging is repetition and if carson continues to rise in places and negative ads begin to air against trump doing a one time shot on morning joe to counter it won t be enough the emerging skirmish is not the first between carson and trump carson who built a powerful following with evangelicals stunned trump in early september when he questioned trump s faith he said trump did not appear to have the humility and the fear of the lord trump counter punched mocking the famed neurosurgeon as a mediocre everyday doctor who has only hired one nurse almost immediately they patched things up we didn t want that fight said corey lewandowski trump s campaign manager it was an isolated incident really we ve moved on as carson bashes obama many blacks see a hero s legacy fade since then trump and carson labored to avoid another clash their campaigns were allies in negotiating the conditions with cnbc for this week s debate phone calls and e mails between the camps are friendly signaling not so much an alliance as a bond between the cycle s most unorthodox candidates we ve hit a chord and we re not as different as people think trump told cnn this past week he speculated about sharing the republican ticket with carson stranger things have happened trump and carson s relationship predated the campaign they are neighbors in west palm beach fla where associates introduced them their first extended exchange was at a dinner in april 2013 shortly after carson and his wife candy moved from their longtime home in maryland the carsons envisioned a peaceful retirement in the columned mansion they bought on the 17th hole at the elite ibis golf and country club trump s luxury mar a lago golf resort was a 15 minute drive away and at the urging of newsmax editor christopher ruddy a mutual friend trump invited the carsons over for dinner two months prior carson lighted up the political right by criticizing president obama at the national prayer breakfast at mar a lago the carsons trump and ruddy mingled with dror paley a canadian orthopedic surgeon and children who have health issues during the dinner trump and carson talked about carson s move his career in medicine and trump s various activities they discussed carson s speech about obama the country was in trouble they agreed and obama s presidency was a disaster but their connection ended there according to williams they didn t get into family values and struggles he said these kinds of conversations can sometimes feel like a production like meeting an image and a brand asked to assess the candidates rapport lewandowski was circumspect they respect each other he said but
