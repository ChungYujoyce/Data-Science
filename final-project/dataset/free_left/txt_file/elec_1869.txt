a 5 point swing in cumulative votes relative to 2016 tuesday night s california primary election results confirm that as best we can tell democrats are on track to secure a narrow house majority in the 2018 midterms here s how we know under california s top two primary system it s possible to look at any given district and see the total number of votes for the republican candidates and for the democratic candidates in the crowded ca 49 primary for example republican candidates as a whole netted 48 percent of the vote to democrats 51 percent some absentee votes are still being counted and the democratic share will likely rise somewhat we know from history that there s a systematic relationship between the cumulative primary ballot performance and general election performance in november with democrats usually doing a percentage point or two better in the general election because that s when more young people vote based on how democrats performed overall in the primary we can project what california s general election results will probably look like and even though california is obviously not a microcosm of the entire united states there is a systematic relationship between the state s election results and national results the way nate cohn calculated it for the upshot democrats would be favored to win control of the house if they could gain an average of 4 5 points across the country according to our estimates a 3 5 point improvement between the 2016 general election and the california top two primary results might put them on track to do so and guess what across the seven key targeted races democrats secured an average swing of 5 points enough to be favored for the majority in the 7 seats democrats are targeting in ca their margin in last night s primary votes is up over 2016 primary ballots ca49 up 9 ca48 up 6 ca39 up 11 ca45 up 11 ca25 up 6 ca10 up 12 ca21 down 20 projecting to nov ds are ahead in 49 25 and 10 now to be clear using results in seven seats to project the outcome in 435 seats is a dangerous business there s a lot of uncertainty here and while the odds favor the democrats they do not do so overwhelmingly but this is about as good a method as looking at generic ballot polling it s significant that generic ballot polling also tells roughly the same story democrats are more likely than not to secure a narrow house majority but the odds are not overwhelming special election results again tell a similar story democrats have on average made big gains here though with a lot of variance from state to state but in special elections they have the luxury by definition of running in an open seat accounting for incumbency effects the large democratic edge in special elections translates to a small edge in the overall race get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
