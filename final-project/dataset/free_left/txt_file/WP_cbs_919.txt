the following is a transcript of an interview with senator tom cotton that aired sunday january 26 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan we now turn to arkansas republican senator tom cotton good morning and good to have you here senator senator tom cotton good to be on with you margaret margaret brennan you raised concerns earlier this week that china was giving misleading information about what s happening president trump has since thanked china for its transparency have your concerns abated sen cotton so margaret given china s record of dishonesty and incompetence when it comes to dealing with these public health emergencies like the sars outbreak in 2003 i think this is a case where an ounce of prevention truly does equal a pound of cure we know from the outsets earlier this month that local chinese authorities in wuhan and in the hubei province were not as forthcoming not as quick as they should be as we heard in the report xi jinping has now said they re going to try to centralize the response to this hopefully they ll be more transparent obviously things that are very fast breaking even since the president said what he did just a couple of days ago margaret brennan so you think they are getting more transparent sen cotton they re trying they re they re apparently moving that direction again margaret brennan ok sen cotton i think we should be skeptical of china because they have a history of dishonesty when it comes to these kind of outbreaks and this is a this is a very serious matter margaret brennan and they re putting in some travel restrictions internally but do you think as as you suggested in a letter earlier this week that there needs to be a ban on entry to the us from china sen cotton so so right now what the cdc has done is try to direct all air traffic from wuhan into a handful of american airports if that doesn t control the situation we may need to look at expanding that from all chinese traveling in the united states i also think it would be appropriate for the food and drug administration to expedite on an emergency basis approval for testing kits to state and local governments so you re not just depending on the federal government to test these things but again we need to get ahead of this problem and given china s record of dishonesty when it comes to these public health emergencies we truly do do need to use an ounce of prevention here rather than having to use a pound of a cure in a few months margaret brennan i want to ask you about politics here at home mitt romney one of your republican colleagues says he is likely to vote to call witnesses in the impeachment trial how many other republicans do you expect to vote to approve witnesses and evidence sen cotton i don t know margaret i m not going to vote to approve witnesses because the house democrats have had lots of witnesses we heard from them over and over and over again this week we don t need to prolong what s already taken five months of the american people s time the house democrats have not proven their case against donald trump we don t need to prolong this matter margaret brennan do sen cotton what we saw last margaret brennan do you have a sense though that there is a chance there could be witnesses sen cotton well i i don t margaret brennan will there be those four republicans crossing over sen cotton well i don t want to forecast the way other senators may vote but i would say the last five days have kind of been a microcosm of the last five months we listen to adam schiff drone on for three days and then the president s lawyers in just two hours demolish the case that he had made it demolished by looking margaret brennan they also had 24 hours over three days if they want sen cotton and i don t think they re going to use them the house democrats have presented using selective misrepresented quotes from tape using transcripts that were out of context or just generally fulminating about how enraged they are that donald trump is still the president margaret brennan you were scribbling notes during the trial some of our reporters in the room saw you doing that and i wonder since you say we should be getting this over with if you actually do have questions because senators do get to submit them and have them responded to in the next week do do you want anything sen cotton well i think margaret brennan answered sen cotton well we ll have 16 hours of questions margaret brennan right sen cotton so we ll have plenty of time for questions and margaret brennan do you have any sen cotton well i think given the house democrats presentation there are now real questions about joe biden and hunter biden s conduct i mean they spent hours trying to explain away what hunter biden did going to work for a corrupt ukrainian oligarch and joe biden intervening to get that oligarch fired just days after his house was raided by investigators margaret brennan but so sen cotton i think those are serious and legitimate questions margaret brennan but you would need to vote to approve witnesses to hear sen cotton well margaret brennan from the bidens which you just said you re sen cotton well i d like margaret brennan not going to do sen cotton i d like to hear what adam schiff has to say about those facts that he again glossed over that i know the white house counsel is going to present i don t think that margaret brennan but you re not going to vote sen cotton i don t think we need to see margaret brennan to approve witnesses sen cotton i i do not think that we need more witnesses or documents the house had 17 different witnesses we saw hours of their testimony this last week they have twenty eight thousand pages of documents they re not upset that they haven t had witnesses they re upset that their witnesses haven t said what they want them to say margaret brennan and i i want to just on the the biden front i know the president s lawyers do we do anticipate that they will talk about that in length at length let s talk about what they did already present on do you think it was a misstep for one of the president s lawyers jay sekulow to stand on the floor of the senate and repeat the conspiracy theory that ukraine meddled in the 2016 election sen cotton margaret that s not a conspiracy theory margaret brennan senator john thune one of your republican colleagues said he would sen cotton it s margaret brennan prefer that the lawyers not do that sen cotton but margaret brennan because this intelligence community concluded that it was russia that meddled sen cotton so margaret that s a democratic talking point margaret brennan this is what john thune one of the republican leaders said sen cotton it s the democratic talking point that the president and his lawyers have argued that it was ukraine who interfered in our elections not russia you can read the president s brief they make it very clear that yes you can accept that russia interfered in a systematic organized top down fashion in our election i say that i ve been part of the intelligence committee that s been investigating it for years you can also say that it s clear some ukrainian officials tried to influence the outcome of the election in 2016 margaret brennan but you re being sen cotton both of those things can be true margaret brennen precise in your words there and that was not what the president s sen cotton that s exactly margaret brennan lawyers said sen cotton i m i m saying exactly what margaret brennan on the floor of the senate sen cotton the president s brief says you can also say that countries like china and iran and north korea try to influence our election as well both of those things can be true margaret brennan but you do know that the trump appointed elections czar at the director of national intelligence said we do not assess that any other country influenced the united states election in 2016 on the scale of what the russians did that s an exact quote from shelby pierson sen cotton and that s but that that s consistent with my point i said on a scale of russia was top down organize systematic i mean that s margaret brennan so would you caution the president s lawyers sen cotton the ukrainian margaret brennan to be more precise sen cotton the ukrainian the ukrainian ambassador margaret brennen in their language then sen cotton margaret the ukrainian ambassador published an op ed saying that or criticizing donald trump margaret brennan sure sen cotton and defending hillary clinton these are not disputed facts margaret brennan policy difference sen cotton these are not disputed facts margaret brennan right but that s not what the president s lawyer said on the floor putting that aside for a moment what can we expect from the committee you sit on senate intelligence in terms of further reports on what russia as you just said did do in the 2016 election sen cotton we re we re going through the declassification process on many of these reports i i think we ll be releasing more information soon i expect one one more set of reports to come out later this year but one thing i think you ll see too is that when you look back at the 2016 election there s a lot that the obama administration could have done at an earlier stage to prevent russia from interfering to the extent that it did margaret brennan there is now this 90 minute long recording that cbs and other networks have where president trump speaks at length with two of rudy giuliani s business associates who were involved in that pressure campaign in ukraine we played some of it at the top of the show when the president says get rid of take her out the u s ambassador to ukraine given that the president previously said he didn t even know these men doesn t it trouble you that we now have recordings of him discussing this issue in ukraine with them sen cotton no margaret an and this reminds me a lot of what happened in the brett kavanaugh case when the democrats kept releasing supposed bombshells and i think all we re missing here is michael avenatti to come out and defend someone as well let s margaret brennan you don t think sen cotton let s look at margaret brennan this reporting is damaging in any way sen cotton let s look at the context of this report that video was more than a year before he asked maria ya yovanovitch to be removed and he was told in that video we just heard that she s running around kyiv bad mouthing you and saying that you re going to be impeached the president has the right to remove any ambassador for any reason or no reason margaret brennan yes he does sen cotton whatsoever an ambassador bad mouthing the president is a pretty sound reason to remove an ambassador and i would point out margaret brennan the president absolutely has the right to do that but sen cotton but i would point out margaret margaret brennan i think the question is why these business associates who have a financial and political interest in the matter were advising the president sen cotton i would but margaret brennan and he responded and said ok take her out sen cotton i would point out though that that video occurred more than a year after she was removed margaret brennan right sen cotton so it goes to show margaret brennan and she was standing in the way sen cotton but it goes to show margaret brennan of that pressure campaign is what she has testified to sen cotton but it goes to show the president he was not hasty he was not precipitous he didn t just act on the word of these people he waited more than a year and got more information as well so i i think the video again it reminds me a lot of what we saw in the kavanaugh controversy and i don t think it influences the votes of any senators that i ve heard margaret brennan well i want to ask you on another matter iran we now know from the pentagon that the number is 34 americans who were injured when iran filed fired those ballistic missiles into a a base and injured these americans the pentagon now says half of them are receiving treatment what is their status how serious are the sen cotton so margaret brennan injuries sen cotton so the military does a lot better job than it did 15 or 20 years ago when it comes to brain injuries you know when i was in iraq if your truck got blown up you went and got your eyes checked out were probably sent on your way do a much better job today than they did then but there s also a huge spec margaret brrennan i i want to play though here s how the president described it when he was asked about these injuries begin clip president trump i heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things but i would say and i can report it is not very serious end clip sen cotton so i i thi margaret brennan veterans groups are calling for the president to apologize should he apologize for calling it nothing serious sen cotton no i thi he s just descr he s not dismissing their injuries he s describing their injuries margaret brennan he said they re headaches and not very serious sen cotton i think he s describing their injuries he s not dismissing their injuries head injuries can be on anywhere margaret brennan he said headaches i don t consider them very serious sen cotton well that s like saying that having a flesh wound is not very serious than having a margaret brennan well veterans groups and i know you re a veteran and i know you sen cotton and veterans margaret brennan know people who have suffered from tbi sen cotton veterans can have a different point of view margaret brennan as do i don t you think it s serious that the president may need to apologize sen cotton no i mean if it isn t if they are in fact all these injuries are not serious if they re on the less serious side of the scale than the severe traumatic side of the scale the president is just describing what happened and i m not dismissing them margaret brennan so you consider tbi serious injury sen cotton yes margaret brennan ok sen cotton but it s again it s there s a big scale of that that can be you know returned to duty in one day margaret brennan ok sen cotton or have severe traumatic lasting injury margaret brennan ok sen cotton and i think he s describing thankfully what end of the scale that lies on margaret brennan senator cotton thank you for your time today sen cotton thank you margaret brennan we ll be back with one of the democrats arguing the case colorado congressman jason crow watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream
