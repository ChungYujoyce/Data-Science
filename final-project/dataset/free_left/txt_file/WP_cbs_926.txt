insurance they re not insured their jobs don t provide insurance for them they re on the front line they have families to support they have to pick even though they are working between buying groceries and medication paying a mortgage or rent or going to the doctor said state representative jean farmer butterfield we re talking about people who are tax burdened without medicaid expansion

ohio governor mike dewine ohio secretary of state frank larose and the ohio legislature for extending the vote by mail primary but noted that some changes with voting need to be implemented reportscbs news campaign reporter jack turman pepper said in a press call wednesday afternoon that there was some confusion around casting a provisional ballot with some inconsistent information between directives and posters that were sent out he said that some voters in some counties were able to cast provisional ballots while others in different counties were turned away that type of rule that type of directive that the following the basic law has to be consistent around the state pepper said that needs to be fixed for november whatever the shape of the election pepper also acknowledged that reforms need to be discussed between the legislature and the secretary of state s office to transition to a more effective vote by mail system if needed one of the reforms suggested is eliminating the application and sending ballots to registered voters with pre paid postage to return the ballots the current vote by mail process was designed for a vote by mail only as an option and as an option that people assumed would actually not be done by even a majority of voters pepper said if we are going to have only vote by mail i think it clearly with that comes the need for reforms to adjust to an only vote by mail election even with the challenges of transitioning to a vote by mail primary pepper said democratic voter turnout surpassed 2012 turnout among democratic primary voters over 860 000 ballots were cast in the 2020 democratic primary according to unofficial results posted on the secretary of state s website that number is expected to increase as more mail in ballots that are postmarked before or by april 27 are received i think it shows an underlying level of democratic enthusiasm even amid all these challenges pepper said in a statement voting rights advocates expressed disdain towards the state legislature for not providing county boards of elections and voters enough time to transition to a vote by mail primary camille wimbish the election administration director for ohio voice and ohio voter rights coalition coordinator said that ohioans had to make an impossible and unnecessary choice between choosing to vote or protecting their health elections are about people coming together to choose who gets to be in power wimbish said in a statement by throwing an election into dangerous chaos the legislature effectively did the inverse it chose which ohioans could and which could not vote for their leaders first published on april 29 2020 6 48 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know get the latest breaking
