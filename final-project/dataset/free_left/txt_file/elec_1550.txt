advertisement supported by by steve eder jeremy w peters and kitty bennett donald j trump mocks his opponents as low energy but his own campaign travel schedule is relatively sleepy he left his home base of new york for only 17 public events during a 30 day stretch after several months of doing mostly pop in pop out visits marco rubio recently made a five day swing through iowa the longest single stretch he had spent there but in the middle of it he took a sunday afternoon off to take in some football ben carson is not only running for president but he is trying to sell books too so for the first five days of november he ditched the campaign trail to go on tour to promote his latest one a hectic and draining travel schedule crammed with visits to cafes and community center basements shaking as many hands as possible has long been a necessary staple on the road to becoming president not this time around a day by day analysis of how the top tier republicans seeking the white house spent the crucial month of november reveals that in this campaign a strenuous itinerary does not necessarily translate to robust poll numbers jeb bush whose failure to connect with voters might normally suggest a lack of effort logged an impressive 50 public events or fund raisers in november sometimes touching down in three states in a single day but it is mr trump whose twitter fueled television interview heavy campaign is upending the conventional approach to running for president with the travel log that seems so inversely related to his success mr trump 69 has spent fewer days on the road than his rivals all while holding his grip on the top spot in the republican race known to be something of a homebody who prefers to sleep in his own bed mr trump is far more likely to be in manhattan on a given day or night even though he has his own boeing 757 not to mention hotels and resorts that brandish his gilded name from las vegas to miami to chicago when he does have to travel for an appearance mr trump has developed a way of getting in and out with precision the november itineraries for republican presidential candidates reflect robust travel schedules that reveal campaign strategy he tends to leave in the late afternoon from la guardia airport his destination is usually close to an airport with a runway long enough to handle a 757 at the event he speaks for about an hour and when he is finished he mingles for just a few minutes as his security detail lets a few people close enough for autographs and selfies then it is back home for the night came up i speak for 20 minutes then get the hell out of here mr trump said during a mid november forum in orlando fla a quick flight from another of his residences in palm beach mr rubio a florida senator has also perfected the campaign drop in mr rubio s days on the road are usually light on big public events like rallies or town halls according to the analysis which was based on the candidates public schedules news reports of their appearances and detailed itineraries provided by the campaigns in november he spent parts of 14 days in florida including a break for thanksgiving mr rubio 44 a father of four has said that he strives to spend as much time with his family as he can on the weekends and is often at church on sundays he almost never campaigns that day except to do a television interview an admitted football fanatic he is also loath to miss sunday games during his five day trip to iowa he watched football with his state chairman jack whitver a former wide receiver for iowa state in new hampshire mr rubio s thin public schedule has drawn snide criticism from the state s largest newspaper the union leader which has endorsed gov chris christie of new jersey marco marco where s rubio read the headline on an editorial last week his aides say he spends more time in private meetings with business leaders pastors and other community figures that they choose not to publicize it is his unseen schedule that tends to be busier like on nov 17 when he was in washington for a classified intelligence briefing then in new york and texas for fund raising if mr rubio who is consistently in the top four in polls and mr trump are examples of how little a candidate can pencil in on a public schedule and still do well mr bush is just the opposite the week of nov 9 was a typical one for him after spending the weekend in miami mr bush the 62 year old former florida governor flew to milwaukee for the republican debate which he prefaced with a fund raiser and a school choice program nearby the day after the debate wednesday he went to iowa for two town hall style meetings and a meet and greet with veterans then it was off to michigan on thursday for another town hall style gathering and a fund raising lunch by dinnertime he was in new hampshire for a house party and after an overnight stay there and another town hall meeting on friday morning he flew to florida for an event with the state republican party while mr bush is essentially free of the constraints of a day job others have had to balance their campaign obligations with official duties mr rubio for one has been chided for shirking his responsibilities as a senator missing more votes this year than any of his colleagues his schedules show that he spent just two days in washington in november the senate was in session for 10 days when he missed a vote on a military spending bill favored by conservatives he entered an explanation in the official record from the road in new hampshire saying that he would have voted yes one of his rivals senator ted cruz of texas was there to vote for the bill mr cruz spent six days in november working in washington introducing two bills and as chairman of two hearings among other things mr cruz who is 44 and has two young daughters has organized his itineraries to spend the middle of the week on senate business while campaigning on weekends two days after thanksgiving he was back in iowa the state where he has focused much of his attention with three visits last month and where he has steadily risen in polls mr cruz has densely packed days on the campaign trail scheduling as many as a half dozen public appearances and the days grow longer when he adds last minute stops dropping into a pizzeria or cafe like the senators mr christie has balanced his official schedule as governor of new jersey with an increasing emphasis on new hampshire although he still lags in polls in november mr christie 53 made three visits to the state including a three day 10 stop tour early in the month as he became a fixture in the state mr christie told a guest at a house party in bedford n h you ll be tired of me by the time this is over his time in new hampshire apparently unsettled mr trump who suggested that mr christie had abandoned his deeply troubled home state new jerseyans not happy mr trump wrote on twitter labeled super low energy by mr trump mr carson has maintained a schedule much like his candidacy that has been less conventional as he spent only a few hours in new hampshire to get his name on the primary ballot and was in iowa only briefly in november as he took a comparatively breezy approach to the crucial early primary states he devoted his face time elsewhere touching down in more than a dozen states as well as traveling to the middle east during the month once he wrapped up the book tour in florida in the first week of november mr carson boarded a jetblue flight to westchester then headed to connecticut for a saturday lunch meeting with henry a kissinger the former secretary of state and rupert murdoch a news media mogul according to his calendar that night he flew to san juan for a rally to support statehood for puerto rico which has a republican primary in march before turning his focus to that tuesday s debate in milwaukee despite the unusual approach mr carson 64 has maintained his status in the top tier of candidates though he has slipped a bit in recent polls he has not seemed particularly fazed by the pace of the race especially when he compares it with his time as a pediatric neurosurgeon this mr carson said in a november interview doesn t seem quite that bad advertisement
