risk intensifying an already fierce trade war with china the trump administration action is a grave escalation with china that at minimum plunges the prospect of continued trade negotiations into doubt analysts at eurasia group wrote in a report unless handled carefully this situation is likely to place u s and chinese companies at new risk here s a look at what happened and why it could open a dangerous new front in the dispute between the world s two largest economies mr trump on wednesday issued an executive order that bans u s phone carriers from using technology by foreign adversaries deemed to pose unacceptable risks to national security while the order doesn t name specific countries or companies it follows months of u s pressure on huawei and gives the commerce department 150 days to draft regulations the agency also expected to restrict zte another large chinese telecommunications company mr trump gave a reprieve to last year shortly after mr trump s order was signed the commerce department said it put huawei on a blacklist that could bar the company along with 70 affiliates from doing business with american companies that means huawei can t buy parts and components from american companies without u s government approval the u s has long worried that huawei s equipment could be used by beijing to conduct espionage activities claims the company denies huawei on thursday fired back via twitter saying the decision will do significant harm to the company s u s business partners and cost tens of thousands of american jobs the new curbs on huawei come less than two weeks after talks between the world s two biggest economies aimed striking a trade deal disintegrated mr trump unexpectedly raised tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports to 25 percent and said he is considering additional levies on every good the u s buys from china that came after the white house said china reneged on commitments it had previously agreed to during the trade talks china almost immediately retaliated with its own round of new tariffs tariffs already imposed on chinese imports will hurt u s consumers and companies most economists contend that s because companies that import the chinese goods pay the levies and tend to pass the higher cost onto customers oxford economics today estimates that the most recent escalation to 25 percent tariffs on 250 billion in chinese imports will cost each u s household 490 next year and cut america s economic growth by 0 3 huawei which capital economics notes accounts for roughly 0 2 of chinese gdp is one of china s flagship companies and a symbol of the country s aspirations to global tech leadership as outlined in its made in china 2025 plan mr trump and u s trade officials have singled out thatinitiative as a threat to american dominance in artificial intelligence robotics energy and other key sectors to that end the clampdown represents a battle between the u s and china over the future of5g the souped up telecom networks that promise speedier phones enhanced virtual and augmented reality the so calledinternet of things and other technological advances yet mr trump worries about the potential for espionage and who will get the technological upper hand in the race for 5g business those fears underline the growing competition between the u s and china for economic technological and even military influence with lawmakers across the political spectrum viewing china as america s greatest rival phone companies like huawei s networking and telecom equipment because of its lower cost and technological edge bloomberg notes but huawei also relies on american chipmakers to produce semiconductors and other components needed to run new wireless networks just two u s firms make 98 of the programmable chips used in 5g networks u s senator marco rubio said in a tweet thursday when they lose access to these chips huawei won t be able to offer an end to end option on the 5g network last year mr trump gave huawei rival zte a reprieve amid arguments that it violated sanctions on doing business with iran huawei is also accused of stealing intellectual property which critics say way for enhance beijing s ability to spy china has range of options it could use todisrupt u s companies from boeing to apple to gm that see the vast chinese market as a key to growth for example beijing could withhold licenses impose new taxes that raise the cost of doing business start regulatory investigations slow down customs clearances delay visa applications or use health and safety rules to stifle a company s operations the trump administration s actions likely invite retaliatory steps against u s companies operating in china and further complicate the path to resolution of the trade dispute ed mills an analyst at raymond james said in a report the u s move to blacklist of huawei doesn t take effect until the order is published in the federal register a record of all government actions the commerce department statement didn t give a timeline for when that could happen an invitation for chinese officials to strike a trade deal for the sanctions take effect the associated press and cbs news grace
