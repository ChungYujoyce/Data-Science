watch cbsn live by caitlin conant may 18 2020 7 46 pm cbs news president trump said he was surprised by attorney general william barr sdismissalon monday of his repeated claims that the russia inquiry was a plot of the obama administration according tocbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga mr obama and former vice president joe biden have come under attack by mr trump and his allies after biden was among a list of obama administration officials who requested intelligence reports that unmasked former national security adviser michael flynn s identity in 2016 and 2017 all of the officials named were authorized to see the unmasked reports the list of names was declassified by acting director of national intelligence richard grenell and made public by two republican senators last week i think obama and biden knew about it they were participants but so i m a little surprised by that statement mr trump told reporters in the white house monday afternoon the president later added so i think it s just a continuation of a double standard i m surprised by it i m surprised by it earlier in the day barr said an ongoing internal justice department review into the origins of the fbi s probe into mr trump and his 2016 presidential campaign is not expected to lead to a criminal investigation into mr obama or mr biden cbs news digital reporter melissa quinnsays barr made the comments during apress conferenceon monday during which he was asked about mr trump s recent suggestion that mr obama and his top officials committed crimes in the last few weeks of the previous administration barr provided an update about the ongoing investigation led by u s attorney john durham of connecticut who was selected by the attorney general to review the origins of the investigation into the trump campaign s ties to russia while some aspects of the matter are being examined as potential crimes barr said neither mr obama nor biden are expected to be prosecuted as to president obama and vice president biden whatever their level of involvement based on the information i have today i don t expect mr durham s work will lead to a criminal investigation of either man he said our concern over potential criminality is focused on others barr criticized the fbi and the country s intelligence apparatus for its investigation into ties between the trump campaign and russia saying they advanced a false and utterly baseless russian collusion narrative against the president while durham s probe will determine whether any federal laws were broken barr vowed it will not be used to target mr trump s political opponents this cannot be and it will not be a tit for tat exercise we are not going to lower the standards just to achieve a result he said barr said the november contest between mr trump and biden who is the presumptive democratic presidential nominee should be based on a robust debate of policy issues and we cannot allow this process to be hijacked by efforts to drum up criminal investigations of either candidate any investigation into either mr trump or biden barr added must receive his stamp of approval joe biden during a virtual gathering of the asian american pacific islander victory fund on monday biden accused mr trump of stoking anti aapi sentiment in the united states during the pandemic cbs news campaign reporter bo ericksonreports biden said that instead of a quick response to the virus we got denial delays distraction many of which were nakedly xenophobic biden continued the aapi community deserves better than a president who never misses an opportunity to stroke innuendo fan the flames of hate the former vice president cited the back and forth between cbs news white house correspondent weijia jiang and mr trump last week as an example you deserve better than a president who aggressively and childishly insults an asian american reporter biden told the forum think of that the president of the united states for the whole world to see insults an asian american reporter in the rose garden for doing her job asking a direct question while biden s remarks were very serious the presentation was right out of a veep episode biden is now out of his basement and is broadcasting from his porch the floor to ceiling doors behind him were open and at the beginning of his remarks biden proactively apologized for the loud canada geese out on the pond during the 13 minutes of remarks the geese honked so loud it was at many times hard to understand biden later during the forum senator kamala harris spoke highly about mr biden cbs news campaign reporter tim perryadds harris said there was a need to elect biden to stop mr trump and senator mitch mcconnell from nominating more conservative and unqualified judges to the courts she emphasized the supreme court and singled out justices brett kavanaugh and neil gorsuch by name she noted that biden was sworn in during his second term by justice sonia sotomayor she said it s not just enough to win the presidency but democrats must also win the senate as well to confirm judges appointed by joe biden president trump mr trump told reporters monday he has taken hydroxychloroquine

notify congress and provide a justification for the removal of an ig it is not sufficient for the president to say simply that he has lost confidence in the official rather when we wrote the 2008 law
