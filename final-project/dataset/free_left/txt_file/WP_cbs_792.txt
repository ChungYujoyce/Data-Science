delegates in six states ontuesday the most closely watched of these upcoming six states is michigan with 125 delegates it offers the biggest prize of the night in 2016 sanders scored a major surprise upset against hillary clinton by winning the majority of white voters though clinton won handily among black voters and women it is unclear whether sanders can replicate that victory this time around against biden like clinton biden has so far proven he has significant support among african americans and he is also more popular among working class white voters than clinton was a new poll frommonmouth universityreleased on monday showed biden with a commanding lead over sanders fifty one percent of likely democratic primary voters said they planned to support biden compared to 36 for sanders biden led sanders among white voters 50 to 36 voters of other races 53 to 36 voters age 50 and over 62 to 24 and women 53 to 33 sanders led biden among voters under 50 years old 49 to 38 and men 49 to 39 as of last week according to adetroit news wdivpoll absentee voters who had cast their votes also heavily favored biden over sanders pollster richard czubaestimated that biden can bank an almost 150 000 vote lead on sanders just through absentees michigan voters care most about beating president trump 39 3 health care was a distant second 18 5 the survey found sanders is making a big push in michigan having appeared at events in five different cities during the final weekend before tuesday s primary he went to the county where he suffered his biggest defeat in 2016 by vote total wayne county home of detroit and the county where he had his biggest win by vote total kent county where grand rapids is located he also stopped by the liberal haven of ann arbor to try to boost support from university of michigan students at a rally with one of highest profile supporters representative alexandria ocasio cortez young voters were critical to his success in 2016 in michigan and they re supporting him in large numbers so far in 2020 on the trail in michigan he has been vocal about trade continuing to hammer home the theme that biden has championed trade deals like nafta that many union voters view with suspicion turnout among african american voters will be closely watched though biden s ties to black voters have been proven in the contests so far turnout in michigan particularly in wayne county and the level of enthusiasm for him could be a key factor on tuesday suburban women are another key constituency for biden sanders has promised to expand the electorate with new voters but after a disappointing showing on super tuesday he has admitted some disappointment that the level of turnout is not what he had hoped for or anticipated michigan holds what s known as an open closed primary there is no party registration requirement in the state any person can vote in either party s primary but voters must ask for one party s ballot when they show up at the polls and identify in writing which political party they wish to vote with in the primary due to a 2018 ballot measure voters can vote absentee without providing a reason if a person voted absentee for a candidate who has since suspended his or her campaign that voter can change their vote if they submitted requests in writing by march 7 or appear in person by monday march 9 as of march 6 24 109 people had done this according to the michigan secretary of state s office michigan s results could take some time to tabulate as of march 5 about 90 more absentee ballots were sent compared to five days before the primary in 2016 nearly 600 000 absentee ballots had been cast as of that day the secretary of state has pushed michigan s legislature to change state law to allow clerks to process or count absentee ballots before election day sanders is expected to do well in idaho and north dakota both states with largely white and rural populations and both states he won in 2016 against clinton he is also polling high in washington state the last primary to close on tuesday but like california most of washington votes by mail so the results may not be known for some time mississippi mississippi also votes on tuesday it s a state that s expected to go big for biden given that it has an even larger african american democratic electorate than south carolina in 2016 71 of the democratic primary voters in the state were african american polls will be open between 8 a m and 8 p m et there is no early voting in the state absentee ballots had to be received by march 9 to be counted as of march 5 more than 15 000 voters had requested an absentee ballot for the march 10 election according to the secretary of state s office as of march 3 only 10 503 ballots have been received by the circuit clerks offices missouri in 2016 clinton had the support from key political figures and labor unions in the state but won the state by less than 1 500 votes exit polling said clinton won women with 54 but sanders won men with 56 sanders also won over voters under 44 while clinton had the backing of voters in the state 45 years old and up clinton also won 67 of black voters compared to sanders 32 but sanders won white voters 54 to 45 missouri is an open primary so voters can ask for any party s ballot on election day delegates will be allocated proportionally to the vote and the threshold for delegates is 15 missouri does not have early voting but allows absentee voting the period to request ballots ended last week and those ballots must either be received by the time polls close tuesday or submitted in person by monday according to the office of the missouri secretary of state 66 374 people had requested absentee ballots as of march 6 but a spokesperson for the

erickson says that with the latest endorsement booker s backing on monday morning a total of 10 former democratic presidential candidates have endorsed biden sanders currently has two from former 2020 rivals new york city mayor bill de blasio and marianne williamson while biden hopes to focus in the rust belt on his health care policy differences with sanders coronavirus has placed both the president and the democratic candidates under the spotlight i think there s no confidence in the president in anything he says or does biden told msnbc on monday i wish he d be quiet just let the experts speak and acknowledge whatever they suggest to him is what we should be doing bernie sanders sanders dodged a question today about taking personal precautions for his own health in the wake of coronavirus sayscbs news campaign reporter cara korte well i m surrounded by medical personnel sanders said referring to a panel of health care professional around him assembled for a campaign event on coronavirus thank you for asking i am running for president of the united states and that requires a whole lot of work he said sanders message on coronavirus is twofold first he said the trump administration s failure to embrace science is making the situation worse including the appointment of vice president mike pence as coronavirus czar during the panel discussion sanders read a quote from the president that suggested people should work through symptoms that might be the stupidest advice ever made by a president of the united states said sanders secondly folding in medicare for all sanders said a vaccine should be made free for everyone he also said a single payer system would lower the risks on contamination as people could to the doctor without fear of not affording care earlier monday at a rally in st louis sanders spoke the virus at length and just look at the insanity dealing with this coronavirus this very serious problem that we re dealing with in america dealing with all over the world think about the insanity of a system where today somebody wakes up and maybe they think they have the symptoms of coronavirus yet they cannot afford to go to a doctor what does that mean so they re gonna go to work and make a serious epidemic even worse he said michael bloomberg less than a week after suspending his presidential campaign billionaire and former new york mayor mike bloomberg is spending his own money to combat voter suppression cbs news campaign reporter tim perryconfirms bloomberg gave 2 million to collective future for african american voter registration this is not the first time bloomberg has spent his own wealth for this particular issue in december 2019 bloomberg announced a 5 million donation to stacey abrams new voter protective initiative this donation expands on bloomberg s commitment to register 500 000 voters from under represented groups in key swing states heading into november s general election voter suppression efforts across the country have been a barely disguised effort to keep black americans and other democratic leaning voters from the polls i ve always believed we need to make it easier for all citizens to register and vote not harder bloomberg said in a statement that s why i strongly support collective future in their effort to register 500 000 black americans these new voters could determine the november election and the future of the country the stakes couldn t be higher so while our campaign for the presidency is over our work to get america back on track is still growing a spokesperson for bloomberg told cbs news the money was transferred last week but the proposal had been in the works before bloomberg exited the race after a poor super tuesday showing cory booker senator cory booker of new jersey announced on monday he is endorsing biden for president sayscbs news campaign reporter jack turman in an email to supporters booker explained his decision to endorse biden joe is building the kind of campaign that will do more than remove one guy from one office the email reads he will lead the democratic party to victory in races up and down the ballot across the country this november in an interview with cbs this morning booker talked about the importance of unifying the democratic party ahead of tuesday s primary contests it is about time we start unifying as a party and begin the work to beat donald trump and frankly save our nation humanity address our common cause and our common challenges booker said pete buttigieg in his first television interview since suspending his presidential campaign pete buttigieg told nbc news the decision to drop out of the race was his own after being asked if the establishment pressured him to end his presidential bid look the kind of people who run for president of the united states are the kind of people who make their own decisions buttigieg said it was my decision cbs news campaign reporter jack turmansays buttigieg also announced that he will be guest hosting jimmy kimmel live on thursday he said that one of the guests on thursday is actor sir patrick stewart issues that matter trade there s atrade warraging between the top two democratic presidential contenders reportcbs news campaign reporters bo ericksonandcara korte since super tuesday left two main candidates standing last week sanders has made it a point at campaign stops to list the areas where he and biden disagree trade has taken center stage this week as the two menfight for delegatesin the industrial midwest though neither candidate has released a detailed trade policy a decisive primary win in michigan on tuesday or next week in ohio could signal how the democratic party will approach trade and the nation s economic agenda across one of the nation s most iconic manufacturing states sanders has been taking swipes at biden s positions on trade he slammed then senator biden s support of the 1993 north american free trade agreement nafta which eliminated most tariffs between the u s mexico and canada and the 2000 china trade bill which reinstated permanent and normal trade relations pntr with china sanders voted against both measures as a house member and continues to rail against the policies today a point highlighted by a sandersadcalled decimated that s up in every march 10 and march 17 primary state if we are going to defeat trump in michigan in pennsylvania and in wisconsin it will be very hard for a candidate who voted for these disastrous trade agreements sanders told a detroit crowd on friday this playbook may seem familiar to democrats since sanders waged a similar campaign against clinton in the 2016 democratic primaries in michigan he skewered her at a democratic debate held in flint michigan two days before the primary secretary clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate america nafta supported by the secretary cost us 800 000 jobs nationwide tens of thousands of jobs in the midwest permanent normal trade relations with china cost us millions of jobs he said at the time the argument helped sanders eke out a win over clinton in the great lakes state in a 1 5 point upset later mr trump too consistently criticized clinton over nafta and the trans pacific partnership sanders portrays his congressional votes opposing the trade deals as a matter of character i worked with the unions as a member of the house of representative to defeat nafta and to defeat pntr with china i can remember like it was yesterday being on a picket line in montpellier vermont in opposition to nafta i knew what it was gonna do i knew that you cannot ask american workers who are earning living wages to compete against the starvation wages being paid in mexico sanders said friday in detroit the senator hit the same note during campaign stops in michigan over weekend he said in flint on saturday that i heard during that period in the 90s i heard all of corporate america say you gotta vote for these trade agreements and all of the media said you gotta vote for these trade agreements i stood with the unions the working families of this country i voted against those agreements joe biden voted for those agreements the reviews of nafta are somewhat mixed and a new version of the deal the u s mexico canada trade agreement is expected to be implemented soon after canada ratifies it in 2013 the liberal think tankeconomic policy instituteprojected that nafta caused 20 years of stagnant wages and the upward redistribution of income wealth and political power at the same time foreign affairsestimates that 14 million american jobs still depend on nafta and a 2016 report from theu s international trade commissionconcluded the policy had essentially no effect on real wages in the united states of either skilled or unskilled workers biden has rarely brought up north american trade policy on the stump since the iowa caucuses where he would emphasize the impacts of the agricultural trade war with china instead he casts himself as an ally to workers and union members even though its some workers have fallen victim to the shift of u s production to cheaper alternatives in mexico asgeneral motorsdid in march 2019 eliminating 1 700 hourly jobs in ohio alone he stands by his nafta vote arguing that no it wasn t a mistake to vote in favor of the deal he said last may in iowa he has labeled himself a fair trader rather than a free trader he added we should treat other countries in a way they treat us just deciding it s all about trade deficit balancing we need to do more the most recent ripple in the trade debate has been the usmca agreement an idea then candidate barack obama pitchedin the 2008primary biden has said that in principle he supported the agreement due to the increased labor and environmental protections issues that he told cbs news in summer 2019 that he believed should have been more thoroughly addressed from the beginning of the nafta negotiation in the 1990s sandersunapologeticallyvoted against usmca stating that protections did not go far enough on this matter sanders stood alone his one time democratic adversaries criticized him for being too purist in his pursuit elizabeth warren once sanders fellow progressive in the race promised to support the usmca and bargain for a better deal if elected the distinction was noted by some in the rust belt frank hammer a retired 32 year general motors employee participated in a panel discussion on trade with sanders friday in detroit you were the singular sole candidate that said consistent with your past positions that you were opposed to usmca and i think that speaks volumes for the stance that you have taken on behalf of working class people and especially auto workers hammer said and i m so grateful thank you on the trail biden has dismissed china s status as an economic powerhouse pointing out basic challenges chinese leaders face like providing enough potable water for their people and boasting about the u s dominance in the future the idea that china is going to eat our lunch it s bizarre he said in iowa in late january suggesting that rather than viewing china as an existential threat the u s could help china with some of its problems the u s can compete with china and insist that they follow the rules he proposed unlike thesocial security adsthe biden campaign is running in michigan two biden advisers tell cbs news after reviewing their internal polling they decided to not engage sanders on the intra party trade war at this point i m not sure voters are looking for a vote by vote analysis one biden adviser told cbs news they re looking for a nominee others agree that focusing on trade even in michigan may not be as beneficial as sanders hopes i think it s a miscalculation from sanders justin wolfers professor of economics and public policy at the university of michigan told cbs news wolfers cited agalluppoll that shows 67 of self described democrats say that nafta has been beneficial for the united states wolfers said that with the mr trump s election everything is a little upside down in terms of trade politics because the gop incumbent has made a stronger pitch for protectionist voters than any democratic nominee is likely to make relatively speaking democrats are now the pro trade party wolfers added biden has a strong argument to make in michigan on manufacturing though since he had a leading role in helping to negotiate the obama administration s 2009 auto bailout of two of the big u s automakers general motors and chrysler just like the automobile industry came back detroit is going to come back biden saidin 2014 it s not only an important city but it s an iconic city it symbolizes the manufacturing might of the united states of america according to an invitationobtainedbycbs news campaign reporter adam brewster biden is expected to attend a high dollar fundraiser in michigan this week co hosted by cynthia and edsel ford the great grandson of henry ford california the california primary is far from over with more than 3 million ballots still left to count according to estimates published by the california secretary of state as of monday afternoon cbs news estimates sanders leads with 33 9 followed by biden at 26 6 sanders so far is estimated to win 185 delegates while biden is at 143 cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidarsays the millions of ballots that remain unprocessed are because of last minute voters those who either put their ballots in the mail on election day or who voted in person but decided to change their party registration on the spot this also includes ballots that were damaged had typos or required careful examination from a
