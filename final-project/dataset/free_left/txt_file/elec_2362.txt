to play a pivotal role in the democratic primaries after small dollar donors using actblue the democratic online fundraising platform financed the democratic house takeover and before that sen bernie sanders underdog 2016 presidential campaign potential candidates have spent months building up grassroots digital supporters to fund their campaigns in 2019 and build relationships with voters before they get the chance to go to the polls in 2020 advertisement sen kirsten gillibrand didn t air a single tv ad in her campaign for reelection in new york last year instead spending more than half her campaign budget with a firm specializing in digital fundraising sen kamala harris d calif dropped over 1 2 million on facebook ads targeting grassroots supporters nationwide since may 2018 the fifth most of any democrat even though harris wasn t running for anything last year sen elizabeth warren d mass received donations from people in all 50 states within hours of announcing her presidential exploratory committee on monday she told reporters the small dollar fundraising totals that candidates reap this year will be one of the few credible signs of momentum for candidates months before primary votes are cast in an era in which polls can bounce around wildly and media attention is split among dozens of candidates and a twitter happy president small contributions most of which will come in online will even be a benchmark for entrance into primary debates the democratic national committee said last month small dollar fundraising totals will be the new straw poll in 2019 said taryn rosenkranz a democratic digital consultant she added there are so many candidates running all with similar policy platforms meaning that small dollar donations will be one of the best measures

themselves apart as particularly high powered digital fundraisers gillibrand harris sanders warren and ahead of the rest former rep beto o rourke d texas whose 80 million 2018 senate run broke fundraising records all five received contributions from at least 200 000 unique online donors in 2017 and 2018 according to a politico analysis of federal election commission records filed by actblue the democratic online fundraising platform o rourke s senate campaign racked up over 700 000 unique donors via actblue gillibrand and warren each raised over 10 million online while running in noncompetitive senate races while o rourke warren and sanders whose 2016 presidential campaign raised nearly a quarter billion dollars rose to national prominence with prodigious support from small donors harris and gillibrand spent the past two years transforming their political operations so they are powered by online supporters who provided the majority of their campaign committees funding in that period small dollar donors are going to pick the democratic nominee said erin hill actblue s executive director because of the unprecedented volume of online money expected to flow to democrats in 2020 hill said she expects actblue to double its staff of 100 over the next two years we ve already seen candidates announcing their 2020 plans directly to online supporters hill said citing warren s decision to announce her exploratory committee in an email to her list warren has already made it clear that she ll use her commitment to grass roots fundraising as a wedge in a crowded primary warren told msnbc s rachel maddow on wednesday that democratic primary voters should say no to the billionaires whether they are self funding or funding pacs is this going to be a democratic primary that truly is a grassroots movement that is funded by the grassroots or is this something that s just going to be one more plaything that billionaires can buy warren said taking shots at former new york city mayor michael bloomberg and philanthropist tom steyer two ultra wealthy potential candidates elections by david siders the contrast could extend to non self funding candidates too sen cory booker d n j has also generated excitement for a potential presidential bid among democratic activists though he has not yet built the same following among online donors as his potential rivals fec records show but steve phillips a prominent democratic donor has already pledged to raise 10 million for a super pac to boost booker and other democratic candidates could benefit from super pac support as well meanwhile warren has rejected outside support as she did in her first political campaign in 2012 o rourke also rejected outside spending in his texas senate race a road map he could follow again in a potential presidential bid relying solely on small dollar donors presents its own risks that s scary said preston elliott a democratic consultant if you lose any momentum or there s a feeling you might lose momentum then that money can dry up very quickly yet if other candidates follow the warren and o rourke model then it certainly diminishes the power of the millionaire donor class said jordan wood political director of end citizens united a liberal group working to reform the campaign finance system the donors who write 2 700 checks and max out to candidates will still matter and be a part of their fundraising plan but they may not matter as much a majority of candidates will take an all of the above approach to fundraising out of necessity to support grueling expensive campaigns several digital strategists said they ll need to do it all grassroots fundraising and traditional fundraising said greg berlin a democratic digital consultant but that small dollar number more than any other contribution type signifies real momentum media by jason schwartz and david siders but the million dollar or maybe billion dollar question hangs in the air for 2020 candidates how will grassroots donors react to a vast field of candidates including several candidates they may have contributed to in the past nobody knows that yet berlin said some operatives warned that the prospective candidates are used to sending out an email and just raking in money for themselves but they could be in for a rude awakening said one prominent democratic fundraiser who was granted anonymity to discuss the issue candidly most donors will beg off giving for a month or two but if they do give now there will be no exclusivity on bundlers no exclusivity on big donors and there s not going to be any exclusivity on small dollar donors the fundraiser continued the competition for dollars will be fierce and it ll be playing out at a whole new intensity for the grassroots but hill actblue s executive director noted that the pool of democratic small dollar donors which exploded in size in 2018 could still grow sixty percent of actblue s donors in the 2018 cycle were first time givers hill said there s no ceiling on this scott bland contributed to this report correction a previous version of this story misidentified end citizens united political director jordan
