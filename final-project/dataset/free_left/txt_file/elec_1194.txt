donald trump in votes or delegates by the time he gets to the republican national convention in cleveland and he knows no one can stand him personally apart from several lovers who seem to exist mainly in the pipe dreams of the national enquirer but he has also swept up dozens more delegates than trump in the weeks since marco rubio left the race this gives him both increasing momentum and legitimacy both of which will be crucial in a potential contested convention if everything goes cruz s way he ll pull close to even with trump before cleveland and subsequently win the support of delegates for rubio and john kasich the second best option would come in the form of two rounds of voting with massive defections from trump after round one leading to a victorious cruz in round two cruz s supporters are increasingly optimistic that one of these outcomes will occur cruz for his part keeps plotting lugubriously crafting a plan for how to deal with each campaign in order to smooth his flight path into cleveland he is determined to lose no time in these relatively empty weeks which might be described as the ducks swimming around phase of the campaign quiet and boring on top but with furious paddling below the waterline the game now depends heavily on backroom maneuvering for delegates cruz s team is exceptionally disciplined and competent at this having mastered every arcane rule of the nominating process after being completely outplayed in colorado where cruz took all 34 delegates trump s convention manager denounced the cruz campaign s gestapo tactics for cruz that s a good sign despite all the tension and bitterness with trump cruz is too clever to alienate his campaign they have an alliance after all on one important aim keeping anyone else from becoming the nominee if convention procedures are honored then delegates must abide by rule 40 b which stipulates that only candidates who have won a majority of delegates in eight or more states may be presented for nomination that would eliminate kasich or some other white knight paul ryan seems to be out of the running and leaves only trump and cruz if the two men hold firm asking their delegates to uphold the rule then at least one of them will walk out the nominee sure cruz views trump as an uncontrolled mess but he knows the two can do business he also recognizes a fellow rascal and cannot get convincingly worked up about him unlike trump cruz thinks less about whether a line of attack is fair and more about whether it works and that applies to both outgoing and incoming fire it s all business cruz is also in touch with rubio who despite pledges to campaign across the country in a pickup truck to stop trump has not yet been spotted in a chevy dealership cruz knows that rubio actually does hate trump the belittlement was too much and would be happy to help cruz deprive him of the nomination provided key establishment figures give it their o k and they would for this reason rubio has made the unusual move of asking to hold on to his 173 delegates going into the convention cruz hasn t decided what to offer in compensation he knows rubio isn t all that great a talent off camera but a spot on his ticket is presumably one option we re in the process now of looking at a number of different options cruz said wednesday during a cnn town hall i consider marco a friend he added saying anyone anyone would naturally look at marco as a potential running mate then there s john kasich who achieves the rare feat of actually angering cruz for real the cruz campaign believes that kasich s votes come right out of cruz s haul not trump s making him nothing but a spoiler overtures seem to be going poorly as cruz would see it kasich wants to be paid to go away and cruz resents the blackmail enough so that even cool calculation won t bring him to the table right now he much prefers to shut out kasich entirely which makes rubio s delegates all the more crucial if you need your car washed these days tell cruz you re a rubio delegate of course cruz is all too aware that kasich has something to offer trump instead already the trump and kasich camps are quietly collaborating most recently in michigan where they teamed up to ensure that convention committee assignments didn t go to cruz supporters by staying in the campaign kasich is potentially widening the gap between trump and cruz making cruz less and less credible as an alternative in cleveland he is also amassing delegates who might if so directed by kasich agree to switch their vote to trump this favor could earn kasich a place on trump s ticket something kasich currently rules out but might consider if presented with the offer and if the convention delegates agree to it never underestimate the temptation of a slot on a presidential campaign ticket even one headed by donald trump by the way have you noticed the blistering rhetoric trump and kasich have been directing at each other no neither has ted cruz funny that so cruz is sleeping only lightly these days if he pulls off his grandest scheme to pull close to even by cleveland it will be by a whisker he ll have to win big in the coming states apart from new york which he knows is lost and enter july with momentum of course if trump arrives with just a few dozen votes under the magic number of 1 237 then cruz s chances are poor there are already 112 unbound delegates on the first vote and as noah millman of the american conservative points out a fair proportion of them might be cruz haters who prefer to throw their support to trump in the first round even if trump s shortfall is larger over 100 votes shy of the nomination thwarting trump would still require a flood of delegates to defect to cruz it s possible but the motivation would be a combination of trump hatred and cruz adoration cruz might prefer to be loved but he s not insisting on it again he s a realistic man will be used in accordance with our
