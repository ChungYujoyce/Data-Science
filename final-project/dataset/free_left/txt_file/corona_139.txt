missouri s governor has started to lift restrictions but on liberty s main street most shops and restaurants were shut chris mcgreal in liberty missouri wed 6 may 2020 11 00bst last modified on wed 6 may 2020 20 50bst they were not exactly rushing to embrace their new found freedom in liberty missouri even as the state endured its largest increase in coronavirus cases on monday missouri s republican governor mike parson decided to press ahead with his plan to allow businesses to reopen and to lift restrictions on social gatherings imposed as the pandemic crept closer six weeks ago but for all the fury of gun toting protests against lockdowns and stay at home orders in some parts of america only a smattering of liberty s shops and restaurants opened their doors while many people were pleased to see the restrictions eased some also harbored doubts about whether it might lead to a resurgence of covid 19 with missouri recording more than 8 700 confirmed cases and a total of 358 deaths by monday and projections that 3 000 people a day could be dying across the us in a month a short line formed outside brendle s barber shop where the owner had refused offers of large payments to cut hair during the closure you wouldn t believe what people offered me for haircuts fifty dollars from one man i got a guy a regular customer who was super pissed at me because i wouldn t open up to give him a cut said tara brendle brendle said she was nervous about reopening but decided to do so with precautions including obliging customers to wait outside the door and sanitizing everything from chairs to gowns between them i m not as worried about myself as i am about other people like my parents and kids she said but i needed to go back to business luckily i don t have a ton of overheads i had savings i dipped into i wouldn t have survived without it but i couldn t go on much longer lyle hoover waiting outside for his first haircut since the lockdown thought it was about time as this thing barrels on i can t help but think we re being manipulated not to take anything from the seriousness of coronavirus but i think it s being blown way out of proportion there s a good percentage of this country who live paycheck to paycheck and now their livelihood has been taken away he said parson lifted the closures as part of what he calls his show me strong recovery plan which relies heavily on testing for the virus and access to protective equipment both of which remain limited brendle doesn t have a lot of confidence that parson or the state government know what they are doing not least because they have done little to help her over the past six weeks there s no organization there s no real plan just open up and we ll see what happens she said we all know there s going to be a resurgence in cases but if they don t know what to do i sure as hell don t confidence in the governor was not enhanced when parson decided to mark the reopening by touring an electrical contractor and a hunting and fishing store without wearing a face mask in a pointed rejection of federal health recommendations i chose not to he said i don t think that it is government s role to mandate who wears one the sense that parson s coronavirus policy is driven less by health priorities than political and business ones was strengthened when he told workers they would have to return to their jobs if their employers demand it or lose benefits when we open the state up if you ve got to go back to work if your boss calls and says you have to go back to work you have to go back to work he said last week you can t have a good economy when you don t have customers when you don t have workers pushback has come from the mayors of missouri s two biggest cities st louis and kansas city which have kept restrictions in place including the closure of restaurants for sit down dining gyms and non essential shops when restaurants reopen in the middle of the month kansas city s mayor quinton lucas plans to limit seating to just 10 capacity or 10 people including employees you can t have a good economy when you don t have customers when you don t have workers he said hammerhand coffee on a corner of liberty s main square has been open throughout for takeaway drinks the cafe was free to open its doors to customers on monday morning but decided against it we re adhering to the county guidelines which is 25 capacity which allows us six people including staff which didn t make sense said lucas bell from behind a plastic screen bell wasn t at all sure reopening business completely was right in any case i agree with the closure i respect the kansas city mayor more than the governor the mayor s more cautious i don t know if the governor knows what he s talking about he said that uncertainty is reflected around the square where most businesses remained firmly closed the florists boutiques and jewelers were all still shut hueys on the square restaurant which gave away free boxed meals to families in need was open with some tables marked no seating to keep patrons six feet apart but there was not a customer in sight
