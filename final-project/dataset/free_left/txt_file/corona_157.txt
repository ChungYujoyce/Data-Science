friday affecting three of america s largest cities los angeles new york and philadelphia others have already begun alcocer an organizer with the group union de vecinos which organized a rent strike in east los angeles this month said the larger los angeles tenants union is planning a citywide rent strike she predicted that its roughly 8 000 union members will forgo rent this month the tenants union had 3 000 members before the crisis by march it grew by a thousand and in mid april it doubled to 8 000 she said the growth is a testament to the uncertain times people are looking for something to

sticking it to landlords they are also advocating for a relief fund for apartment owners too what weaver hopes to see she said is unprecedented government intervention in the housing market because of the economic effects of the pandemic and she wants this to be the chance to make the market more equitable we re in a moment where politically impossible things are possible and a rent strike is not just about canceling rent for the crisis she said citing the pace at which congress moved to pass the massive 2 trillion relief package and other pandemic related aid it s about like opening up a whole new world of social housing she added we don t go back to go back to a world with 92 000 homeless new yorkers and half our state can t afford to pay their rent bob pinnegar ceo of the national apartment association which has 81 000 members nationwide said that april was a good month for apartment owners and that many saw tenants use credits cards to pay rent in advance of expected stimulus money but for may he said there s uncertainty he said the rent strike is counterproductive and would put more stress on the economy there s definitely growing concerns he said everyone anticipates that there s going to be distress and it s going to be more pronounced than april doug bibby president of the national multifamily housing council which represents the apartment industry called the strike reckless because of the ripple effects on the housing market more than 43 million households are renters according to the organization and a wide enough strike could be devastating he said these people don t think through who they re hurting and they re disrupting the entire financial ecosystem in doing this he said they think they re hurting the big bad landlord and what they re really hurting are all kinds of people just like themselves and they are spreading the economic malaise more broadly in the economy he said instead that there should be a more directed focus on pressing local and federal lawmakers to intervene he said his group for instance has been pushing for a sweeping bill promoted by rep maxine waters d calif which would provide 100 billion in direct relief to renters as well as assistance for landlords and those experiencing homelessness housing advocates fear mass evictions without government intervention more than 30 states have moratoriums on evictions during the outbreak but some will expire in the next month other states like colorado have no such mandate which has left evictions to courts and local governments creating a patchwork of policies and ever changing guidance in new york city the american center of the pandemic mayor bill de blasio a democrat has called for a rent freeze and a halt to evictions gov andrew cuomo who is also a democrat has signaled no willingness to cancel or freeze rents in california gov gavin newsom a democrat barred evictions through the end of may tenants must notify landlords within seven days of failing to

we re seeing that that was possible during this crisis alcocer said if banks are getting bailed out and corporations are getting bailed out why aren t poor people getting bailed out through this process as well she said some of the members of her organization didn t get stimulus checks from the cares act because of their immigration status or have been unable to access unemployment benefits and others are having to choose to potentially expose themselves to the virus by continuing to work new york state sen michael gianaris a democrat introduced legislation calling for rent forgiveness as well as financial relief for landlords first and foremost we need to protect renters and tenants that are in desperate straits right now and from that point forward landlords who rely on that rent to pay their bills should be next up the ladder he said in a news release announcing the bill the legislation calls for 90 days of rent forgiveness for residential and commercial tenants if they lost their work or businesses because of the pandemic as well as a 90 day suspension of some mortgage payments if the federal government showed up with some magic pot that paid people s rent for them that would solve the problem across the board he said i m not prepared to wait and hope that happens because in the meantime people are already suffering dartunorro clark is a political reporter for nbc
