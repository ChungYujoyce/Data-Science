advertisement supported by accusations of improperly using government resources have trailed the secretary of state but president trump s move to fire the state department inspector general has handed democrats a new weapon by edward wong washington secretary of state mike pompeo swatted away questions about his use of government resources again and again last year in january news reports cited unnamed diplomats complaining about his wife susan traveling with him across the middle east during a partial government shutdown in the summer members of congress began examining a whistle blower complaint accusing mr pompeo of asking diplomatic security agents to run errands like picking up restaurant takeout meals and retrieving the family dog sherman from a groomer and in october a democratic senator called for a special counsel to investigate his use of state department aircraft and funds for frequent visits to kansas where he was reported to be considering a senate run in each case mr pompeo or other department officials denied wrongdoing and the secretary moved on unscathed but his record is now coming under fresh scrutiny after president trump told congress on friday night that he was firing the state department inspector general at mr pompeo s private urging a white house official said the inspector general steve a linick who leads hundreds of employees in investigating fraud and waste at the state department had begun an inquiry into mr pompeo s possible misuse of a political appointee to perform personal tasks for him and his wife according to democratic aides that included walking the dog picking up dry cleaning and making restaurant reservations one said an echo of the whistle blower complaint from last year the details of mr linick s investigation are not clear and it may be unrelated to the previous allegations but democrats and other critics of mr pompeo say the cloud of accusations shows a pattern of abuse of taxpayer money one that may mean lawmakers will be less willing to give the administration the benefit of the doubt as congressional democrats begin an investigation into mr linick s dismissal the investigation is aimed at determining whether the act was one of illegal retaliation intended to shield mr pompeo from accountability which would undermine the foundation of our democratic institutions representative eliot l engel of new york and senator bob menendez of new jersey leading democrats on foreign policy committees said in a joint statement mr engel stressed on sunday that mr pompeo must turn over all requested records and said what i ve learned about inspector general stephen linick s removal is deeply troubling mr linick is the fourth inspector general to fall in a purge this spring by mr trump of officials he has deemed insufficiently loyal but the dismissal is the first to prompt a formal inquiry in congress and it has also drawn criticism from a few republicans the president has the right to fire any federal employee speaker nancy pelosi said on cbs s face the nation on sunday but the fact is if it looks like it is in retaliation for something that the i g the inspector general is doing that could be unlawful she called the move unsavory when you take out someone who is there to stop waste fraud abuse or other violations of the law that they believe to be happening aides to mr pompeo did not reply to repeated requests for comment the white house did not respond to questions about whether it knew of mr linick s investigation into mr pompeo when it moved to dismiss him mr linick s office has not commented on that inquiry or on mr trump s announcement which started a 30 day clock on the inspector general s departure employees under mr linick generally view him as competent and nonpartisan mr linick began his current job in 2013 and he held senior posts in the justice department starting in the administration of president george w bush in may 2016 mr linick issued a report sharply criticizing hillary clinton the former secretary of state for her use of a private email server and last fall he played a minor role during the impeachment hearings against mr trump a few republican senators notably mitt romney and charles e grassley have expressed varying degrees of disapproval of mr trump s move but on sunday senator ron johnson republican of wisconsin said i understand it i don t disagree with it he told cnn that he had spoken with white house and state department officials about the matter i m not crying big crocodile tears over this termination let s put it that way he said since mr pompeo took up his current post in april 2018 and for more than one year before that as the c i a director he has been peerless in his navigation of mr trump s inner world of loyal advisers and domestic politics around foreign policy while sticking close to mr trump he has weathered the impeachment process involving ukraine questions over the decision to kill a top iranian general and the fraught diplomacy between the president and kim jong un the unpredictable leader of north korea but the maelstrom of questions that began over the weekend could present a formidable challenge to mr pompeo s political instincts and career ambitions people close to him say he is thinking of running for president in 2024 and more immediately the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell republican of kentucky has repeatedly urged him to run for an open senate seat in kansas an important race given that the republicans are at risk of losing control of the senate in the november elections mr pompeo knows the potential effect of a congressional investigation on a politician s career as a republican congressman he helped lead the charge against mrs clinton then the secretary of state over the deaths of four americans at a mission in benghazi libya an issue that hounded her during the 2016 presidential campaign for mr pompeo the spotlight now falls on much more personal matters including the role of his wife other secretaries of state have occasionally traveled with spouses but some officials in the state department say mrs pompeo a former bank executive has played an unusually active role in running meetings and accompanying her husband on official business she has this quasi official role where my friends are called to meetings she is leading at the department said brett bruen a former career diplomat and director of global engagement on president barack obama s national security council they know that s not supposed to happen because she isn t in their chain of command but what can they do mrs pompeo has accompanied mr pompeo on several long trips overseas in january 2019 she went with him on an eight day journey across the middle east which raised questions among some officials because most state department employees including those supporting the trip were working without pay during a partial government shutdown mrs pompeo has also flown with her husband on multinight trips to switzerland and italy which included a visit to the secretary s ancestral home region of abruzzo mrs pompeo who is not paid by the state department has met with embassy families and local figures on some of the trips and mr pompeo has called her a force multiplier mrs pompeo also played an unusually prominent volunteer role at the c i a when mr pompeo was the director there she traveled with her husband used an office space in c i a headquarters and asked employees to assist her actions that an agency spokesman defended at the time their son used a c i a shooting range recreationally according to cnn mr pompeo s frequent trips to kansas last year also drew intense scrutiny he went four times three on the auspices of official business and flying in and out on state department aircraft to many the trips appeared to be part of a shadow senate campaign for 2020 and had little to do with foreign policy despite mr pompeo s denials and his refusal so far to agree to run for the seat on the last trip in october mr pompeo took part in a student event with ivanka trump mr trump s daughter and he discussed the senate race with charles koch the billionaire who is a longtime supporter of mr pompeo and dave robertson the president and chief operating officer of koch industries the wall street journal reported the kansas city star ran a blistering editorial denouncing mr pompeo s frequent trips to his adopted home state telling him he should quit and run for senate or by all means focus on u s diplomacy remember diplomacy and stop hanging out here every chance he gets four days later mr menendez the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee sent a letter to the u s office of special counsel asking it to investigate mr pompeo for potential violations of the hatch act which bars federal employees from using their official positions to engage in partisan political activities separately democratic lawmakers on a house committee last year began looking at a whistle blower complaint that mr pompeo his wife and adult son were asking diplomatic security agents to run personal errands including picking up chinese food and the family dog from a groomer the whistle blower said agents had complained they were ubereats with guns according to cnn which first reported on the accusations lon fairchild the agent in charge of the diplomatic security service told cnn that he had seen no wrongdoing the democratic lawmakers did not open a formal inquiry more broadly mr pompeo has wrestled with managing the state department though he was initially hailed by many employees as a welcome change from rex w tillerson mr trump s first secretary of state who was perceived as aloof and dismissive last fall current and former state department officials criticized mr pompeo for not vocally defending diplomats who were testifying in the impeachment inquiry and coming under attack from mr trump and for his own role in the earlier ouster of marie l yovanovitch a respected career diplomat from the ambassadorship to ukraine since the winter mr pompeo has also found himself on unsteady ground on policy amid the coronavirus pandemic usually outspoken on policy matters he seemed to play a more subdued role early in the crisis then he chose to pull back from diplomacy with china where the outbreak began and relentlessly criticized the chinese communist party for its actions he pushed spy agencies to look for evidence to support an unsubstantiated theory that the outbreak began in a virology laboratory in the city of wuhan and later said there was enormous and significant evidence behind the theory even when many scientists and intelligence analysts argued otherwise on sunday mr pompeo warned china in a statement that he was aware the chinese government has threatened to interfere with the work of american journalists in hong kong which has semi autonomy he did not give details but said that these journalists are members of a free press not propaganda cadres and their valuable reporting informs chinese citizens and the world david e sanger
