advertisement supported by by michael m grynbaum the uniquely uncivil presidential campaign is about to produce one of the biggest civic gatherings in decades for 90 minutes on monday night a polarized nation will pause to watch the first head to head encounter between hillary clinton and donald j trump the total audience network executives and political strategists say could be as high as 100 million viewers super bowl territory that would surpass the 80 million who watched jimmy carter and ronald reagan in 1980 the record for a presidential debate and rank among television benchmarks like the finales of mash and cheers not all viewers will watch from their living rooms at the dreamland theater in tiny nantucket mass so many are expected for a debate watching party that the town assigned a police officer to stand watch in case of rowdiness in paris many of those abroad for fashion week are setting middle of the night alarms so they can watch the debate live at 3 a m local time i need to feel like i m part of this said laura brown instyle s editor in chief and in richardson tex the alamo drafthouse had to switch to a bigger room after overwhelming interest in a screening with refreshments like a build a wall around it taco salad mass experiences built around news events like the moon landing and pop culture moments for older generations like the who shot j r episode of dallas are rare in an age of fragmented media and the drift toward partisan outlets where viewers can effectively choose their own news but tight polls and curiosity about the unconventional mr trump are luring viewers in a new york times cbs news poll this month 83 percent of registered voters said they were very or somewhat likely to watch on monday it s a throwback to a phenomenon that has essentially disappeared in the era of digital media said andrew heyward a former president of cbs news this is americans gathering around the electronic hearth advertisers including audi cars and tecate beer are taking advantage introducing debate themed commercials in the kind of tie in marketing usually reserved for events like the super bowl although the debate will air without commercials cable and broadcast channels have sold millions of dollars worth of ads for programming before and afterward television networks and online streaming sites including facebook and twitter will carry the same feed on monday showing a spare debate stage at hofstra university on long island a format that predates the blaring graphics and space age sets that now dominate television news still even if a large portion of the country is watching what americans see may be as much about their beliefs and preferred news outlets as what transpires onstage about 8 percent of registered voters remain undecided according to the new york times cbs news poll a thin if crucial sliver of the electorate and after mrs clinton and mr trump conclude on monday viewers are likely to return to their ideological silos absorbing instant analysis from left leaning anchors on msnbc or commentators at right leaning outlets like breitbart news the debate itself will be subject to instant blow by blow interpretation on social media regardless of where you re watching whether it s facebook live or nbc or fox news there will be a moment where we all witness it said charles l ponce de leon author of that s the way it is a history of television news but that moment will quickly crumble when all the instant analysis and opining comes into play the event s impact is unlikely to rival that of say 1960 when john f kennedy s smooth performance in the first televised debate helped sway voters against his opponent richard nixon that debate aired without commentary or graphics and captions on the screen journalists were of the opinion they should wait and ruminate and think about what went down and then a day or a week later talk about it mr de leon said mr trump has unleashed a blizzard of falsehoods exaggerations and outright lies in the general election here s our analysis of 31 untruths from sept 15 21 tom sander who runs a program on civic engagement at the harvard kennedy school of government said he was worried that voters might not have a chance to remove partisan blinders many of us come to these events more to confirm what we already think we know rather than to search for common ground mr sander said the candidates may hope otherwise mrs clinton has told donors privately that she expects 100 million people to watch the debate and that 60 million of those viewers may be focusing on the campaign for the first time a prime opportunity for her to make inroads many may tune in merely for the spectacle it s like waiting for the ali frazier fight said dick cavett the longtime talk show host referring to the highly anticipated boxing bouts between muhammad ali and joe frazier in the 1970s mr cavett said he would cut short a dinner on monday to ensure he would be in front of a tv by 9 p m there s possible drama and fireworks and insults and horror and disaster and potential enlightenment mr cavett said it would attract anybody 15

interest may be less of a draw than seeing a colorful candidate like ms palin or mr trump the 1980 carter reagan debate scored a record audience in part because it was the only head to head matchup between the candidates in a precable era but neal shapiro a former president of nbc news recalled that mr reagan s unusual background as a hollywood actor spurred interest people wanted to see would they really feel comfortable with reagan as president mr shapiro said people were wondering can i live with this guy the first debate between president obama and mitt romney in 2012 drew 67 million

features a view of the mexican border and a trump like voice over that declares the time has come for a wall a tremendous wall the wall is revealed as a knee high resting place for tecate beers a wall that brings us together the ad airing on networks including fox news and univision is absolutely not about a political point of view or affiliation said felix palau a vice president at tecate tecate being a mexican beer is a perfect protagonist of a story where a wall brings people together in a very fun way mr palau said the debate s biggest televised competition on monday is likely to be another program featuring intricate strategies and crushing blows monday night football on espn and one famous political junkie says he may flip the channel for a few minutes at least to the action on the gridiron the president s fired up about monday night football josh earnest the white house press secretary playfully told reporters who asked if president obama planned to watch the debate there
