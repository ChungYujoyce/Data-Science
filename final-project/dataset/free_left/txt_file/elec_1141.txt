 2016 sensing weakness republicans are aggressively contesting the early state where paul was thought to have an advantage by elena schneider 08 16 2015 08 32 am edt gardnerville nev at the outset of the campaign nevada was thought to be rand paul s western firewall a state uniquely suited to the kentucky senator s self described libertarianish message between the remnants of his father s political organization and a caucus system that rewards passion and grassroots energy it figured to be as good a place as any for paul to plant his flag and pull out an early state win but things haven t gone according to plan for paul and nowhere is that more obvious than in nevada advertisement sensing an opportunity his rivals have geared up to compete by hiring top notch state talent and making regular stops and at a sold out gathering here of 1 500 conservatives saturday the first ever basque fry hosted by state attorney general adam laxalt it was ted cruz who stole the show paul was notably absent scheduled instead for a medical mission to haiti at an event heavy with the state s political class there were few signs that paul was missed one reason is that there are still lingering tensions over bitter disputes between supporters of paul s father former gop rep ron paul and the state republican establishment but there s also a simpler explanation one that has little to do with paul or his father the gop field is so big this time around that unlike in 2012 those animated by anti establishment and anti washington fervor have plenty of viable options to choose from i don t know anybody who s going to vote for him said mary burgoon a board member of the nevada federation of republican women in carson city there are a few diehards but that s it why him when we ve got so many others anyway that feeling was prevalent among attendees of the basque fry which drew four presidential candidates to a ranch an hour south of reno and hundreds of miles north of the state s population center of las vegas they reveled in their 2016 options and especially in the candidates who delivered speeches saturday former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina and dr ben carson neither of whom has ever held elected office wisconsin gov scott walker and conservative firebrand texas sen ted cruz who railed against washington and squishy conservatives paul is in the shadow of his father said adam khan a 24 year old chairman of reno s washoe county republican party rand paul was the anti establishment guy because he was his dad s son but that pool is now flooded he s going to have to do something else besides giving a diluted version of his dad s policies he needs to differentiate himself michael kruse where nevada was once a feverous stronghold for paul s father whose supporters ran an aggressive ground game that suspended the caucus in 2008 and overran the delegate selection process in 2012 this year the pauls are no longer a lone voice in the wilderness said jericha deaux political director for the clark county republican party i ve seen a huge off shot of rand supporters who have left him for donald trump rand paul s concessions to mainstream politics a distinct departure from the uncompromising style that ultimately relegated his father to the sidelines of national politics have also cost him some support though how much remains unclear he s lost some of his father s people and in my view cruz and walker are taking them away from him said ray rocha president of the republican men s club of northern nevada paul s campaign which is still coming together is not concerned said richard bunce an activist who along with his brother carl coordinated rep ron paul s nevada operation in previous cycles and are repeating similar roles he pulls in standing room only crowds in nevada so he s a headliner person bunce said he isn t going to be a part of the machine which is what the event was and so that was not his crowd but the mere fact that paul s effort is still taking shape in a state that was expected to be a stronghold is itself revealing and his rivals have taken notice several other presidential campaigns have already brought on staff lined up key endorsements and started to build out field operations walker signaled his intentions by going to las vegas the day after he announced his presidential bid in wisconsin while cruz has picked up the same consultants who helped deliver laxalt s tight 2014 win jeb bush who spoke at a town hall rally in north las vegas on wednesday can point to endorsements from gop sen dean heller rep mark amodei who spoke at the basque fry on saturday and former lt gov brian krolicki he s also hired ryan erwin considered one of the state s top gop operatives sen marco rubio enlisted lt gov mark hutchison to serve as his state director in may hutchison a member of the church of the latter day saints has helped rubio make a serious play for the mormon voting bloc in a state with a relatively high mormon population politico staff paul understands our base he understands how to get us going but at the end of the day he has no team said joe tuzzolino northern nevada director for the rubio campaign he hasn t put much together and he s asking people to work for free not actually investing in them as individuals bunce insists the paul campaign is simply holding to its bottom up playbook a strategy that doesn t require high priced talent we re a grassroots organization so we don t require paul to come and buy his team he said the paul team chalked up a victory in june when the state legislature failed to pass a bill that would have switched nevada from a caucus system which is more favorably inclined to well organized minority factions like ron paul s supporters in 2008 and 2012 to a primary and even though some nevadans said this weekend they had ruled out paul many recognize it s a long road to february there s plenty of time for change around here said nick phillips former political director for the clark county gop but it could be interesting if people don t pay attention missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest
