agra was touted as a model in fight against covid 19 in early april but more than 600 cases emerged in recent weeks on february 25 a day after us president donald trump and his wife melania posed for pictures outside the taj mahal on an official visit to india sumit kapoor returned to his nearby home from a trip to italy kapoor a partner in a shoe manufacturing firm tested positive a week later for the new coronavirus becoming the first confirmed case in the north indian city of agra and the origin of the country s first big cluster of the virus the city of 1 6 million people famous for its

iconic taj mahal a unesco world heritage site was closed to visitors as part of measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic by early april the city thought it had the virus beat containing cases to under 50 while new infections exploded in other indian cities prime minister narendra modi s government lauded the agra model as a template for the country s battle against covid 19 the disease caused by the coronavirus now as the city and its hospitals battle a second wave of infections agra is a model of a different kind illustrating how the coronavirus can roar back even after a swift lockdown and elaborate containment measures if it hadn t spread in the hospitals we would have been able to contain it said agra s top local official district magistrate prabhu n singh as india grapples with about 42 000 coronavirus infections second only to china in asia agra s tangle with the virus offers lessons for big cities in india and elsewhere it all began with a shoemaker who visited a trade fair in italy after flying home via austria kapoor 44 who lives about 10km 6 2 miles from the taj mahal first learned he might be infected on march 1 when his brother in law who travelled with him came down with a fever and tested positive in new delhi a state official called kapoor the next day and told him to get tested at the agra district hospital he was positive and so were his father mother son wife and brother all six were moved to a hospital in new delhi about 200km 124 miles to the north my brother and i had a sore throat and the other four didn t have any symptoms kapoor told reuters news agency later kapoor s accountant in agra and his wife also tested positive for covid 19 while other unrelated cases started showing up around the city singh the district magistrate and his team attempted to establish containment zones as the virus spread across the city but they ran into a problem how to quickly screen thousands of households dr brajendra singh chandel a surveillance medical officer with the world health organization who in agra said he pulled out vaccination microplans that had been developed for polio control by the who using them alongside google maps to plot target areas the detailed household level plans which helped india eradicate polio in 2014 have clearly demarcated start middle and end points for surveying an area chandel explained allowing teams to work their way through any neighbourhood efficiently once we zeroed down on the area we used the polio microplans to execute he said local authorities identified an epicentre for each cluster of infections and drew three kilometre 1 9 mile wide containment zones around them they surveyed residents in those areas looking for those who had contact with people who tested positive for the coronavirus or who were showing symptoms nearly 3 000 workers screened some 165 000 households according to a government presentation meanwhile epidemiologists from the federal government s india epidemic intelligence service arrived in agra to help with containment contact tracing and analysing data said dr anshul pareek who leads the city s coronavirus rapid response team as the number of cases grew authorities sealed off infection hotspots typically groups of houses or parts of a street and cordoned off adjoining neighbourhoods holding as many as 10 000 people in a control room used to manage traffic officials monitored camera feeds from across the city to ensure the lockdown was enforced thousands of police were deployed to hotspots and checkpoints loudspeakers blared messages telling residents to stay indoors that differed from other indian cities many of which failed to isolate patients or track down their contacts allowing the infection to spread according to health authorities weak lockdowns allowed potential carriers to slip through containment cordons they added more than 1 300 people have died from the virus in india agra was celebrated for appearing to have contained the virus on april 11 lav agarwal a senior official in india s federal health ministry held up agra as an example of how india was working to defeat the pandemic but a resurgence was already in the works in late march a gathering of the islamic missionary group tablighi jamaat in new delhi had become a source for hundreds of new infections nationwide federal authorities sent officials in agra a list of attendees to track down singh said agarwal did not respond to requests for comment by reuters district police chief babloo kumar said he used police investigation tactics and cellphone data to identify tablighi jamaat members and their contacts eventually 104 people from this group tested positive in agra the effort was helped by the nationwide lockdown on march 25 that stopped all public transport shut businesses and kept residents at home without a lockdown we could not have done anything singh said by early april a patient linked to the tablighi group showed up at an agra hospital and later tested positive for covid 19 officials said the disease spread rapidly among patients and staff who went on to infect their families and relatives new cases also popped up in agra s other healthcare facilities worst hit was paras hospital the source of at least 92 coronavirus cases singh said one staff member infected 14 others in a two room home he said in another case a patient from the hospital infected 32 others in a nearby town he added the hospital was sealed off on april 6 late last month a chart tracking contacts of positive patients linked to the facility still stood next to singh s desk agra now has about 600 coronavirus cases and 14 deaths according to local authorities as of the end of april there were 39 infection hotspots and tests had been conducted on 6 848 samples with some people tested multiple times singh said he is confident the city will defeat the virus thanks in part to its aggressive contact tracing system the good part is that for all the cases we know the source he said still eradicating covid 19 in agra s crowded neighbourhoods will remain difficult particularly without testing large groups of people said dr rajib dasgupta an epidemiologist who teaches at new delhi s jawaharlal nehru university even within a containment zone for some conceivable time it s not going to go away very rapidly said dasgupta
