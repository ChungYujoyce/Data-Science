anderson cooper profiles the artist who tackles complex social and political issues through abstract works mark bradford is widely considered one of the most important and influential artists in america today his abstract canvases which often deal with complex social and political issues hang in major museums around the world and on the walls of big collectors and some small ones like me bradford s art may look like paintings but there s hardly any paint on them they re made out of layers and layers of paper which he tears glues power washes and sands in a style all his own when he began making art in his 30s bradford couldn t afford expensive paint so he started experimenting with endpapers that are used for styling hair he got the idea while working as a hair stylist in his mom s beauty shop in south los angeles he was broke struggling and didn t sell his first painting until he was nearly 40 anderson cooper i heard a story that when you sold your first artwork in 2001 you called up your mom do you remember what you said to her mark bradford i said girl i think i found a way out of the beauty shop laughter girl i think i found a way outta the beauty shop yeah yeah because i had no idea how i was gonna stop being a hairstylist because that s really the only thing that i knew i didn t have a problem with being a hairstylist but it s all i knew anderson cooper it s incredible to think that 2001 is when you first sold a work and now mark bradford i still sell works anderson cooper yeah you sure do laugh mark bradford i sure do his first painting sold for 5 000 now they can sell for more than 10 million this new one was bought by the broad museum in los angeles they have nine other bradford s in their collection it s called deep blue it s 12 feet high 50 feet long and took a full day to install none of those colors you see are paint it s all paper layered on canvas it s abstract but not entirely see those lines that form a grid it s a street map of the watts neighborhood in los angeles the colored balls show where properties were damaged in 1965 after six days of violent civil unrest protests over police brutality and racial inequality we first saw the painting nearly a year ago when bradford had just started working on it in his studio in south los angeles he d already made the map of watts out of bathroom caulking the following month when we stopped by again he d laid down fourteen layers of colored paper and covered it all up with a layer of black anderson cooper so there s a map underneath here mark bradford yes anderson cooper of watts mark bradford uh huh affirm all these little points are what was looted what was destroyed so i kinda start from a map and then on top of it i think i lay art history and my imagination all three bradford uses household tools to make his paintings he likes to buy everything at home depot mark bradford my motto was if home depot didn t have it mark bradford didn t use it and anderson cooper laugh that s that s your that s your motto mark bradford that s my motto that was my motto anderson cooper to this day is that mark bradford to this to this day building up the layers of paper on the canvas is just the beginning of his process he then starts to peel cut and sand them down which can take months anderson cooper it s like an archeological dig mark bradford it is like an archeological dig it s like history i m creating my own archaeological or psychiol psychological digs sometimes when i m digging on my own painting i m asking myself well exactly what are you digging for where do you want to go child anderson cooper a lot of people look at a abstract painting and think it s squiggles it s torn paper i don t understand it mark bradford yeah that s true but for me those squiggles and torn paper gives me a space to kind of unpack things like the watts riots i m grappling with how i feel about that subject and that material i do grapple with things i gr grapple with things personally and you know racially and politically what does it mean to be me mark bradford has been grappling with that question in his art for the last 18 years from making paintings out of street posters like those offering predatory loans in low income neighborhoods to creating works that address hiv aids racism and the complexity of american history he s 57 years old now and at 6 8 stands out in a crowd he still lives in south los angeles where he grew up when he was eight he says he began to get bullied by neighborhood kids mark bradford that was the first time i felt different that was the first time i was aware of my sensitivity that s the first time someone said oh you re you you you re a sissy i definitely knew that i had to learn to navigate in a more cautious way so that i could survive i just never had a problem being me anderson cooper so even though people they were calling you sissy it didn t make you want to try to change yourself mark bradford not really no not really i just didn t want to get my ass whooped he was raised by his mother janice banks who owned her own beauty salon that s where bradford would head everyday after school mark bradford i knew that i had to find a way to get across the schoolyard i knew that my mother was always going to be there once i got across the schoolyard and maybe maybe i was in the hair salon every day watchin women get across the schoolyard laughs i would hear their stories i would watch them go through and i just thought if they can do it i most certainly can do it mark bradford started working in the salon as a teenager eventually becoming a hairstylist it was a safe place where he could be himself but that feeling disappeared in 1981 when his friends began dying from aids mark bradford i knew a storm was coming i knew that in the gut i knew that and people were just dying that s what it felt like to me at 18 years old i just was thinking how are we going to make it through anderson cooper did you think you would make it through mark bradford no no i didn t think i d make it through thinking he didn t have a future he didn t plan for one but when he was nearly 30 he took art classes at a junior college and he says it clicked mark bradford it was the reading and learning about different scholars and feminism and deconstructing modernism and all i just oh man this is i m really into this i m not exactly sure what it is but i m it just yeah anderson cooper and you d still work at the hair salon mark bradford oh yeah every day anderson cooper and so you d be studying while at the hair salon mark bradford oh absolutely they i put the book in their lap and said girl read that back to me he won a scholarship to the california institute of the arts but struggled to make money as an artist when he was 39 he finally had a breakthrough mark bradford i was working on a head anderson cooper working on a head mark bradford working on a head working on a anderson cooper at the beauty salon mark bradford beauty salon yeah cause i was still working the hair salon anderson i told you that anderson cooper i just didn t know that terminology mark bradford i was hooking it up right late at night i was tired as hell too and just end papers fell on the floor and i looked down i thought oh they re translucent oh oh i could use these endpapers are small rectangular tissues used to make permanent waves in hair bradford began burning the papers edges and lining them up into grids he glued onto bed sheets mark bradford i knew i was onto something i knew this was bridging this material came from a sight outside of the paint store i think early on i was trying to weave these two sides of who i was together the art world and the sights that i had come from the life that i had led i didn t want to leave any of it be i didn t want to edit out anything private collectors began snapping up his endpaper paintings and his career took off he is now a celebrity in the art world his gallery openings are star studded events at the latest one in los angeles beyonc and jay z who own several bradfords stopped in the 10 paintings in this exhibition sold out before the gallery doors opened bradford and his partner of more than 20 years allan dicastro are committed to using contemporary art and their own money to revitalize the neighborhood bradford grew up in in 2014 they opened art practice with eileen harris norton the first collector to buy bradford s work it s a nonprofit complex of buildings that includes a gallery lecture spaces and his mother s old beauty salon mark bradford this is the last hair salon that my mom worked in and then i took it over from her it was in the 90s it was called foxy hair they turned foxy hair into a center for young adults transitioning out of foster care but we were surprised to learn that mark bradford still styles hair he does it for some of his former clients from the beauty shop who are also among his closest friends anderson cooper when you look around does his art make sense to you cleo jackson i it does it s like a map laughter in outer space danielle wright no i mean i look at it it s beautiful

m anderson cooper you don t see it lynette powell i don t but i like how you give a little insight of like what s going on in our community i know that much about your art so that much i really like bradford s latest work continues to focus on difficult and controversial issues this painting which is prominently displayed in the los angeles county museum of art is called 150 portrait tone and was made in response to the 2016 fatal police shooting of philando castile during a traffic stop in minnesota diamond reynolds in livestream of shooting he was trying to get out his id in his wallet out his um pocket and he let the officer know castile s girlfriend diamond reynolds livestreamed the incident bradford was so haunted by her words he made them into this painting diamond reynolds in livestream of shooting please don t tell me this lord please jesus don t tell me that he s gone anderson cooper it s really the conversation that his girlfriend is having mark bradford with multiple people which i was fascinated by anderson cooper why were you fascinated by it mark bradford how composed she was she was having a conversation with her daughter in the backseat with philando who was passing away with god with us facebook and with the policeman all simultaneously it was visual and textual and heartbreaking and heroic and strong all at the same time in another major new work bradford turned his gaze to the civil war it s called pickett s charge and it s a reimagining of a pivotal union victory at the battle of gettysburg it was commissioned by the smithsonian s hirshhorn museum in washington d c bradford used as his starting point blown up photos of a 19th century panoramic painting of pickett s charge a painting which offers a romanticized view of the confederacy he then added layers of paper and cords over it then carefully gouged shredded and ripped it apart mark bradford they almost feel like lacerations anderson cooper uh huh affirm mark bradford almost scaring anderson cooper uh huh affirm mark bradford that s what those feel like and a little bit like bullet wounds like you re really anderson cooper uh huh affirm yeah mark bradford punctures it s a 360 degree painting that raises many questions in bradford s mind particularly about how we look at history anderson cooper it s looking at it through a different lens mark bradford yes that s the feeling that i wanted you to have that history was laying on top of it that that gouging into it erasing it bits of it showing it s kind of me kind of revising it in a way anderson cooper so is this a more accurate representation of history mark bradford i don t really believe history s ever fully accurate anderson cooper it s acknowledging that mark bradford it s acknowledging the gaps the things we don t know so many people have come to see pickett s charge the hirshhorn has extended the exhibition for three more years bradford is already working on new paintings for shows in china london and new york anderson cooper do you worry about the vagaries of the art world what is popular today 20 years from now mark bradford oh no no no no i wouldn t have no i have never anderson cooper i mean art has value because people believe it has value mark bradford i no i think art has value because it has value i m not gonna wait for somebody else to tell me my work has value i certainly wasn t gonna wait on people to tell me i had value i d probably still be waiting i just it has value cause i think it has value and then if other people get on the value you know mark bradford value train
