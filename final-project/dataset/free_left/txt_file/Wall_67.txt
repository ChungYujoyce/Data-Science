advertisement supported by his books broke new ground in political science emphasizing politicians interactions not in washington but in their home districts by neil genzlinger richard f fenno jr a scholar whose close range studies of how congress and other parts of government actually work broke new ground in political science by focusing less on government processes and more on how the people s representatives interact with their constituents back home died on april 21 in rye n y he was 93 his son craig said the cause was presumed to be the coronavirus though his father who was in a nursing home at his death had not been tested professor fenno who taught at the university of rochester in upstate new york for 46 years wrote 19 books most focusing on the house or senate some including the making of a senator dan quayle 1989 and learning to legislate the senate education of arlen specter 1991 were about individual members others dealt with broader subjects there was for instance going home black representatives and their constituents 2003 representation he wrote in that book is at bottom a home relationship one that begins in the constituency and ends there thus he visited the representatives he wrote about not just in washington but also in their districts home not washington is the place where most house member constituent contact occurs he wrote and the place where judgment is ultimately rendered professor fenno who joined the university of rochester faculty in 1957 and retired in 2003 called his research method soaking and poking soaking up information and poking into details it was a brand of scholarship he imparted to generations of students in 1968 an eventful year in american history one of those students robert sachs came to him with an idea that professor fenno turned into a university of rochester institution the so called washington semester in which a student receives credit for working in the political sphere in the nation s capital having heard professor fenno speak enthusiastically about shadowing members of congress and senators in the course of his research mr sachs said by email i thought maybe i could also learn this way and get involved in the world of politics at the same time mr sachs whose subsequent career included working on capitol hill and in the executive branch was the first of many to take the washington semester a relatively new idea at the time another was heather a higginbottom who became a deputy secretary of state in president barack obama s administration the washington semester program was brilliant in its simplicity she said by email fenno understood that to truly understand how policy is made the dynamics that contribute to decision making you needed to be up close and personal the experience she said stayed with her that one internship nearly 30 years ago completely informed my approach to politics and policy she said it grounded me in the pragmatism of policymaking richard francis fenno jr was born on dec 12 1926 in winchester mass his father was in the coal business his mother mary tredennick fenno died when he was a child after serving in the navy during world war ii he graduated from amherst college in 1948 he earned a ph d in political science from harvard in 1956 with a dissertation titled the president s cabinet which became his first book in 1959 this book is at once a first rate story of what makes the american political system tick making it of interest to the general reader and a perceptive study of the cabinet in recent years the boston globe wrote professor fenno s later books included home style house members in their districts 1978 in which he explored the individual styles that members of congress affected in their districts to help secure re election the book discussed what has come to be called fenno s paradox the oddity that while most people vilify congress as a whole they have good opinions of their own representatives it is easy for each congressman to explain to his supporters why he cannot be blamed for the performance of the collectivity professor fenno wrote because the internal diversity and decentralization of the institution provide such a wide variety of collegial villains to flay before one s supporters at home in congress at the grassroots representational change in the south 1970 1998 2000 he examined how two men jack flynt and mac collins represented georgia congressional districts in different eras the goal as in his other portraits was to see them as flesh and blood multidimensional individuals and not just as part of a widely condemned category of politicians professor fenno married nancy davidson in 1948 in addition to his son craig his wife survives him along with a sister elizabeth blucke and two grandchildren his older son mark died in 2017 one of his later books congressional travels places connections and authenticity 2007 came about when professor fenno was struck by the national attention and bipartisan affection accorded to a relatively anonymous house member john joseph moakley a massachusetts democrat who served for 28 years when he died in 2001 mr moakley s funeral drew 900 people the explanatory story i wish to tell professor fenno wrote begins with a reminder that a house member s designation as prescribed in the u s constitution is not congressman it is representative and whereas congressman or congresswoman tends to call our attention to a house member s capitol hill activities and to his or her relationship with colleagues representative points us toward a house member s activities in his or her home district and to relationships with constituents we could know all there was to know about moakley s life in washington and not explain the attendance at his funeral he continued i will argue that he was not a memorable congressman but he was a memorable representative advertisement
