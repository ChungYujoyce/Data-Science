texas ruralhealth care systemmay not have the budgets to survive the coronavirus pandemic 60 minutes met with a few of the people trying to make sureruralcommunities still receive care the state of texas has three of the biggest cities in america but it has not suffered the same number of covid 19 infections as other large states as of friday texas was ranked 9th but texas also ranks near the bottom when it comes to the percentage of residents it s tested and that worries some doctors and nurses especially those in rural areas of the state many small hospitals and clinics around the country are fearful they don t have the staff and budget to survive the pandemic among those trying to prop up the system in texas is sid miller the commissioner of agriculture who wears many hats he came to our interview wearing a custom made white one sid miller well i m the commissioner of agriculture course we oversee you know cows plows and sows but that s i m also the commissioner of the state office of rural health so we we re we re trying to keep 163 rural hospitals open and from you know going out of business sharyn alfonsi any sense of how many hospitals rural hospitals are at risk right now in texas sid miller well of the 163 we have 60 of em have less than 30 days cash on hand sharyn alfonsi whoa sid miller yeah some of them actually we had one filing for bankruptcy this week sharyn alfonsi a hospital sid miller in alpine texas and the parent company are filing for bankruptcy so we ve already sharyn alfonsi did this push them over the edge the covid sid miller yes it it pushed them over the edge and i m i m afraid this pandemic we re gonna we re gonna continue to lose health care providers in rural texas and across the nation low reimbursement rates and high numbers of uninsured patients have forced 128 hospitals that served 6 million people across the nation to close in the last decade twenty one hospitals were in texas more than any other state that s left one out of five rural texas counties without a doctor elizabeth ellis is a nurse practitioner when we met her she was tearing around her east texas farm with her four legged sidearm named pistol the clinic she owns is in bedias texas population 443 lately her job includes administering covid 19 tests in the clinic parking lot sharyn alfonsi has coronavirus reached out here elizabeth ellis yes it has reached grimes county sharyn alfonsi that s shocking you know driving through here i definitely saw more cows than people elizabeth ellis a lot of our community members have to leave the county for jobs that puts them at risk so it was inevitable that at some point in time it was gonna hit the county so far grimes county has reported 19 covid cases and one death the county is about an hour and a half northwest of houston 400 000 acres of it are covered with farms and ranches social distancing is built into the landscape and enforced by barbed wire sharyn alfonsi tell me what the challenge is of providing health care in a rural community like this elizabeth ellis we have larger elderly population and they have sometimes ten sometimes 12 even 20 chronic disease states and comorbid conditions they re poor predominantly on medicaid i have a tremendous agricultural group of farmers and families that are in the gap they can t afford insurance sharyn alfonsi when you say in the gap what do you mean by that elizabeth ellis they are not quite poor enough to be on medicaid and they don t make enough money to yet afford insurance sharyn alfonsi so as we re talking about coronavirus we know the elderly are at higher risk we know people with preexisting conditions are at higher risk and that s this community elizabeth ellis it is this community now many of those patients are too afraid to go to the clinic others simply can t get there elizabeth ellis for many of these people transportation is a liability they don t have it or they can t dri they re elderly they have conditions and they can t drive increasingly ellis s rounds require a full tank of gas she negotiates dusty roads to check up on patients at their homes sharyn alfonsi so if you get a bunch of coronavirus cases if there s some kind of community spread here what happens what do you do elizabeth ellis i m gonna be overwhelmed and what frightens me is that all of america s critical access hospitals especially here in texas are at risk of closing critical access hospitals are the health care outposts many rural communities rely on the drive to an emergency room can take an hour or more dr leighann falcon i take care of people i went to school with their parents i take care of former teachers they may go to the same school as my kids they may go to my gym and so we just we we know everyone dr leighann falcon is one of 10 full time doctors at memorial medical center in calhoun county it serves 26 000 people on the gulf coast of texas dr falcon also runs a clinic just down the street sharyn alfonsi you hear about rural health care in texas and it being such a dire situation here and hospitals closing and doctors leaving why why is it so bad in texas dr leighann falcon we lead the nation in a lotta things including uninsured so about 9 of people are uninsured across the country give or take and in texas it s more than double that our little hospital down the street on any given year can provide up to 6 million in uncompensated care and it s hard to run a business when you re giving away 6 million a year and this year the pandemic has pushed calhoun county s hospital further into the red like many states preparing for the pandemic texas cancelled non essential medical procedures for 30 days to expand hospital capacity around the state things like colonoscopies and lab services that usually make up half the revenue at the state s rural hospitals when we visited calhoun county s hospital there were no covid patients but few other patients either we noticed the er was silent and most beds were empty partly because fear of the virus is discouraging people from going to the er an administrator told us they were down to seven days worth of cash revenue from elective procedures a primary moneymaker for the hospital has almost disappeared sharyn alfonsi can you know the hospitals the clinics survive this dr leighann falcon without assistance they won t survive and if our hospital were to close it would devastate our community it would it would be horrible sharyn alfonsi how so dr leighann falcon well first of all there s just a lack of care again we re already short physicians we re short for health care if you have an emergency and the nearest emergency room is over 35 miles away that s not a good thing dr falcon a single mother of three has started skipping paychecks to pay her staff and there s another problem doctors and nurses must treat every patient like they may have covid 19 now they re running low on personal protective equipment dr leighann falcon it s empty sharyn alfonsi it s empty dr leighann falcon yeah and i never thought i would see that a nurse told us they are reusing masks and mixing their own cleaning supplies the number of covid 19 cases is still rising in their county last week it was up to 30 and preparing for the possibility of more is further draining the budget dr leighann falcon our hospital is financially struggling on a good day so now this normal equipment which we probably pay what a dollar for 50 cents for and now we are paying 20 times that it s just crazy sharyn alfonsi are you have prices gone up that much erin clevenger rn yeah so usually the masks like we re wearing these are like dr falcon s wearing we pay about 6 cents each normally we are paying up to 1 20 each now lately sid miller the agriculture commissioner who oversees a 680 million state budget has taken to delivering hand sanitizer in the back of his truck loading it up in austin driving it to the country sharyn alfonsi i think a lot of people think because some areas of texas are so rural and so remote that covid won t affect them won t bother them there s natural social distancing sid miller well you know that s simply not true the single hottest spot in the united states is in south dakota of all places you know had a beef packing plant up there well i think the last count i saw was like 650 cases in that one town where those you know areas of south dakota so that that that dog won t hunt it just doesn t hold true after we spoke to miller a similar hotspot surfaced nearly nine hours from austin at a meatpacking plant in a city called cactus in the texas panhandle more than 350 people have tested positive and three died in surrounding moore county which now has the highest covid infection rate in the state the sole 25 bed hospital in the county only had two ventilators the ceo of the hospital used his four seater plane to pick up two more ventilators and the state supplied another three sid miller the one thing that that s limited on these rural hospitals is ventilators some of em may have one some of em may have two we ve had to go back in and dig out those that are in storage you know and refurbish em and get them ready so we still don t quite have a handle on the ventilators in these rural hospitals in march he asked the texas governor for 40 million to prop up rural health care centers during the pandemic arguing if the hospitals fail the communities will too sid miller when a hospital closes up the manufacturing leaves too because they have to have health care you have you have to have three things you have to have a financial institution you have to have health care and you have to have church if you don t have any of those three the community starts to dry up on monday texas governor greg abbott announced he was allowing his stay at home order to expire and some texas businesses to reopen greg abbott that executive order has done its job to slow the growth of covid 19 three days later texas had its single highest number of covid deaths in a day with 50 abbott is now prioritizing testing in rural communities but he has not publicly said whether he ll grant any additional funding to rural clinics and declined our requests for an interview dr leighann falcon being younger and na ve i guess i just never realized during times like this when something would happen how much we would really have to rely on ourselves and kinda cowboy up and do things on our own in march congress approved 100 billion for hospitals and in april president trump signed a relief package that promised another 75 billion but so far the hospital in calhoun county texas has received about 600 000 of aid which they say will cover three weeks payroll and nurse practitioner elizabeth ellis has received a total of 800 on friday afternoon the trump administration promised to rush 10 billion specifically for rural health care providers nurse ellis told us she ll believe it when she sees it elizabeth ellis right now you know i m i m losin 10 000 plus sharyn alfonsi 10 000 a month elizabeth ellis yes this is my retirement i m using my retirement sharyn alfonsi no one would blame you if you said i ve had enough i can t keep diggin into my retirement why don t you elizabeth ellis because i believe in what we are doing with my heart we will do our best to maintain but it won t last for very long i m i m at risk every day right now of having to make that difficult decision produced by guy campanile and lucy hatcher field producer claire st amant
