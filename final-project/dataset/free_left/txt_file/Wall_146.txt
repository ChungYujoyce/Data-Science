opinion the pandemic makes clear there is no such thing as a chinese or african virus credit laolu senbanjo supported by by l ol senbanjo mr senbanjo is a visual artist crisis is a cruel teacher during times of crisis when people let their guard down we get to see what s really behind the facade often it s not pretty that point was made painfully clear when rather than taking the opportunity to unite and embrace a rising spirit of generosity and togetherness emanating around the globe the president of the united states made a choice to sow division publicly labeling covid 19 the chinese virus or wuhan virus for many this persistent mischaracterization has shattered any remaining hope that maybe this time we could do better but for african people like me who have witnessed the same phenomenon of attaching a disease to a nationality or ethnicity it s not a shock besides the virus itself the only novel thing is that it s now asia and not africa that has fallen victim to this malicious xenophobia african people have endured what we might call the viralization of our continent even our own bodies for decades a host of terrible maladies ebola among the most prominent have been designated as african diseases in the collective consciousness to most americans the ebola outbreak that occurred from 2014 to 2016 was likely a distant concern even as it dominated the news cycle for a few weeks and tens of thousands of people died now as the world swings into action to contain coronavirus this attitude is not less true but more so many regions are treating the pandemic with such great urgency only because powerful nations are falling victim to it yet out of this scramble a global effort must be made to change how we think about talk about and understand disease the lesson many people still need to learn is that disease is something that afflicts the human body not the chinese body the african body or the western body the moment a disease is regionalized humanity is erased in a dishonest and dangerous attempt to reduce one another to a nationality perhaps there s a deeper psychological underpinning as we try to shield ourselves mentally from anything that might harm us perhaps this is simply one of the myriad manifestations of racism which can be found in virtually every nook of human activity and interest the covid 19 outbreak is proof the virus doesn t care who you are or where you come from many have pointed out that this is an artifact of our newly globalized world i respectfully disagree the world has always been globalized as merchants traders and scholars brought one another s culture and goods into contact what s changed is that this particular pandemic has occurred at a time when we re seeing a profound shift in the way we think about the other social media allows us to see and hear first person accounts from across the globe from devastation to celebration we can no longer think about the lives and struggles of the others as independent or insulated from our own we can no longer relegate their suffering to a set of symptoms whose deeper cause is alien to the world in which we live when i began painting on people s skin it taught me something indelible about the nature of human beings my initial thinking was that the body could serve as a canvas and so it did but as my work progressed and deepened i began to see that the body of each individual expressed the painting in a different and unique way the designs which tapped deep roots of african culture came from my brush but they were given life and their unique meaning by the person who carried them when i think about the calamity the world is experiencing i think about the bodies that are afflicted by this virus and by all disease it is detrimental to the well being of everyone to pretend that a virus is african or chinese or american or french but this goes far beyond physical ailments there must be a collective understanding that social ills economic challenges and of course the looming environmental disaster belong to us all for better or worse they are a part of who we are and we are a part of them l ol senbanjo is a nigerian performance and visual artist human rights lawyer and activist based in brooklyn the times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor we d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles here are some tips and here s our email letters nytimes com follow the new york times opinion section on facebook twitter nytopinion and instagram advertisement
