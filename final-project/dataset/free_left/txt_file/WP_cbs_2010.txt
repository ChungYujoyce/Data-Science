watch cbsn live by melissa quinn april 7 2020 4 17 pm cbs news highlights from a q a with greg burel former director of the strategic national stockpile washington the coronavirus pandemic has left states from coast to coast scrambling to secure ventilators for patients and masks gloves and gowns for frontline workers as they confront a surge of patients battling covid 19 the disease caused by the coronavirus in response to the deadly illness which has claimed the lives of more than 11 000 in the u s according to johns hopkins university which is tracking coronavirus statistics the federal government has tapped into its stockpile of medical supplies known as the strategic national stockpile in an effort to bolster state capabilities many of the details surrounding the stockpile are kept secret including its precise contents and the locations of strategically placed warehouses though president trump revealed monday that there are 9 000 ventilators left in the national stockpile but greg burel who served as the director of the strategic national stockpile for 12 years until his retirement in january answered questions about the country s reserve which stands at the ready should the nation face a chemical biological radiological or nuclear attack natural disaster or a pandemic when the strategic national stockpile was first started in 1999 what was the intention and ultimate goal for having massive amounts of different equipment burel the initial intention of the strategic national stockpile when it was founded in 1999 was to be prepared for potential problems related to if you recall y2k and the concern about computers not working and people not being able to order things they needed and so on there was a tie with that to concern with that if a healthcare need arose because of equipment failure with computer systems and that there needed to be some backup of some kind of material that could be provided the next thing though to think about is most of that was considered in terms of chemical biological radiological and nuclear terrorism preparedness because the concern was if something happened in that kind of a period that would be a great time for a terrorist to try to attack you knowing that there would be all of these other issues that existed in the years since its start has the function of the strategic national stockpile shifted burel the primary purpose of the strategic national stockpile is still and has always been to be prepared to respond to chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrm events we began to expand to more of an all hazards mission over time because of the fact that we know some of the materials we hold for those purposes are useful in say natural events we re also at the same time developing federal medical stations when you see dhs and fema saying we re setting up these 250 bed temporary hospital things those are sns s federal medical stations they re setting up all of those things were planned to be used if we had a cbrm event but they are also useful obviously in any kind of natural event whether it be a hurricane flood fire pandemic whatever in 2005 2006 there were supplemental appropriations to be prepared for pandemic influenza in 2009 the nation was struck with h1n1 pandemic influenza so in response to h1n1 pandemic influenza we deployed material that we had been stockpiling to respond to a pandemic influenza the plan was to be prepared for a pandemic influenza event we were not as high a level as we would like but we were prepared for pandemic influenza pandemic influenza struck we moved a good portion of our materials forward to the states so they would have those available for pandemic influenza response at the same time the states had been preparing in most cases for pandemic influenza themselves so many of the states at that time had their own pandemic stockpiles it varied from state to state some were large some were small some didn t have them at all but in 2009 we were hit with pandemic influenza and we used that material was the material ever replenished burel unfortunately we never received further appropriations designated to replace that material and the funds to replace that were never incorporated in our annual base appropriation so our mission remains to be prepared for chemical biological radiological and nuclear events and we never received additional funding to cover more material for pandemic when you say more material for pandemic in particular is that things like ventilators vaccines personal protective equipment burel you can t buy vaccines for a pandemic disease event because you don t know what the vaccine is going to be and you know we re currently in this race to make the vaccine so you couldn t have invested in vaccines had we wanted to ventilators also have requirements that relate to cbrn type events so we have continued to buy ventilators knowing they have multiple uses some personal protective equipment have been purchased over the years because it s appropriate for other needs as well but the massive amount that was projected for 1918 type pandemic influenza 1 could never have been achieved with the supplemental appropriations that were received in 05 and 06 and 2 much of what we had was used in 09 and was never restocked to the level that it had been at that point who oversees the stockpile and who decides what to purchase burel first the strategic national stockpile is currently in the organization and is responsive under the organization structure of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at hhs prior to that it was under cdc we moved to hhs in 2018 to be closer to the decision making center about deployment and so on it also allowed us to consolidate all of hhs material response capability in a single organizational line which i think made a lot of sense the formulary that is what is held in the strategic national stockpile is determined by a multiagency governance body called the public health emergency medical countermeasures enterprise and we shorten that as we do everything in government to phemce phemce is comprised of experts in various matters related to disease drug development device development regulatory matters and so on from the centers for disease control and prevention the food and drug administration the national institutes of health dr anthony fauci s niaid and then a number of other departments and agencies including dod va dhs and others what the phemce does is it looks at threat projections based on information from department of homeland security it works to model and consider what the event would look like around those threats that are identified by the dhs and then we try to identify with the disease experts and the people who know way more about this than i ever will what are the most important things to keep in the stockpile there s always a longer list of things that we want to have than there is money to buy so part of what the phemce does is annually it does a review line item by line item of every product in the stockpile and what we need to spend to keep us at established goals based on models that predict what we would need as we try to work through the limited funds that are appropriated against the long list of things that we need the phemce makes recommendations to the secretary and the assistant secretary about what things are most important to buy in terms of what the stockpile looks like today and the supplies that have been compiled over the years based on this long list what is in it burel it s over an 8 billion or was before this started going out an 8 billion inventory of various materials including things like antibiotics antitoxins antidotes vaccines medical surgical material federal medical stations you see ventilators and other products we never release the precise content of the stockpile or the numbers of each precise item in the stockpile because of the risks that would present in giving to a determined adversary a roadmap to well they have this so if i do this to them instead of that i m going to be more successful let s take it completely out of the realm of anything that we re prepared for so we don t disclose anything but if you re prepared for the zombie apocalypse you don t want to tell people how prepared you are for that because then they ll just say instead of releasing the zombie agent on them we ll release something else that s the risk of letting anybody know exactly what s in it and then the risk of letting anybody know exactly where it is is that that same determined adversary before they did something bad to us could say well i know where it is so i m going to take it out you don t want somebody who wishes you ill will to be able to destroy your capability to respond to whatever they re doing to do bad to you you also don t want people whether they are ill intentioned or well intentioned to know where those locations are and suddenly show up there at the time we re trying to move material out of them trying to get it for themselves or trying to interdict that material so we can t get it where it s going there are many risks involved in making the location of sns material public it would cause i fear an immediate failure i would imagine now that we are seeing this stockpile being very quickly depleted how fast can it be replenished especially in the midst of a nationwide event burel when you say being depleted it is being depleted of materials that are important for this response so there are things for other types of events obviously still there to the question of how rapidly it can be replenished it really is something you have to look at on a line item by line item by line item evaluation what the strategic national stockpile has to do today is as it continues to acquire additional material if those material are still being needed outside and we ve always planned for this we can do several things we can have suppliers to us take them immediately to where they need to be dependent upon how many places they need to respond to we can have them shipped to us and then we can further ship them out to places where they need to go but what the strategic national stockpile i would guess is not doing today is ordering things and putting it on the shelf and not getting it where it needs to go i would not expect that that would not be what we are prepared to do what is the process for a state like california or washington or new york to get supplies from the strategic national stockpile is it the first place they turn or supposed to be later on in the process burel when there is an event of any type and this is the fact for all emergency responses in the united states the federal government s responsibility is to begin to assist in response when state and local capabilities are exhausted in this type of an event what i would expect to see is that the medical supply chain should try to surge to meet the needs of the private sector health care complex secondly states and locals who can invest monies that they have themselves from their own state budgets or from grant monies from the federal government there have been a lot of public health preparedness grant monies and cooperative agreement funds that have gone to states in the last 10 years or so or more they can invest that in buying and storing materials the point is that the way this should work is once the medical supply chain is exhausted then those health care needs should flow up to the state once the state stocks assuming that there are any are exhausted then they turn to the strategic national stockpile normally the request process is a state makes a request through the secretary s operations center that s rapidly evaluated and responded to in a nationwide pandemic event like this we re still working on that same kind of a theory we ve worked with all the states for pandemic influenza planning and talked to them about this pro rata approach so it s nothing new a chronic problem in public health preparedness is and it s our chronic problem in emergency preparedness overall the farther you move away from events that drive that preparedness in the minds of the public and in the mind of the congress and the mind of the state legislature it is less of a need to appropriate funds from limited available monies to plan i m not necessarily criticizing the congress or state legislatures for not doing that because there are many competing priorities for limited funds but the reality is public health preparedness needs to be a priority and it needs to be routinely funded at a much higher level across the country than it has been for a long time and then it would be better prepared to deal with these kinds of events in terms of supplies how often is inventory checked to ensure vaccines and other materials haven t expired burel it s a continuous process so when we consider what s in the stockpile we run very large systems that we monitor daily so that we are aware of what is aging where we stand in terms of needing to make new acquisitions to replace aging material so they can be rotated and so on the strategic national stockpile also participates in many programs to extend the useful life of our material one of those is the shelf life extension program which is an agreement between dod and fda that we ride along with dod on where certain drugs can be identified they can be subject to a chemical assay where very specialized scientists at the fda can look at the review of the assay and say yea this is still safe and effective for use and based on the data we re going to let you extend the expiry date of this drug for x amount of time for chemical drugs we try to extend it through the shelf life extension program for the longest possible time that we can make that investment sound and that means that in addition to looking at rotating things out we re looking at things that have to go into the shelf life extension program for sampling and analysis and a determination from the fda the other thing that we do is we do ongoing maintenance on durable medical equipment like ventilators all of those get rotated back to their manufactures annually for preventative maintenance and all the necessary maintenance to make sure that they re still functional and operational as far as some of these medical devices like n95 masks and that kind of thing there has been limited data available about how long you can use them after their expiry date we ve worked with niosh national institute for occupational safety and hazard over the last couple of years to try to study products that not just the sns held but that some states were still holding and that some other laboratories were holding old stock to test that stock and see if it was still safe and effective you may find on cdc s public facing website data that niosh accumulated and studies they did that say those n95s that show an expired date are still safe and effective for use as long as the elastic doesn t break when you try to put it on what we try to do is extend the federal government s investments in all of those products as long as we can so even though states have said they received expired n95 masks that doesn t necessarily mean they can t be used or that they re not as effective burel that is correct is there anything further the general public should know about the strategic national stockpile burel what the general public should think about is that there is a strong need to fund public health at all levels at the federal state and local levels and a part of that is the strategic national stockpile but that s really only a part and pubic health needs advocacy at all levels to assure that it is funded in such a way that the public is protected this is not just a matter of whether people are getting sick but it s actually a matter of national security and it needs to be take as seriously as funding the department of defense to be prepared for anything it needs to be prepared for do you think the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a shift in the mindset of lawmakers to put public health front of mind burel as devastating as this event is and i don t see this as silver lining or anything but i hope that it makes some of the people that in the past have said public health preparedness is not as important as whatever will now look at this and say you know what we should be allocating money for this we should be thinking about this in a different way dr fauci has warned the coronavirus could be seasonal is there anything congress can do now to ensure the strategic national stockpile is ready in the future especially as we await a vaccine burel congress has appropriated supplemental funds to address this but what congress must do from this point forward is look at making those supplemental funds not a once and done thing if we invest those supplemental funds today in new material to be prepared for a second wave of a next season event or whatever and we don t get that included in our base appropriations for long term we will not be able to maintain that preparedness just like the pandemic influenza i think there s another piece to this with dr fauci suggesting this may become a seasonal event then the private supply chain is going to have to reconsider how it prepares and i believe we must move away from a purely just in time inventory in the health care sector it s fantastic if i m building a car and i don t want to store the parts and the parts arrive the day i build the car and the car comes off the line and i m done but health care doesn t work that way we don t suddenly see the need to build 2 000 more cars than we do in one day on a normal basis but we do see in health care and in public health the need often in a large outbreak to be able to respond to far more people than we would think we have to take care of first published on april 7 2020 4 17 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know get the latest breaking news delivered straight to your inbox copyright 2020
