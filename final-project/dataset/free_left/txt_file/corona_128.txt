what are the symptoms of this coronavirus where did it come from how will the pandemic end editor s note april 2 there have been significant developments in the coronavirus pandemic since this story was last updated here is our latest information on the big questions about the coronavirus as of this writing for our most up to date coverage visit our coronavirus hub the coronavirus outbreak which began in china keeps evolving at a dizzying speed with the global case toll rising steeply face masks flying off store shelves borders around the world closing and meetings cruise itineraries and the global economy upended by the virus it s no wonder questions and fears are swirling about covid 19 as the disease is known on march 11 the who declared the outbreak a pandemic a new disease that has spread around the world many countries have seen reported cases of the virus rise within their borders and that includes the us we will see more cases and things will get worse anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases told members of the house oversight committee on march 11 how much worse will depend on our ability to do two things to contain the influx in people who are infected coming from the outside and the ability to contain and mitigate within our own country spread of the virus and the slow rollout of testing mean reported case numbers are changing quickly meanwhile outbreaks have been surging in south korea italy and iran with the new virus continuing its tour around the world here are answers to your most burning questions coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that typically attack the respiratory system the name comes from the latin word corona for crown and the ancient greek kor n meaning garland or wreath because of the spiky fringe encircling these viruses most coronaviruses infect animals such as bats cats and birds only seven including covid 19 sars and mers are known to infect humans sars is thought to have evolved from infecting bats to civet cats to humans in china mers evolved from bats to camels to humans in the middle east no one knows precisely where covid 19 came from though a leading hypothesis is that bats were once again the original source they spread the virus to another animal species possibly a pangolin where it jumped to humans two of the seven coronaviruses that infect humans sars and mers can cause severe pneumonia and even death in 10 and more than 30 percent of cases respectively but others lead to milder symptoms like a common cold the most common symptoms of covid 19 are fever and dry cough no one knows the precise incubation period for the virus but symptoms can show up anywhere from one day to two weeks after exposure according to a who report on china s response at the moment we know covid 19 can cause pneumonia and that it too can kill but while it seems to be less deadly than sars and mers it s not yet clear by precisely how much some of the best evidence on the question comes from a february 16 china center for disease control report looking at the outcomes of the first 72 314 patients with confirmed or suspected covid 19 in mainland china it s the largest such analysis to date and it found an overall case fatality rate of 2 3 percent lower than both sars and mers the case fatality rate or cfr is the proportion of deaths a disease causes within a group of people who have the disease the researchers also discovered a huge variation in the case fatality rate by age group in short the virus appears to be deadlier in people with each passing decade you can see the trend in this graph overall the researchers characterized 81 percent of the cases as mild and 19 percent as severe or critical one major caveat though this data comes from mainland china and the case fatality rate has been different outside of china at the same time there s also evidence of asymptomatic cases and it s possible that as we discover more of these cases covid 19 will look less deadly that s because infectious diseases typically look more severe when they re first discovered since the people showing up in hospitals tend to be the sickest disease modelers who account for this under counting of cases currently estimate an overall case fatality rate of just over 1 percent as for symptoms fever dry cough and fatigue are more common while thick mucus from coughs shortness of breath sore throat and headache are less common according to china s data but the picture might change as data on symptoms emerge from other countries for example a yet to be published german paper looked at some of the country s earliest confirmed covid 19 patients researchers found symptoms in this small sample often resembled a cold so only two of the nine patients had a fever and seven had a cough but just as common were symptoms like stuffy nose runny nose and sneezing if you re in a high risk group over the age of 60 with an underlying health condition seek medical treatment immediately and let your hospital or health care provider know you suspect covid 19 before showing up otherwise stay at home and call a health professional vox s umair irfan explained they will work with your local health department and figure out whether you need to get tested or get treatment doctors and health officials advise not to go to the emergency room if your symptoms do not appear to be life threatening there s a good chance you ll recover with nothing more than rest and fluids but you will need to self isolate while sick to avoid spreading the disease to others including any people in your home here s how to do it the cdc recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of covid 19 guidance may change stay informed and stay safe with vox s coronavirus coverage hub and if you are healthy here are some ways you can help vulnerable people in your community we don t yet know exactly how sars cov 2 the virus that causes the covid 19 disease spreads but we do have a lot of data on how mers sars and other respiratory viruses move from person to person and that s mainly through exposure to droplets from coughing or sneezing related so when an infected person coughs or sneezes they let out a spray and if these droplets reach the nose eyes or mouth of another person they can pass on the virus said jennifer nuzzo an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security in rarer cases a person might catch a respiratory disease indirectly via touching droplets on surfaces and then touching mucosal membranes in the mouth eyes and nose she added there s also emerging evidence showing that sars cov 2 may spread through poop known as the fecal oral route of disease transmission researchers are on the lookout for potential airborne transmission too and there s a lot of speculation about whether inanimate objects like door handles can pass on the virus in the case of airborne transmission a person would get infected by directly inhaling droplets suspended in the air from an infected individual with fomites objects that can transmit infections droplets from an infected person would end up on surfaces another person touches so far there is no conclusive evidence of that wrote megan murray a harvard infectious disease specialist in a coronavirus explainer although that is challenging to prove one way or the other what we do know more and more research is piling up to suggest people who have only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all can test positive for covid 19 disease the virus also appears to be present in the body at very high levels early on in an illness when people are still going to work or traveling we still don t know to what extent people without symptoms can infect nuzzo cautioned and isaac bogoch a professor at the university of toronto told vox even if there have been cases of asymptomatic transmission of this infection those will be typically rare cases and with just about every other respiratory tract infection known to humankind those are not the people who are driving an epidemic even so if this virus can spread from people with no or mild symptoms it might help explain why it s so contagious researchers currently believe one person with covid 19 generally infects two to more than three others which would make the new coronavirus more transmissible than seasonal flu sars and mers that s why social distancing measures are so important in the us just about every health expert vox has spoken to has said there s little evidence to support the use of face masks for preventing disease in the general population masks are only useful if you have a respiratory infection already and want to minimize the risk of spread to others or if you re caring for someone who is sick or working in a hospital in direct contact with people who have respiratory illnesses plus there are reports of runs on masks and other supplies that health workers need to stay safe if they can t get them and start walking off the job we re all in trouble related that s why the cdc advises against the use of masks for regular americans the best thing you can do to prevent all sorts of illnesses cdc s nancy messonnier said is wash your hands cover your cough take care of yourself and keep alert to the information that we re providing individuals at a higher risk of developing severe disease the elderly people with underlying health conditions should take additional precautions avoiding crowds and contact with people who are sick and stocking up on medicines and groceries messonnier said the who has officially declared the outbreak a pandemic with the disease in more than 100 countries and major epidemics in several regions of the world that means containing the virus fully halting its spread is no longer the goal but rather mitigation of fast spread and harm reduction keep in mind the p word doesn t say anything about the severity of covid 19 a disease can spread widely and become a pandemic without being particularly severe and no one knows yet what the ultimate effects of this pandemic will look like mostly because we don t yet know precisely how lethal the disease is there was a time when it seemed possible that china might contain the virus and the outbreaks outside of china would fizzle out spelling the end of this public health emergency but there are now so many around the world and the very real possibility that the virus is circulating undetected in even more countries especially those with weak health systems that containment appears out of reach this means we re likely to see more sickness and death in many countries as cases grow from one off travelers or small clusters to full blown outbreaks in this scenario the nih s fauci said you don t try to control the virus because it s already everywhere health officials are now in the mitigation phase of the response strategy this involves a focus on social distancing to slow the speed of the outbreak and avoid overwhelming health systems it also involves ramping up public health communications to inform the public about the disease testing of potential cases to find sick people and their contacts and capacity in hospitals so hospitals need to be ready with covid 19 protocols so the disease doesn t spread from them and health care workers need to be protected with access to protective equipment such as face masks so they can keep doing their jobs countries also need plans in place for maintaining supply chains and carrying on with travel and trade the slow rollout of testing in the us in particular has made slowing the spread of the virus more difficult an investigation led by the atlantic and independent researchers found that a little more than 7 000 people in the us had been tested as of march 11 putting the us far behind other developed countries the covid tracking project team is now gathering test counts daily slowing epidemics is critical in preventing more deaths as it reduces stress on hospitals and health centers which can only treat a certain number of patients at a time that s why flattening the curve of the pandemic through social distancing measures is so important as eliza barclay and dylan scott wrote for vox a disastrous inundation of hospitals can likely be averted with protective measures we re now seeing more of closing schools canceling mass gatherings working from home self quarantine self isolation avoiding crowds to keep the virus from spreading fast in the best case scenario which has become less likely this outbreak might look more like h1n1 swine flu when h1n1 was first recognized in 2009 and spread around the world there were major concerns about its lethality us schools closed people from north america were quarantined when they arrived in other countries flights were canceled not only did those measures fail to contain the virus nuzzo said but it also turned out h1n1 wasn t all that deadly now we re still living with that virus it s one that circulates with every flu season nuzzo explained the cdc has issued its highest level travel alerts for italy iran south korea and china advising americans to avoid traveling in these places for the moment these are the countries with the largest known coronavirus outbreaks on march 11 president donald trump issued a ban on travel from most of europe for 30 days but just because a country you plan to visit isn t on the list right now doesn t mean it won t be there tomorrow the outbreak is evolving rapidly and these advisories are likely to change in the coming days so keep checking in with the cdc this map and list of travel restrictions from the council on foreign relations is another good resource as nuzzo told vox i m more concerned about the unpredictability of the outbreak response at this point it would not be fun to go to china and get stuck there somehow and coming back you ll be subject to additional screening or quarantines what if you decide to travel and you re seated near someone who is coughing or sneezing that s not very reassuring but it s not time to panic either the risk of acquiring a respiratory infection through air travel is still extraordinarily low bogoch who studies how air travel influences the dynamics of outbreaks including the new coronavirus infection the risk does go up if you happen to be seated within six feet of a person with a respiratory infection but even there simple proximity doesn t necessarily mean you ll catch anything instead the more infectious the person is and the longer you sit near them the higher your risk if you re not near the person for very long or they re not very infectious the risk is lower also keep in mind the travel warnings are not entirely driven by the risk of catching this new virus airlines have been canceling or scaling back flights trains have been halted and countries have been imposing quarantines on travelers and citizens on january 30 the who declared the outbreak a global public health emergency and about a month later said it had become a pandemic a dramatic and unprecedented response played out in china the country with the most covid 19 cases china has implemented the most extensive cordon sanitaire or quarantine in the history of humankind gostin told vox they ve restricted movements caused fear and panic they ve violated human rights but they also managed to get more control over the outbreak and cases are now declining related italy has adopted quarantine measures that are similar to china first locking down some 16 million people in the country s north where the virus has been spreading and then extending restrictions on movement to the entire country some governments have so far been able to halt the spread of coronavirus within their borders seemingly through quick action in taiwan a small island close to mainland china testing for covid 19 began in late december even as china was just beginning to discover cases and ramp up its response the taiwanese government also emphasized public education about curbing the disease s spread taiwan has only reported one death from the virus as of march 11 in recent weeks the us government dramatically escalated its response issuing its highest level travel advisories quarantining citizens evacuated from china and banning foreign nationals who have recently been to china from coming in as well as travelers from iran on march 11 trump announced a 30 day travel ban from most of europe to the us excluding the uk the cdc warned on february 25 there may be a lot more to come disruption to everyday life might be severe this means americans can expect more cancellations quarantines and social distancing efforts to read more about those see this explainer the severe measures can be explained by the fact that there s still a lot we don t know about this new virus and health officials are taking drastic actions there s also no enforceable international law governing outbreak responses so countries can basically do what they want in response to pandemic threats without getting penalized even if those actions are proportional or science based and the who is advising against them there are a few ways this outbreak could end as vox s brian resnick explained perhaps public health measures identifying cases fast putting infected people in isolation will slow the spread of this coronavirus that s what stopped the spread of sars in 2003 if we slow it so that infections happen over 10 or 12 months instead of over one month that s going to make a big difference as far as how many people seriously infected how many people may end up hospitalized and how many they end up dying said tara smith a kent state university epidemiologist we talk about it as flattening the epidemic curve so that it s not a big sudden peak in cases but it s a more moderate plateau over time because this is a zoonotic disease meaning it came from an animal finding and eliminating that source would also help or maybe a vaccine or antiviral will be invented quickly to curb a broader epidemic though a vaccine is expected to take at least a year related the coming seasons of warmer weather could also play a role in at least slowing down the virus coronaviruses are winter viruses fauci said when the weather is warm and moist these viruses don t spread as well as when the weather is cold and dry covid 19 could also keep spreading at a high rate and become endemic regularly infecting humans like the common cold either way it s going to have tremendous really negative and lasting effects for the most vulnerable people who are either medically or economically vulnerable in our society angela rasmussen a columbia virologist told vox correction march 3 a graphic in this piece previously misstated the percentage of cases in china that were not linked back to the wuhan area
