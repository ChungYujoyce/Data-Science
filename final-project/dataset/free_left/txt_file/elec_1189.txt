 first read is a morning briefing from meet the press and the nbc political unit on the day s most important political stories and why they matter begun the cruz rubio immigration war has the immigration fight between ted cruz and marco rubio is fully on after cruz blasted rubio at tuesday s debate for his co authorship of the gang of eight immigration reform bill and then after rubio fired back on wednesday cruz clearly supported legalization i know he doesn t say that in iowa he takes it out of his stump speech rubio told nbc s hallie jackson yesterday but i know for a fact that he supported an amendment in the u s senate when we were debating the immigration bill where he flat out bragged about the fact that he wasn t undoing the legalization cruz has responded that the amendment rubio is talking about was a poison pill amendment intended to thwart the overall legislation and cruz gets a boost here when you find out that sen jeff sessions r al maybe the most hardline anti immigration voice in the senate voted for the same amendment that cruz backed still you have to credit team rubio for muddying the waters on what could very well be his campaign s biggest liability gang of eight and cruz s performance in that fox news interview was shaky at best but ask yourself what conservative voters will care about in the next six weeks rubio standing shoulder to shoulder with chuck schumer or cruz voting with jeff sessions once you start down the dark path forever it will dominate your destiny here s another question we have which side team cruz or team rubio goes up first with tv ads hitting the other on this immigration issue for more on this immigration debate be sure to read msnbc s benjy sarlin who has everything you wanted to know about this fight and here is nbc s hallie jackson behind the scenes with rubio on the campaign trail this site is protected by recaptchaprivacy policy terms of service do or do not there is no try so the story about jeb bush maybe deciding to say he won t vote for trump has been more than 24 hours old but here s the deal the longer bush deliberates this plan of action it only explains why his campaign and candidacy seem so flawed in this political environment indeed while campaigning in arizona yesterday trump already said he didn t care what bush ultimately does i don t care if a guy like jeb bush never endorses me it wouldn t bother me at all i think it s a negative as yoda who we ve been quoting in our headlines today with the new star wars movie out might also say here that is why you fail always two there are no more no less a master and an apprentice the new york times last night scooped that defense secretary ash carter also used private email to conduct official business even after the story about hillary clinton s emails broke defense secretary ashton b carter relied on a personal email account to conduct a portion of his government business during his first months at the pentagon according to white house and defense department officials and copies of mr carter s emails obtained by the new york times more mr carter continued the practice which violated defense department rules for at least two months after it was publicly revealed in march that hillary clinton had exclusively used a personal email account as secretary of state the officials said it is not clear when mr carter stopped using the account but an administration official said that when the white house chief of staff denis r mcdonough learned about mr carter s email practices in may mr mcdonough directed the white house counsel s office to contact the defense department to ask why mr carter was relying on the personal account ouch difficult to see always in motion is the future a funny thing has happened after congressional republicans cut a deal with democrats and the obama white house on a 1 trillion plus spending bill the conservative right has been pretty quiet at least so
