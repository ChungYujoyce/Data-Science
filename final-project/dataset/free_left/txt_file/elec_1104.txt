 ap photo the sunday evening meeting comes after an eruption of complaints by the candidates about the debates by alex isenstadt 10 29 2015 09 07 pm edt updated 10 29 2015 09 50 pm edt republican presidential campaigns are planning to gather in washington d c on sunday evening to plot how to alter their party s messy debate process and how to remove power from the hands of the republican national committee not invited to the meeting anyone from the rnc which many candidates have openly criticized in the hours since wednesday s cnbc debate in boulder colorado a chaotic disorganized affair that was widely panned by political observers advertisement on thursday many of the campaigns told politico that the rnc which has taken a greater role in the 2016 debate process than in previous election cycles had failed to take their concerns into account it was time top aides to at least half a dozen of the candidates agreed to begin discussing among themselves how the next debates should be structured and not leave it up to the rnc and television networks the gathering is being organized by advisers to the campaigns of donald trump ben carson bobby jindal and lindsey graham according to multiple sources involved in the planning others who are expected to attend organizers say are representatives for carly fiorina mike huckabee rand paul marco rubio and rick santorum the planners are also reaching out to other republican candidates spokespersons for the rnc did not immediately respond to a request for comment i think the campaigns have a number of concerns and they have a right to talk about that amongst themselves said christian ferry graham s campaign manager the objective ferry said was to find out what works best for us as a group figuring that out could be contentious as each campaign has a number of different complaints about the process some such as bush and paul have griped about unequal speaking time others have complained bitterly about how polling is used to determine who qualifies for the prime time and undercard debates some have insisted on giving opening and closing statements despite the networks desire to have the candidates spend as much time as possible clashing with each other on stage jindal who polls better in iowa than he does nationally has argued that criteria for determining who qualifies for debates should be based on early state polling not just national surveys by eliza collins our continuous complaint is candidate exclusion and the delusional debate polling criteria it s unacceptable said gail gitcho a jindal spokeswoman maybe this meeting will change that maybe it won t but we aren t going to shut up about it graham s campaign has argued that there should be two debates with two groups of seven or eight candidates selected randomly carson said on thursday that he had asked his staff to contact other campaigns to propose format changes without sharing specifically what he thinks those changes should be it s not about me and gotcha questions it s about the american people and whether they have the right to hear what we think carson said before an event at colorado christian university the whole format was just craziness you got to be really bad for the whole crowd to boo you i think the families need to get together here because these debates as structured by the rnc are not helping the party carson campaign manager barry bennett told the washington examiner there s not enough time to talk about your plans there s no presentation it s just a slugfest all we do is change moderators and the trendline is horrific so i think there needs to be wholesale change here rubio largely considered the standout of wednesday s debate said the questions from cnbc s moderators became irritating as the night wore on by nick gass i think the bigger frustration you saw is that all those candidates onstage had prepared for a substantive debate everyone was ready to talk about trade policy and the debt and tax policies rubio said on fox news and we re ready for that everybody was and then you got questions that everyone got which were clearly designed to get us to fight against each other or get us to say something embarrassing about us and then get us to react the campaigns are not going to allow the networks to control this process huckabee told fox business host lou dobbs on thursday night trump meanwhile has repeatedly demanded that the debates last no longer than two hours on wednesday night he even boasted of muscling cnbc into changing the format for the third debate everybody said it was going to be three hours three and a half including them and in about two minutes i renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here he said not bad sources at fox business network the hosts of the next gop debate on nov 10 said that as of thursday afternoon they hadn t heard from any campaigns or the rnc about their debate format but that they weren t concerned they pointed to positive reviews of the first gop debate hosted by fox news and noted that though it s fox business first debate viewers and the candidates can expect the same results next month with
