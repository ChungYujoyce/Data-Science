the following is a transcript of the interview with presidential candidate beto o rourke that aired sunday may 26 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan good morning and welcome to face the nation we begin today with former texas congressman beto o rourke he s running for the democratic presidential nomination we caught up with him yesterday in his hometown of el paso on the border of mexico so there are about 16 000 migrants in u s detention facilities right now what should happen to them o rourke most of those asylum seeking migrants pose no threat or danger to the united states we know from past history that when we connect them with case managers in a community they have a ninety nine percent chance of meeting their court dates and their appointments with ice in other words we do a better job of helping them to follow our laws when they have case managers in the community and it costs us a tenth of what we pay to keep them in detention and in custody margaret brennan so in other words catch and release is something you support o rourke no i wouldn t call it catch and release i i d call it helping those who are seeking asylum in this country to follow our laws if at the end of that process they must return to their country of origin i want to make sure that they follow our laws and go back to the country from which they they left in the first place i think we ve got to ask ourselves during an administration that has caged children that has deported their moms back to the very countries from which they ve fled that have continued this separation that is visiting a cruelty and a torture on these families that has lost the lives of six children within our custody whether or not we can do better and live our values and whether or not there will be a reckoning and accountability for this margaret brennan but but just to put a fine point on it you re talking about 16 000 people in custody right now are you saying that migrants who cross and do so not through port of entry who are here through illegal means essentially that they would not be detained in an o rourke administration o rourke not necessarily in every case but i think the vast majority of families and children who are fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet who are seeking asylum in this country they don t try to flee arrest they don t try to evade detection those families pose no threats or risk to this country margaret brennan should they be detained together those families o rourke those families if they pose no threat to this country or to the communities in which they are apprehended should be released with a case manager who ensures that they follow our laws that they attend their court hearings that they meet their appointments with an ice officer margaret brennan i want to ask you about your campaign there are some headlines i ll read for you the washington post this week cited brutal new 2020 numbers for beto o rourke beto o rourke blew it the beto balloon burst what are you doing wrong do you think you re doing something wrong o rourke look i feel really good about the way that we re campaigning i m going to people where they are in their communities no me importa i do not care how red or blue rural or urban i m showing up to listen to them and what they re telling me is they want this country to come together around our shared challenges so i m listening to them more than i am to the headline margaret brennan you have though relaunched acknowledging that things weren t registering for you you ve apologized for the vanity fair cover can you escape some of those first impressions of you beto o rourke listen the the only way that i m going to have any chance is to go everywhere meet with everyone leave no one behind and take no one for granted so so that s what i m focused on margaret brennan is this saying though that maybe with the vanity fair cover and and the big launch that you looked out of step o rourke i don t know about that listen the opportunities that i ve had to meet with people the snarkiness the cynicism all that is gone it s folks wanting to know that we re gonna find a way to ensure that every child can go to school without worried about whether or not they re gonna come home at the end of the day in this epidemic of gun violence having those conversations on the issues that are most important to them is what drives me it it produces this relentless energy that we ve got in our campaign to make sure that we connect draw people in and meet these historic challenges together so i feel really good about doing this and listen there are going to be highs and lows in this campaign there have been in every campaign that i have ever run but if we stay focused on people the very reason that we re doing this in the first place bringing them in and allowing them to contribute to the solutions to the challenges that we face i don t think there s anything that can stop us margaret brennan do you think the party needs generational change o rourke i m driven by the people who see the urgency of this moment who who understand that we ve got ten years left to us to meet this challenge of climate change after which these floods and fires and droughts and disasters will pale in comparison those students who are talking to me about gun violence the folks who demand that we have universal guaranteed high quality care all i know is that we need to match that with a relentless energy that brings in people who may have been left out before and what i hope that i ve been able to demonstrate in texas leading the largest grassroots campaign in our state s history is that we were able to do that margaret brennan it sounds like you re saying yes it sounds like you re saying you need more sort of revolution versus the idea of restoration you need a young candidate is that what you re saying someone like you and not a joe biden or bernie sanders who are in their 70s o rourke we need to be able to bring in new energy we need to be able to bring in new voters we need to make sure that this democracy so badly damaged works for everyone all i m saying is that the way that i campaign this this relentless pursuit of people wherever they are learning their stories incorporating what s most important to them in their lives into this campaign and into the service that i want to perform for this country is what we need at this very divided moment so that s the way that i offer my service going forward margaret brennan do you support this latest bailout of farmers o rourke from listening to farmers that i ve met all over this country and especially in iowa they re not looking for bailouts they want to connect with those markets that they have worked a lifetime to establish markets that are now closed to them margaret brennan china o rourke because of this trade war because of these tariffs they re no longer able to make a profit doing what they do best and they will not be able to pass these farms and ranches on to the next generation so yes in the short term we absolutely have to make sure that they re okay but we should never have been in this place in the first place and what we see right now is yet another example of president trump being both the arsonist who created this problem in the first place and the firefighter who wants the credit for addressing it through this bailout margaret brennan who is america s greatest adversary right now o rourke we face a number of of adversaries on on the world stage from isis to to north korea to iran and yet the adversary that has successfully invaded this country through our democracy russia through their leader vladimir putin is the country and the person who this president holds closest after the mueller report was released our president called vladimir putin spent an hour on the phone with him described the resulting report as a hoax giving putin a green light to further interfere in our democracy we ve got the most dangerous person who s ever held office in the white house right now who s inviting the involvement of our our greatest adversaries and we ve got to be able to stand up not as democrats but as americans to this challenge and so i want to make sure that we do that margaret brennan can you say one nice thing about president trump o rourke listen when i was first elected to congress the greatest challenge that we faced here in this country and especially in this city was the inability for veterans to be able to get in and see a mental health care provider it was producing a crisis in suicide that is claiming 20 veterans lives a day as a member of congress we wrote legislation to improve access to mental health care for veterans worked with republican colleagues to get that done and that bill was signed into law by president trump i agree with him on almost nothing but the fact that we were able to find the common ground to get this done to serve those who have put their lives on the line for this country is something that i m grateful to him for margaret brennan i want to quickly ask you about some of those things regarding veterans do you think president trump was right to send these fifteen hundred troops to the middle east to counter the iran threat o rourke no president trump is escalating tensions is provoking yet another war in the middle east where we find ourselves already engaged in war in so many countries in iraq in syria in yemen not too far from there in libya and in afghanistan so we don t need another war we need to find a way to work with allies and partners and in some cases with our enemies margaret brennan so do you doubt the u s intelligence that said there was a threat on the ground to u s forces in iraq o rourke i i have a really hard time believing this administration and believing a a president who has so wantonly lied and misconstrued the facts at every single turn to his own gain i m i m suspicious of a national security team that has so often called for war you have someone in in bolton who has publicly said that he wants regime change in iran the body count in in that kind of war on on both sides will not be measured in the hundreds or the thousands but the tens or hundreds of thousands if there is a peaceful alternative to this and i know that there is then we must do everything within our power to pursue it and that s what i would do in my administration i d stick up for our values make sure that we defend our allies protect the lives of our fellow americans but do that peacefully where we can otherwise we will produce more wars more veterans coming back to this country seeking the care that they are being effectively and functionally denied today i think we need to do far better going forward and i know that we can margaret brennan lastly there are 12 000 u s troops in afghanistan you hear almost no discussion of the war that continues to rage there how do you handle that do you bring those troops home o rourke yes margaret brennan when o rourke we ve got to end our war in afghanistan margaret brennan how o rourke we ve got to make sure that we satisfy the conditions that first led us to go to war in the first place that those who perpetrated 9 11 are brought to justice that afghanistan is never again used to stage attacks on the united states of america or americans we have satisfied those conditions now it is time for us to work with the partners in the region to produce a lasting peace and stability and bring our u s service members back home margaret brennan and that includes the taliban brokering a peace deal with them and bringing them into the government o rourke sometimes you don t have the fortune of working just with your allies your friends or the people with whom you agree in order to produce peace you sometimes have to negotiate and work with your enemies and that s true for afghanistan watch cbs news anytime
