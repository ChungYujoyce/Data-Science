advertisement supported by by matt flegenheimer and lisa lerer beto o rourke has driven alone across the plains straining to find his emotional bearings or at least a pancake house in liberal kan he has collected an el pasoan of the year award before a modest audience and smiled coyly through an interview with oprah winfrey before a bigger one he has surfaced on college campuses to listen to students at a metallica concert to listen to metallica and at the premiere of a documentary about his star making senate run in texas at the south by southwest festival to listen to himself on screen he has journaled extensively we re in this together like it or not mr o rourke wrote summarizing the lessons of his recent solo travels in one of several stream of consciousness online posts the alternative is to be in this apart and that would be hell as the democratic presidential field takes final shape mr o rourke seems inclined to be in this according to interviews with people who have spoken to him and other top democrats he says he has made a decision about whether to run and could announce it as early as this week unsettling prospective rival campaigns that consider mr o rourke a credible threat yet in the four months since his senate loss mr o rourke 46 has done little to demonstrate the kind of intensive preparation building national political infrastructure projecting a signature policy rationale for a candidacy typically associated with a top flight presidential campaign there has been no flirtation tour in iowa no trip to new hampshire since his college years as an ivy league rower mr o rourke had no traditional campaign in waiting at the ready after the midterms the sort of operation available to a more experienced holdout like former vice president joseph r biden jr or carefully built over months by first time presidential candidates like senators elizabeth warren cory booker and kamala harris few doubt mr o rourke s capacity to upend the race regardless buoyed by a talent for relentless retail politics a formidable low dollar fund raising army and an unsubtle contrast to front runners in their 70s like mr biden and senator bernie sanders he also can count on help from several veterans of former president barack obama s campaigns one of them paul tewes mr obama s 2008 iowa state director has been helping to plan mr o rourke s candidacy according to three democrats familiar with the effort and mr o rourke is expected to appear in iowa this weekend to campaign for a local candidate in an upcoming special election sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race but perhaps no major 2020 player invites as many question marks as mr o rourke and his drawn out non candidacy has provided few answers is this the moment for a relatively untested white male in a party eager to elevate female and nonwhite voices in the quest to dethrone president trump can mr o rourke scale up to a national campaign without losing the intimate semi improvisational feel of his perpetually live streamed senate bid and in a primary where some top candidates have already sought to establish progressive litmus tests on key issues what does mr o rourke actually believe he s still an open book said maurice mitchell national director for the working families party he sort of catapulted himself into the national spotlight without answering a lot of questions about where he stands amanda litman a democratic strategist who worked for hillary clinton in 2016 wondered aloud if mr o rourke would be considered a top tier candidate if he wasn t a handsome young white man he s certainly effective at communicating the values behind a policy she said but that may not cut it in a primary where we all share the same values and are debating the execution on those values mr o rourke has betrayed little concern about catering to his left flank people close to him say a central takeaway from speaking to disparate audiences in recent months is that voters are far less ideological than some in the party might believe supplying an opening mr o rourke senses for a unifying figure in a bog of partisan warriors check out the democratic field with our candidate tracker robby mook mrs clinton s campaign manager in 2016 said that mr o rourke stands apart as a politician who can drive his own news independent of mr trump alluding to his history of social media ready flourishes on the campaign trail it s not just a matter of being authentic mr mook said it s authentically taking on trump and challenging political norms still most candidates considered to be top 2020 contenders tend to check at least one of the following three boxes a firm policy bedrock anchoring their campaigns like the economic platforms of mr sanders or ms warren the potential to make history like ms harris or her female senate peers in the field or deep experience and national standing like mr biden mr o rourke would appear to satisfy none of these descriptions though his instinct for viral internet ubiquity and generational uplift may amount to its own category his fans compare him to mr obama or the kennedys a font of rangy inspiration rarely dwelling on his record but mr o rourke would enter the race without a signal achievement over six years as an el paso congressman nor an obvious big ticket policy idea that might animate his bid in public settings of late mr o rourke has placed immigration education and especially climate change at the center of his remarks which tend to focus most on a high minded but vague message of uniting a divided nation perhaps mindful of this reputation he has recently unveiled multi point plans on immigration and criminal justice reform both sketch out ideas he has largely outlined before friends say he has cycled through a number of policy passions through the years marijuana legalization advocacy for veterans rural hospital access often prompted by insights from the people he meets it s the time that calls his issues said steve ortega a friend who served on the el paso city council with him mr o rourke spent much of the last two months of 2018 finishing his work in congress condensing his preparation period even more tightly in recent weeks though he has done some of the more typical work of a politician considering a run for president conferring with longtime staff and others who he hopes might join his cause speaking to key groups like a conference of hispanic leaders in chicago and gun control advocates in his hometown headlining a rally to counter mr trump s call for a border wall when the president appeared in el paso but his indecisiveness has compelled some veteran democratic aides who admire him to accept positions with other candidates several people who have spoken to his team came away questioning whether mr o rourke was thoroughly prepared for the crush of a national race some suggested he lacked detailed plans like a comprehensive strategy for amassing delegates mr o rourke and his advisers have however spoken to campaign veterans with experience in managing the delegate process about possibly joining his team according to a person familiar with the discussions unlike other candidates who recruited staff members over the past year with a wink and a nod all but sure that they would enter the race mr o rourke was still conveying uncertainty as recently as last month according to the people who spoke to him since then he has sounded firmer i think he feels his time is now said randi weingarten the president of the american federation of teachers who met with mr o rourke at length recently ms weingarten speaking with mr o rourke and his wife amy in el paso raised the possibility of mr o rourke s challenging senator john cornyn in 2020 texas democrats have prodded him on this score as well but few expect mr o rourke to confine his ambitions to another state level race after prolific success with small dollar donors during the midterms mr o rourke is likely to have little trouble raising enough money to get a presidential run off the ground his presence could energize some crucial voting blocs like young people who formed much of his coalition in texas if he got in it would be a pretty big game changer said eliana locke who leads the college democrats at the university of wisconsin madison where mr o rourke met with students last month supporters also say it is laughable that some liberals particularly allies of mr sanders have described mr o rourke as a squishy moderate because of a congressional record that sometimes veered toward centrism more recently mr o rourke moved well to the left of many 2018 democrats by raising the prospect of impeaching mr trump argued for the destruction of existing border barriers between el paso and mexico and in perhaps his most widely seen social media moment defended the professional football players who were kneeling in protest during the national anthem in texas ted cruz called me a socialist i m too liberal for texas mr o rourke told the students in wisconsin outside of texas people say is he really a democrat i think he s a closet republican i don t know where i am on a spectrum and i almost could care less i just want to get to better things for this country mr ortega the friend from the city council suggested that part of mr o rourke s appeal owes to his self awareness on matters of substance he knows what he doesn t know and is unafraid to concede that a question extends beyond his expertise he s not the kind of guy who s going to give you a made up half baked answer mr ortega said for now supporters would settle for the fully baked answer he is keeping to himself is he in or out updated may 25 2020
