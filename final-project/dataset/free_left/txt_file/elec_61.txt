shane goldmacher and katie glueck may 04 2016 it was only a cruel twist of fate that they were even watching cnn three months ago ted cruz s senior advisers were gathered around the makeshift bar at the iowa state fairgrounds where the texas senator was set to hold what would soon be his iowa caucus victory party they d been informed earlier in the day that the venue wouldn t be able to stream fox news the preferred network of republican events but cnn had offered to hook up its feed advertisement so campaign manager jeff roe chief strategist jason johnson senior adviser david polyansky then communications director rick tyler and others were watching as jake tapper and dana bash broke in with surprising news minutes before the caucuses were set to begin ben carson one of cruz s rivals for the affection of religious republicans wasn t headed straight to new hampshire but florida for some rest very unusual bash said very unusual tapper agreed very significant news added wolf blitzer with their adrenaline pumping in what was expected to be a razor thin race against donald trump cruz s top operatives quickly sprung to action scrambling to tell their vast network of supporters about carson s plans cnn is reporting that ben carson will stop campaigning after iowa make sure to tell all of your peers said the message pushed to users of the cruz mobile app an email read carson is taking time off from the campaign trail it wouldn t have had the impact it did if cnn wasn t on said tyler who was among the cruz aides watching in awe at the televised report which did not mention that their own reporter had also tweeted carson was staying in the race it absolutely wouldn t have happened because we re all staring at the screen saying did you all hear what they said the cruz messages about carson seemed benign enough especially in a rough and tumble 2016 campaign that has seen trump encourage violence at his rallies mimic the disabled on stage and mock his one female rival s physical appearance but carson was deeply aggrieved he would stay in the race through super tuesday dividing the religious right and after he quit carson would continue to hold the iowa messages against the texas senator questioning cruz s ethics and morals he would later endorse trump a man who once suggested carson was a child molester so deep was carson s disdain for cruz for cruz the episode opened the door to questions of trustworthiness that would dog him for the duration and it helped birth one of trump s most damning epithets lyin ted cruz would go on to win iowa that night but the episode with carson fairly or not fueled the characterization of cruz long disseminated by washington republicans that the gentleman from texas was too slick too ambitious too unlikeable to ever be the nominee let alone president but cruz powered by the most organized adept and strategic campaign of the cycle would go on to win hundreds of delegates and nine states he began the race as an afterthought and went on to outlive jeb bush outlast marco rubio and outmaneuver trump at the arcane shadow game of selecting individual delegates who might be loyal he surpassed all expectations for a candidate who few gave much of a chance at the start cruz paired a distilled brand of pure conservatism with an instinct for the depth of anger in the electorate that few others saw he raised millions from small donors and built a big money operation too there was even a brief moment almost exactly four weeks ago in wisconsin when cruz s inner circle truly believed they had a clear path to victory forcing trump into a contested convention and winning on a second or third ballot in his milwaukee victory speech cruz hailed wisconsin as a turning point he was right about that he was wrong about the direction the race was about to turn just when cruz had emerged as trump s sole serious challenger he needed to win over the same republican party insiders he had built his career running against he needed them to rally around him their problem wasn t with cruz s hard line conservative principles it was his hard edged personality and political practices they all had carson stories of their own the idea that there s ever been a spokesperson less equipped to make an argument for party unity i don t think there is anybody said josh holmes who served as senate republican leader mitch mcconnell s chief of staff when cruz arrived in the senate in 2012 getty so many of his congressional colleagues and mainstream republicans stayed on the sidelines some embraced trump others attacked cruz including former speaker john boehner who called him lucifer in the flesh a few endorsed half heartedly they might have feared trump but they loathed cruz one of cruz s few endorsers lindsey graham compared the choice to poison or being shot which one of ted cruz s issues are they out of line with what is it that they re so out of line with asked tyler who resigned as cruz s communications director in february it s petulance and it s petty and it s small it was also damaging just as cruz was about to run into a demographic buzzsaw after constructing his campaign around a conservative base and religious right he launched his bid at the world s largest evangelical university the race in april turned to the more secular northeast cruz would lose not just the next six states but every county in them then on tuesday cruz made his last failed stand in indiana he lost in a landslide it all really happened very suddenly said one cruz source we were on a high after wisconsin fundraising was going great we knew we were going to lose new york and the acela primary not a big surprise but when it happened it just had a different impact the margins of trump s victory hurt us we are all still trying to come to terms with it ourselves from the start cruz s campaign was unusually open about the process and planning that went into running for president the week of his surprise announcement at liberty university he and his team were talking openly about the four lanes in the race tea party libertarian evangelical and establishment cruz they said would compete to consolidate three of them all but the traditional establishment republican lane filled with familiar names like rubio chris christie and bush cruz s goal was simple no one would outflank him on the right on policy and no one would outflank him on anger with the republican elites he succeeded on the former but trump dominated him on the latter that consolidation strategy was borne not just of cruz s political pedigree but also of the 2016 calendar a spate of southern states had jumped the line to vote on march 1 in what became known as the sec primary evangelical rich texas georgia alabama arkansas oklahoma and tennessee would vote that day as campaign manager roe bragged to politico last fall my 19 month old daughter couldn t color a map that s better for us but after cruz carried iowa an ominous warning sign came in south carolina where trump carried what was supposed to be cruz s base winning evangelical voters 33 percent to 27 percent according to exit polling indeed trump s southern success would repeat itself on super tuesday a day cruz himself had once described as his firewall trump collected 254 of the delegates up for grabs that day outpacing cruz s haul of 218 almost half of which came from texas cruz s strategists had constructed their entire campaign to push through the latter half of the calendar with the lead but after super tuesday cruz was running from behind his team launched an alternative plan to deny trump the outright win and take the nomination to a contested convention and for a while it appeared to be working over the course of march and april as trump racked primary win after primary win cruz s data team shifted from targeting voters to identifying state activists who might serve as loyal delegates in cleveland and suddenly cruz looked like he was back on track his team was able to sell the idea that keeping trump from clinching was the gop s last chance to save the party from a celebrity billionaire few would classify as conservative suddenly cruz was winning the race he thought would matter but he was doing something else in turn handing trump a claim many republicans saw as legitimate cruz trump said was trying to snatch the nomination away from the man republican voters clearly preferred but as the 2016 field narrowed it was the lyin ted label that increasing stuck to cruz just as trump s low energy moniker clung mercilessly to bush trump wasn t the first candidate to question cruz s integrity rubio tagged him as calculated and his super pac used the tagline calculated a play on cruz s trusted slogan supporters of mike huckabee attacked cruz in iowa for not tithing even carly fiorina cruz s short lived future running mate said in january of cruz he says whatever he needs to say to get elected but as the 2016 field narrowed it was the lyin ted label that increasingly stuck to cruz just as trump s low energy moniker clung mercilessly to bush and it deeply irked cruz a detail oriented lawyer who parses his words as closely as any politician according to those close to him trump said it dates from the iowa caucus episode with carson i call him lyin ted cruz after what he did to ben carson and many other things trump told sean hannity in late march you know he lies he really lies the fact that cruz had spent months and months praising trump s every move in 2015 only to turn into his harshest critic when it became politically expedient in early 2016 only fed into trump s caricature when it comes to donald trump i like donald trump i think he s terrific i think he s brash i think he speaks the truth cruz had gushed last june i have been glad to praise donald trump cruz boasted last august in september cruz even invited trump to keynote a rally he was organizing at the foot of the capitol last year cruz would chide the press as small minded for their efforts to goad him into criticizing whatever trump s latest outlandish statement was the establishment s only hope trump me in a cage match cruz tweeted in december to diffuse tensions ahead of a debate sorry to disappoint realdonaldtrump is terrific dealwithit but as he feuded with trump in the final three months of the race he blamed the same media he d accused of stoking tensions for now giving trump a free pass he said executives wanted to boost ratings and revenue or that they were secret democrats out to help hillary clinton by the end cruz wasn t just lashing out at the mainstream media as he had from the beginning but some of the key conservative organs of the right hannity fox news and the drudge report to name a few in january cruz had hailed the drudge report as a valuable avenue to bypass media gatekeepers but in april he said drudge was in trump s pocket the drudge report has basically become the attack site for the donald trump campaign still four weeks ago when cruz strode onto the stage at milwaukee s american serb hall many in his campaign believed they were watching the likely republican nominee according to internal polls cruz had come from behind to land a victory in wisconsin that was fueled not only by his traditional conservative base but by a new coalition of women more centrist republicans and young people cruz had been talking for months about conservatives coalescing behind his campaign now it was actually happening my theory was if we can expand this coalition the way we did in wisconsin we can go into the northeastern states it s a trump stronghold we don t have to win but we have to be strong well what a fucking disaster that was his campaign hoped that wisconsin a more diverse blue collar state would offer a blueprint for how cruz could break through as the race headed into rougher territory in the more moderate northeast my theory was if we can expand this coalition the way we did in wisconsin we can go into the northeastern states it s a trump stronghold we don t have to win but we have to be strong said one knowledgeable cruz source well what a fucking disaster that was back before the iowa caucuses cruz s campaign had conceived of a clever line defining trump as a liberal without explicitly attacking him accusing him of new york values it was straight out of roe s old playbook in his missouri days roe had successfully beaten an opponent by hammering her san francisco values it worked in iowa but as the race actually turned to new york three months later the line hung around cruz like an albatross meanwhile the country s most aggressive press corps lay in wait take the f u train ted the cover of the new york daily news greeted him in the liberal northeast cruz began to talk more and more about winning the loyalties of delegates at party conventions and the need to stop trump and less about his conservative agenda somewhere after wisconsin our message became we hate trump everybody hates trump i m going to beat trump and wow we ve got this awesome convention delegate counting thing because we re so good at process the cruz source said that s a problem that s not ted being ted it s just what the story became it seems like we weren t able to do anything about it the wisconsin win the cruz source continued was the biggest day in the campaign we all thought we were going to get it but after the win we started trending down in every state state by state cruz finished third in new york with less than 15 percent of the vote more than 35 percentage points behind trump the margin was devastating state sen michael hough cruz s maryland campaign chair said cruz had had a path to collecting at least some delegates in maryland immediately after wisconsin but after getting blown out in new york all momentum halted for a short time there was some hope we could do something for him hough said but i think the new york thing the media idea that oh it s over i think it swung all the momentum to trump a week after new york cruz would lose not just maryland pennsylvania rhode island delaware and connecticut but every county and congressional district in those states the only state cruz would win delegates in was rhode island he never campaigned there cruz s inner circle gathered this monday it was not a conversation his team had expected to have just weeks after winning big in wisconsin but the day before the indiana primary there they were gathered in the seventh floor offices of cruz s houston headquarters discussing the senator s suddenly shaky future it was the first time there was any discussion about it in that senior staff meeting which happened every monday said someone close to the campaign the polls continued to show we weren t going to do well in indiana that s where things were going then the question became ok what happened what do you do next it was really after the losses of last week the magnitude of the trump victories the fact that he broke 50 percent 60 percent said another cruz source involved it destroyed our narrative that there s a ceiling to his support chad sweet cruz s campaign chairman and an old friend was adamant in the monday meeting that the senator would stay in regardless of indiana according to two sources but not everyone agreed the discussion stretched beyond 2016 to cruz s senate seat and his political future still cruz had 9 million in the bank after all and some of his allies saw no downside to staying in as long as trump didn t have the needed delegates getty but by the time polls opened in indiana cruz had already pulled every political stunt he could to blunt trump s momentum he d struck a pact with john kasich to pull out of indiana in exchange for cruz abandoning two later states and he d named his vice presidential pick fiorina less than 24 hours after he had been mathematically eliminated from winning the republican nomination it was a blatant play to draw attention it didn t work the new york times didn t even devote a separate story to the announcement for the printed edition instead pairing it with bernie sanders cutting back his staff failing hopefuls regroup to save their campaigns read the headline cruz did get a spike on social media but it didn t last the next day boehner calling him lucifer and a miserable son of a bitch drowned out fiorina with 82 428 mentions of cruz and boehner compared with 66 434 for cruz and fiorina according to zignal labs which tracks digital conversation tyler said the cruz campaign had been in a bind doing nothing would have been dumb he said doing something was smart and so it was a smart move but in terms of the timing sometimes you don t have a choice you know what s going to happen but you have to do it anyway cruz allies bristled toward the end that the so called never trump movement never fully embraced him and that those who did did so too late some in the campaign blamed kasich s refusal to drop out for preventing a unification around cruz he clearly hurt us said a source close to the campaign but cruz s lack of relationships loomed large we all know that ted cruz is hated by every human being in washington that draws breath said rick wilson a republican strategist who has worked in opposition to trump ted not having a lot of friends in d c it adds ups ultimately there was nothing left to try cruz woke up on the morning of the indiana primary to rain and the news that trump was touting a national enquirer story that claimed without evidence that his father was involved in john f kennedy s assassination the day would only get worse history dept by josh zeitz letter from indiana by adam wren fourth estate by jack shafer in a heated news conference the usually measured cruz unleashed he called trump amoral and a serial philanderer leveling the kinds of accusations that he had proudly avoided for the entirety of the campaign and he aimed once again to push back on the lyin ted moniker with which trump had so effectively tagged him this man is a pathological liar he doesn t know the difference between truth and lies cruz said in a pattern that is straight out of a psychology text book he accuses everyone of lying cruz suffered indignity after indignity in the lead up to the indiana primary from a squalling child protester whom he found himself scolding to his would be running mate falling off a stage in a video that went viral in political circles and on monday in another video that dominated the day cruz engaged with trump protesters one of whom took to simply yelling lyin ted as the senator sought to make his points cruz had had enough he made the final call tuesday in a meeting with roe his campaign manager and johnson his chief strategist some staffers had already been bracing for the news after being told to fly to indianapolis from houston on tuesday many were informed by texts from roe thanking them for their hard work less than an hour before cruz made the announcement official in a sign of the tight ship roe ran the news did not leak out until roe himself walked over to a small group of reporters at the watch party minutes before cruz took the stage and gave the texas tribune reporter the go ahead to tweet the development fiorina was still speaking on stage after not even a week on the ticket the televisions at the rally had been switched off shortly before she took the stage cnn had been playing correction an earlier version of this
