to decide whether we all will work together so we all can rise together mrs clinton radiated confidence from her pungent delivery and easy laugh to the unusually expressive ways she shifted her tone and delighted in her own best lines she smoothly acknowledged her own limitations and trust issues as a public figure and forcefully challenged mr trump over his claims that he alone could fix america s problems and after 25 years in a sometimes brutal national spotlight mrs clinton tried to explain who she is and what drives her from her methodist faith to her passion for government policy that could mean all the difference for people transcript na i sweat the details of policy mrs clinton said because it s not just a detail if it s your kid if it s your family it s a big deal and it should be a big deal to your president it was one of several contrasts she drew with mr trump who has barely explained how he would carry out his policy goals and she received help from several republicans

generations of women the two locked eyes and fell into a long embrace as mrs clinton patted her back a moment later mrs clinton waved at mr clinton and he blew her a kiss then mrs clinton who has given only a few major political speeches in her life delivered her biggest yet she offered a positive portrait of america that felt like a different country than the nation in decline that mr trump often describes and that many voters fear has come to pass after years of terrorism at home and abroad and the growing gap between rich and poor he s betting that the perils of today s world will blind us to its unlimited promise mrs clinton said he wants us to fear the future and fear each other well a great democratic president franklin delano roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to

conventions look like in the future will women be even more visible will it be unacceptable to have a ticket that doesn t include a woman that s what i wonder about end mrs clinton facing a three month general election campaign against an unpredictable mr trump who has risen in the polls since his convention speech last week hoped that her remarks here would not only energize her party but also help her connect with undecided and independent voters who are skeptical of her candidacy she nodded toward the political work she still had to do praising her rival for the democratic nomination senator bernie sanders of vermont she told his mostly liberal supporters some of whom booed or staged a silent protest in the hall declining to applaud her speech i want you to know i ve heard you

the truth is through all these years of public service the service part has always come easier to me than the public part mrs clinton said i get it that some people just don t know what to make of me she added before sharing memories of her humble roots and life lessons from church and her mother particularly no one gets through life alone her strategy was to go hard at mr trump repeatedly drawing contrasts between her positions which are in the mainstream of democratic politics and mr trump s unorthodox views for a republican such as placing tariffs on other nations goods and possibly withdrawing from treaties and trade deals reciting a litany of unusual and unlikely ideas that mr trump laid out at the republican convention mrs clinton drew huge laugh when she said he spoke for 70 odd minutes and i do mean odd milestones in politics when women and minorities were first elected to federal state and local government mrs clinton the rare first lady who like her idol eleanor roosevelt used the job to influence policy and who went on to be a powerful figure began her own quest for the white house nearly a decade ago with her first run for the nomination against barack obama back then she presented herself as a steely and even hawkish democrat who held some views opposing gay marriage supporting free trade and championing the rights of gun owners that she has shifted since her defeat this time around she fashioned herself as a progressive who likes to get things done the sort of line straddling language that makes some liberals dubious of her values and some independents skeptical about her authenticity her convention speech comes 47 years after the young hillary rodham wound up in life magazine when she used her commencement address at wellesley college to reckon with that era s civic unrest and clashes between protesters and police officers a visual analysis of the presidential and vice presidential convention speeches her message to the millions of people watching her speech on television thursday night was similar as she implored americans to look past fear and tumult and to choose harmony over hatred but this time mrs clinton was to speak to an audience that is deeply distrustful of her some 67 percent of all voters and 74 percent of independents said they do not trust mrs clinton in the latest new york times cbs news poll about six weeks ago mrs clinton started sketching down rough notes about what she wanted to say on the eve she accepts her party s nomination a month ago discussions with her top policy adviser jake sullivan and the speechwriters dan schwerin and megan rooney began to shape the speech with advice from a variety of friends and former speechwriters mrs clinton also sought advice from mr obama s much admired former director of speechwriting jon favreau the speech often electrified the assembled democrats with its crowd pleasing lines about mr trump like imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons and the delegates reveled at the end as confetti rained down on mrs clinton and she playfully swatted at the spill of balloons for her though the greatest exhilaration flowed from the sense that history had been made and that the lives of future generations would be changed forever standing here as my mother s daughter and my daughter s mother i m so happy this day has come mrs clinton said happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between happy for boys and men too because when any barrier falls in america for anyone it clears the way for everyone when there are no ceilings the sky s the limit so let s keep going she said until every one of the 161 million women and girls across america has the opportunity she deserves advertisement
