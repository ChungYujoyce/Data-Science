for all of his bluster about the strength of the economy and his purported role in guiding the country to new highs president trump is worried as the washington post reported on thursday trump is increasingly concerned about the various flashing lights indicating that the economy may be in trouble his team is cobbling together options aimed at offsetting the worst possibilities but one of trump s past decisions is widely cited as prompting the current instability the trade war with china on friday morning trump unveiled a tactic in the ongoing fight with the world s most populous country the vast amounts of money made and stolen by china from the united states year after year for decades will and must stop he wrote on twitter our great american companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to china including bringing your companies home and making your products in the usa i will be responding to china s tariffs this afternoon this is a great opportunity for the united states it s been a staple of trump s rhetoric for some time that he will entice companies to bring manufacturing back to the united states on the campaign trail in 2016 he would regularly tell audiences that he would make pariahs of companies that manufacture overseas friday s tweets though do something different first they aim futilely to be precisely the sort of government control of the private sector that has been a focus of trump s most fervent recent criticism albeit in the abstract second it is a demand in short that businesses shift more of the brunt of the trade war onto american consumers a group which trump has claimed would be shielded from the economic fight the first point is fairly self explanatory with the 2020 election looming trump has decided to focus on the alleged socialism of his political opponents a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism trump said at a campaign rally in new hampshire last week and the destruction the destruction of the american dream trump s colloquial use of socialism means essentially government social welfare programs that cost money and don t benefit his base a july yougov poll found that republicans were more likely to see proposals such as free college education or universal health care as socialism but less likely to apply that term to things such as medicare or social security in reality socialism is an economic system in which the public generally meaning the government controls production which gallup found last year republicans are more likely to understand than democrats in other words a socialist system is one in which say an elected leader representing the public instructs how production should occur by hereby ordering them to only produce in the united states for example trump s not a socialist of course he s mostly just angry that a trade war he once described as easy to win is not so easy to win after all for decades he was the ceo of the trump organization and could order his people to do things as president that instinct clearly remains even if that power doesn t even if trump did have the ability to force business to bring production back to the united states or onshore as they say there would be negative repercussions beyond just political hypocrisy in may the post spoke with columbia university s david weinstein one of the authors of a research paper evaluating the costs to consumers of trump s tariffs he explained that the costs came in two forms the first is that imported products subject to new tariffs necessarily get more expensive since the government is now applying an additional tax to get them to consumers some of that cost will be absorbed by the companies exporting and importing the products but some will be passed on to consumers the other form is that companies which use china as a source for components will look to other countries that aren t affected by tariffs let s say for example that a clothing manufacturer pays 10 per component to import from china instead of paying 11 to import from vietnam with a 25 percent tariff applied to the chinese component sourcing each item from china jumps to 12 50 it s cheaper to get the product from vietnam though it s still 1 more expensive than it used to be what s more there are additional costs to the company from switching figuring out supply chains shipping legal issues and so on in june a national retail federation report explained how tricky shifting a supply chain could be it reads in part weinstein s research suggested that trump s original tariffs cost american consumers 3 billion a month in direct tariffs and another 1 4 billion from the costs of shifting supply chains when trump expanded the tariffs it made re sourcing products a relatively cheaper option as a result fewer products would be imported reducing that monthly total but supply chain costs would increase to 6 6 billion a month those are costs of the trade war paid by consumers despite what trump said at that same new hampshire rally we re taking in billions of dollars in tariffs and again china s devaluing their currency they re pouring out money he claimed the prices haven t gone up so that means we re taking in billions of dollars we re not paying for it demanding that manufacturers rejigger their supply chains means increased prices apart from the prices that have gone up because of tariffs trump has no power to make such a demand of course his tweet ordering companies to produce goods using non chinese suppliers not only lack legal weight they essentially lack any weight whatsoever good news for trump given his views on socialism receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in
