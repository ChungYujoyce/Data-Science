american city i used to live and work there and have been a frequent visitor since i became china s ambassador to the united states as covid 19 continues to sweep across the world it is sad to see the bustling sleepless metropolis put on hold what we are experiencing is a challenge of such magnitude that nationality and ethnicity should be irrelevant china was hit hard by the pandemic not long ago so its people can empathize with americans suffering now we made huge sacrifices to push back the virus we know how tough the battle is and will continue to be here and across the world we will always remember that in our most difficult days our friends in so many places many of them americans many of them new yorkers offered us a helping hand we stand ready now to repay their kindness and help them make it through too let s acknowledge there has been unpleasant talk between our nations about this disease but this is not the time for finger pointing this is a time for solidarity collaboration and mutual support that is why over 100 chinese public health experts have traveled abroad to save lives that is why we are sending test kits protective masks and medical equipment to overrun hospitals in the united states and many other countries that is why we are sharing expertise and hard learned lessons with countries seeking information and answers in his recent phone call with president trump president xi jinping of china stressed the importance of solidarity between our two countries and promised to provide assistance to the best of our capability china has been providing updates about the disease in a responsible manner including setting up an online covid 19 knowledge center that s available to all countries chinese and american health authorities and experts have stayed in close communication to share knowledge and experience china is doing whatever it can to support the united states and other countries in need new york america s epicenter of the pandemic is one of the biggest destinations of china s assistance we are facilitating the u s government s purchase of personal protective equipment made in china indeed factories are operating in full swing to fulfill the orders of medical supplies from new york state and other parts of america china s provincial and city governments are rushing to help their sister states and cities in

america are also showing their support with generous financial and material donations to their local hospitals and neighborhoods in the fight against the virus we stand together with the people of new york and america at a time when solidarity is essential we need to keep cool heads and clearly say no to the folly of fanning racism and xenophobia and to scapegoating other countries or races such acrimony will not only undercut cooperation between our nations but also sow seeds of suspicion and confrontation that could put our peoples and even the world in grave danger from this runaway virus and the economic fallout it is causing as the two biggest economies in the world china and the united states need to lead international efforts in collaborative research into treatments and vaccines and explore the sharing of pharmaceutical technologies among nations we need to help countries with underdeveloped medical systems and contribute to better global health governance we must also enhance our coordination of macroeconomic policy to stabilize markets ensure growth and people s livelihoods and keep the global industrial and supply chains open stable and secure this was the core message delivered by president xi during the virtual group of 20 summit on covid 19 late last month it is also an integral part of the notion that countries belong to a global community with a shared future i don t doubt for a moment that new york will survive this crisis i recently read that new yorkers have taken to clapping from their balconies and windows for the health care workers who are battling on the front lines against the pandemic i am deeply moved by such scenes of solidarity for they speak to people s love and courage and to the city s enduring strength they are a ray of hope in this dark time of hardship i look forward to my next trip to new york when i will once again roam its vibrant avenues my eyes open for fresh signs of resilience and resolve i also plan to see the broadway production of the lion king a show about love courage and hope i believe this day is not too far away cui tiankai is the chinese ambassador to the united states the times is committed to
