sunday night s democratic debate was dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz insisted timed to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates given that it was held on the sunday before a federal holiday that seems dubious but whoever wasn t deterred by the debate s inauspicious timing saw an event that was both substantive and sort of lackadaisical almost all the discussion focused on policy but bernie sanders and hillary clinton began awkwardly attempting to slip in attacks on each other though neither really seemed that comfortable doing it the most animated of the bunch was martin o malley who seemed energized by his quest to successfully say something anything without being talked over it ll take a few days for poll results to trickle in which will provide the closest thing to an objective answer of who actually won the debate but in the meantime here are the candidates who ended the night better off than they started it and the ones who slipped bernie is now posting his best poll numbers of the campaign to date as he excitedly pointed out in a moment that echoed donald trump s matter of fact citation of polling at thursday s republican debate he s only 4 points behind in iowa and gaining solidly ahead in new hampshire and has momentum nationally too there s a very real possibility that he wins the first two primary contests and leaves clinton scrambling to recover in south carolina what sanders needed to do sunday night was maintain that momentum continue his appeal to liberal base voters and blunt any attacks that clinton might be tempted to unleash at him he accomplished all of that even if he didn t give a focused dominant performance his release of his single payer financing details denied clinton a major attack line he avoided getting bogged down in guns clearlyhis worst issue from the democratic base s perspective and he struck an ecumenical tone that made him seem relatively above the fray as clinton tried out various critiques targeting him perhaps his strongest moment was when he erupted at andrea mitchell after being asked about bill clinton s affairs andrea mitchell senator sanders let me ask you a question you called bill clinton s past transgressions quote totally totally totally disgraceful and unacceptable senator do you regret saying that bernie sanders i was asked a question you know one of the things andrea that question annoys me i cannot walk down the street secretary clinton knows that without being told how much i have to attack secretary clinton to get me on the front page of the paper i have to make a vicious attack i have avoided doing that i m trying to run an issue oriented campaign applause i was asked a question andrea mitchell you didn t have to answer it that way though why did you bernie sanders then if i don t there s another front page yes and i mean this seriously we ve been through this yes his behavior was deplorable have i said a word no i have not i m going to debate secretary clinton governor o malley on the issues facing the american people not bill clinton s personal behavior this appeals to older democrats still pissed at the media s preoccupation with bill s sexual misconduct while still reminding people of it and condemning it as deplorable it makes him seem above such frivolity and interested in waging a positive issue oriented campaign best of all clinton didn t get a chance to respond even though her campaign attacked sanders this week for appearing to go negative in one tv spot after a debate when she clearly went negative at sanders and a week in which a notable surrogate attacked him not on the issues but for his age this made clinton seem threatened by sanders and desperate to attack him as he brushed off the attacks and pivoted to the issues oh yeah and this is the first debate in which bernie got the most speaking time of any candidate beating clinton by two and a half minutes it was only eight years ago that hillary clinton was repeatedly attacking barack obama as a dangerously inexperienced naif who would be unable to get anything of consequence done as president now she presents herself as a defender of his sundry accomplishments and attacks sanders for being insufficiently supportive of the president the fact is we have the affordable care act clinton declared that is one of the greatest accomplishments of president obama of the democratic party and of our country and we have already seen 19 million americans get insurance she also cited sanders s past criticisms of the president and flirtation with supporting a primary challenge against him in 2011 12 he s criticized president obama for taking donations from wall street and president obama has led our country out of the great recession senator sanders called him weak disappointing he even in 2011 publicly sought someone to run in a primary against president obama now i personally believe that president obama s work to push through the dodd frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we ve had since the 1930s so i m going to defend dodd frank and i m going to defend president obama for taking on wall street taking on the financial industry and getting results clinton s message is clear i am the true defender of obama s legacy i will preserve his gains while sanders dismissed them sanders replied not by defending his past critiques of obama but by distancing himself from them and insisting he s a huge fan of the president in 2006 when i ran for the senate senator barack obama was kind enough to campaign for me 2008 i did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012 i worked as hard as i could to see that he was re elected he and i are friends we ve worked together we have differences of opinion as for clinton s claims that he would threaten the affordable care act he rebutted we re not going to tear up the affordable care act i helped write it sanders isn t disavowing obama s legacy at all he s embracing it and selling himself as the natural person to build on it o malley made the same point in his introduction declaring we need to come together as a people and build on the good things that president obama has done the democratic primary then is a competition among three people all of whom embrace obama s legacy celebrate it as a huge success and differ only on the matter of who s best equipped to defend and expand his accomplishments no matter who wins that this is the debate goes to show just how beloved obama remains within the democratic party and how he and his presidency will continue to define the party s mission for years after he s left office sanders s spat with mitchell aside the moderating sunday night was about as strong as it s been at any debate for either party this entire cycle mitchell and lester holt held the line against candidates talking over each other and speaking past their time limits and holt especially was willing to ask follow up questions when candidates were evasive when sanders avoided a question about why he flip flopped aboutlawsuit immunity for gun companies holt pressed him senator you didn t answer the question that you did change your position on immunity for gun manufacturers can you answer the question as to why lester holt apparently going to try this new fangled follow up question missing from the last gop debate similarly when sanders positioned himself as tougher on wall street than clinton holt didn t just ask clinton to reply he framed the reply to ensure it was more useful to viewers secretary clinton help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here most importantly almost all of their questions were substantive policy oriented and designed to not be answerable simply by reference to candidates past statements sanders may have largely dodged mitchell s question about how he accounts for the failure of single payer in vermont despite mitchell s great efforts to force him to answer it but it was a perfect angle it doesn t get sanders to regurgitate his stump speech but it forces him to engage with the actual implementation challenges his medicare for all proposal faces moderating is hard lester holt makes it look easy prepared strong folos no snark knows when to let the candidates talk demdebate holt and mitchell served as a reminder of what engaged moderating meant to inform viewers rather than provoke conflict or appease campaigns through lax timing rules looks like future moderators would do well to follow the example they set at the risk of sounding tautological clinton lost by not winning the trends aren t in her favor at the moment sanders is gaining in iowa and is starting to be treated like a serious candidate by the press her attempts to attack sanders s support for single payer health care this week were widely perceived as backfiring especially among liberal primary voters who might be tempted to support clinton out of practicality she needed a debate in which she could show that sanders was out of his depth not someone you could plausibly see actually functioning as president she didn t do that this time around instead she had a debate where she tried to throw everything she could at him to see what stuck she tried the single payer attack but given that bernie released his plan before the debate it sounded more convoluted than effective i have to say i m not sure whether we re talking about the plan you just introduced tonight or we re talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the congress ouch she tried attacking sanders as insufficiently pro obama largely for reasons related to wall street reform which generally didn t sound that persuasive hearing that obama took wall street money isn t likely to make primary voters think hmm a guy i like took money from bankers clearly i should vote for hillary clinton who also takes money from bankers it just raises the visibility of the fact that hillary clinton gets finance money and sanders doesn t which on the margins is going to bring a lot more people to sanders s column than to clinton s her gun attack was pointed and strong raising all of sanders s key failings in quick succession he voted against the brady bill five times he voted for what we call the charleston loophole he voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the nra said was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years he voted to let guns go onto the amtrak guns go into national parks he voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives let s not forget what this is about 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country that s 33 000 people a year it was probably the best hit she got against sanders in the whole debate poor guy the former maryland governor began his remarks with my name is martin o malley a cringe worthy reminder that many primary voters don t even know who he is or that he s running for president and he didn t get a lot of opportunities to change that situation throughout the evening take a look at the speaking time chart again even o malley s protests that he wasn t being heard wound up getting ignored lester holt we re going to get into all that coming up martin o malley lester just 10 seconds lester holt but we re going to take a break and we need to take a break martin o malley just 10 seconds all of the things lester holt and when we come back the anger brewing in america martin o malley literally asked for the ability to speak for 10 seconds and lester holt answered him no by then end of the debate you could see sheer shock and gratitude on his face when it came to closing statements before we leave is there anything you wanted to say tonight that you haven t gotten a chance to say and we ll start with gov o malley holt said didn t see that coming did you there s actually a strong case for o malley over sanders and clinton as a hyper competent governor with solid liberal credentials and a record of accomplishment that s not a case that o malley was able to present sunday night get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
