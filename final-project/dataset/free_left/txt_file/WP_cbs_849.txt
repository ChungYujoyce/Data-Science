the following is a transcript of an interview with former secretary of state john kerry that aired sunday january 12 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan we go now to dubuque iowa and the presidential campaign trail where former secretary of state john kerry is on a campaign bus trip with former vice president joe biden and you can hear that bus generator going in the background good morning to you mr secretary former secretary of state john kerry sorry about that good morning margaret good to be with you margaret brennan i want to pick up kind of where we just left off with the two senators you know you ve been touting joe biden s foreign policy experience as a reason voters should consider voting for him bernie sanders his opponent has has taken that on as a reason essentially not to specifically focusing in on biden s vote to help authorize the war in iraq he called it appalling that after 18 years joe biden still refuses to admit he was dead wrong in the iraq war the worst foreign policy blunder in modern american history given what you know about the region and how iran was essentially empowered by that why why doesn t he just call it a mistake kerry well i think i in fact margaret i think that bernie regrettably is distorting joe s record in the following sense i mean he doesn t have what joe biden has which is eight years of sitting on the national security council and demonstrating his judgment whether it was on his leadership dealing with the migration that was flowing across our border and helping to resolve that with the presidents of those countries or his work pulling troops out of iraq and negotiating that and working as perhaps the lead point man on that effort i think that that i know very well what joe s position was because i answered those questions back in 2002 2000 2003 and four and it was very clear that what we were doing was listening to a president who made a pledge that he was going to do diplomacy that he was going to exhaust diplomacy build a coalition and ultimately we learned as joe did and i did that the intelligence was distorted so joe spoke out and criticized joe was against what they were doing the vote was not a vote specifically to go to war it was a vote for the president to have leverage with respect to getting saddam hussein back to the negotiating table back to the inspections excuse me and i think we were let down and joe has said many times that it was a mistake obviously you trust the words of the administration who didn t follow through on what they said they were going to do and i invite you to go back read my speech on the floor and others margaret brennan right kerry where i said this is not a vote specifically to let the president go to war so i think bernie is trying to drive a wedge in there i understand that but i think the vice president has unparalleled demonstrated accomplishment and success in foreign policy as chairman of the foreign relations committee and as vice president and he in my judgment is the one person running for president margaret brennan yeah kerry who the moment he takes office has the ability to be able to address a lot of questions including the credibility of the united states margaret brennan well kerry joe has told the truth people know that and i think they will trust in his capacity to lead the country at a very very delicate time margaret brennan well kerry when foreign policy experience margaret brennan it is kerry is in fact a premium margaret brennan it is and iran an issue you know well is front and center right now but virtually every single democrat running for office right now is claiming the same or virtually the same iran policy which is to try to revive the deal that you negotiated there s some would say a shell of it left now shouldn t voters expect more out of a iran strategy from someone trying to be commander in chief kerry well joe biden is in fact providing more which is to recognize that that it s not enough just to go back to where we were because obviously circumstances have changed and things have evolved in the last three and a half years and and what what vice president biden knows we have to do is make sure now that all the things that we were going to do in the follow on agreement which was always contemplated margaret you were there you re an expert at this you know exactly what the truth is about it we were trying to take the nuclear weapon off the table first and then negotiate yemen hezbollah threats against israel the regional question of trafficking of arms and and so vice president biden understands that now has to also be front and center margaret brennan yeah kerry as you as you revive the agreement but the truth is france germany margaret brennan right kerry britain china russia are all still trying to keep the agreement in place because they recognize it s the strongest most transparent most accountable nuclear agreement on the planet margaret brennan well kerry and it did take a nuclear weapon off the table until president trump decided unilaterally to ignore all of our allies and move to get out of the agreement margaret brennan well the president kerry and everything margaret brennan the president s going on the kerry that s happened in the last days margaret brennan going on the attack on that deal this morning specifically mentioning you perhaps not a surprise but you know i i know the deal you negotiated lifted sanctions gave some relief in exchange for capping the nuclear program there was also a parallel negotiation that released some cash as part of a settlement of a different separate dispute the president this week put blame on the administration your the administration you served on with essentially helping to provide money to the irgc i want to play a sound bite of what you said in 2016 to cnbc when you were asked about how iran would spend the money begin clip kerry i think that some of it will end up in the hands of the irgc or of other entities some of which are labeled terrorist you know to some degree i m i m not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that can be prevented but i can tell you this right now we are not seeing the early delivery of funds going to that kind of endeavor at this point in time i m sure at some point some of it will end clip margaret brennan i remember talking to you at the time money is fungible kerry sure margaret brennan why though did you think kerry absolutely money is fungible margaret brennan that that was a risk worth taking if you knew the possibility of what would happen with that money kerry well what i was really saying i think first of all margaret you are an expert at this you were there you know that the president s tweet is a lie and the president tweeted this morning because i am coming on the show and he knew you d ask me the question or he d push you in a place where you did ask the question you and the media i think need to call a lie a lie you know margaret brennan mr secretary i asked you that question in 2015 too kerry they didn t get 150 billion dollars no no no but let me just finish you know yes and i ll i ll answer that i was saying clearly some money from the budget of iran is going to go to the irgc it always has that s no surprise but the truth is and president trump i i well he probably doesn t know this but the fact is his own defense intelligence agency in 2017 testified to the congress that very very little money actually went to the irgc at all most of the money went to the economy of iran which is precisely what i said and what we all said so the irgc has never had a problem getting money margaret but the fact is donald trump keeps saying they got 150 billion dollars a lie he keeps saying that all of that money went to pay for it it did not his own defense intelligence agency says most of the money went for the economy of the country so you know we have to stop dealing with questions on donald trump s lies and start dealing with the reality of what is going on the fact is margaret brennan okay kerry that mo the vast proportion of that money margaret brennan yeah kerry went to the economy of iran and they re always going to be funding the irgc there was no question about that margaret brennan right kerry and the irgc budget has not gone up markedly as a result margaret brennan okay kerry of what happened with the agreement period margaret brennan mr secretary thank you for joining us i want to take a break because we have a report from iran watch cbs news
