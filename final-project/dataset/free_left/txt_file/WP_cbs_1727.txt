a shower he d wash his clothes in lysol disinfectant they did a tremendous amount of handwashing but at providence saint john s health center in santa monica california gulick and his colleagues worried that caring for infected patients without first being able to don an n95 respirator mask was risky the n95 mask filters out 95 of all airborne particles including ones too tiny to be blocked by regular masks but administrators at his hospital said they weren t necessary and didn t provide them he said his wife also a nurse not only wore an n95 mask but covered it with a second air purifying respirator while she cared for covid 19 patients at cedars sinai medical center across town in los angeles then last week a nurse on gulick s ward tested positive for the coronavirus which causes the disease covid 19 the next day doctors doing rounds on their ward asked the nurses why they weren t wearing n95 masks gulick said and told them they should have better protection for gulick that was it he and a handful of nurses told their managers they wouldn t enter covid 19 patient rooms without n95 masks the hospital suspended them according to the national nurses union which represents them ten nurses are now being paid but not allowed to return to work pending an investigation from human resources the union said they are among hundreds of doctors nurses and other health care workers across the country who say they ve been asked to work without adequate protection some have taken part in protests or lodged formal complaints others are buying or even making their own supplies guidelines from the centers for disease control and prevention don t require n95 masks for covid 19 caregivers but many hospitals are opting for the added protection because the infection has proven to be extremely contagious the cdc said wednesday at least 9 200 health care workers have been infected saint john s said in a statement that as of tuesday it was providing n95 masks to all nurses caring for covid 19 patients and those awaiting test results the statement said the hospital had increased its supply and was disinfecting masks daily it s no secret there is a national
