advertisement supported by by patrick healy no moment in the 2016 presidential campaign has cried out more for a unifying candidate than the police shootings of two black men last week and the ensuing national uproar followed by the shocking sniper ambush that killed five police officers in dallas and no other moment has revealed more starkly how hard it is for donald j trump and hillary clinton to become that candidate never have two presidential nominees been as unpopular as mr trump and mrs clinton and they are not fully trusted by their own parties nor showing significant crossover appeal in the polls mr trump the self described champion of law and order is also the political figure many people blame for sowing division and hatred with his attacks on illegal immigrants muslims mexicans and others rather than defuse tension he electrifies crowds and vanquishes rivals through provocations that he delights in calling politically incorrect of the two mrs clinton would seem more able and driven to try to bring the country together she has a large following among black voters and speaks ardently about the need for respect and love and kindness after dallas she called on white people to understand how african americans feel every day yet many on the right and some on the left dislike her intensely and even her admirers say she lacks the public emotion oratorical skills and reputation for honesty to persuade large numbers of americans to see things her way the need for a reassuring and healing voice has come at a particularly bad time for the two presumptive presidential nominees for many americans mrs clinton s credibility was further damaged last week as the f b i director james b comey sharply criticized her for being extremely careless about her use of private email as secretary of state at the same time mr trump alienated many voters with his mixed comments about saddam hussein and his defensiveness over a twitter post that many people regarded as anti semitic trump is 100 percent saying the right things about police and respecting authority but then he says these other comments that are too weird for voters to ignore said fred l deluca a trump supporter and former police officer who owns a graphic supply store in youngstown ohio and hillary i don t trust what she says about law enforcement not at all traumatic events have at times become opportunities for presidential candidates to step up and grow in the eyes of the american public such as when bill clinton went to los angeles in 1992 in the aftermath of the riots there or when barack obama pushed for aggressive bipartisan action from the federal government to stem the banking crisis and protect taxpayers mr clinton s new generation image and empathic personality appealed across party lines as did mr obama s historic candidacy and in moments of national crisis presidents have shown ability to unify the country if fleetingly like george w bush did after the sept 11 2001 attacks these candidates did not have to sell themselves to voters against such an intense combination of terrorism mass shootings police and gun violence social unease and free floating fear still the current run of crises has in the view of many democrats and republicans served only to spotlight the shortcomings of both mr trump and mrs clinton the sense of alienation and estrangement is so great today that it s hard to unite people and these candidates haven t done it said the rev jesse jackson a clinton backer the historian doris kearns goodwin compared the current political climate to the civil war era and recalled lincoln s house divided speech during his 1858 senate campaign in which he analyzed the deep divisions between the north and the south and predicted that the country would become more united but first slavery had to be eliminated or made the law of the land she said lincoln proved to be a president who would go to war to unify the country and credited president lyndon b johnson and the rev dr martin luther king jr with mobilizing forces around the country and in congress in the 1960s to pass civil rights legislation that while highly divisive also brought greater equality for americans if trump was a more disciplined focused candidate this could be his moment to win over americans because the desire for a strong leader is great in moments of turbulence she said but look at his record after brexit he talked about the weak currency helping his golf course after the orlando shootings it was i told you so after the f b i report on hillary he couldn t focus on that voters want candidates to show we can trust them and both candidates have this problem get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between hillary clinton and donald j trump in several recent polls roughly two thirds of americans said that mrs clinton was not honest and trustworthy mr trump drew similar numbers on the question these polls were conducted before the f b i director rebuked mrs clinton over her private email and handling of classified material mr trump whose poll ratings grew after his forceful responses to terrorist attacks in paris and san bernardino calif tried to sound similarly resolute on friday evening saying in a video that law enforcement was the force between civilization and total chaos and he said now is the time for prayers love unity and leadership these remarks were relatively restrained for him and his advisers hope that he can build on his image as a powerful no nonsense executive and attempt to unify voters he is the choice of most voters who say they are particularly interested in electing a strong leader a little over one quarter of the electorate according to a recent bloomberg politics survey a gallup poll conducted in may showed that six in 10 americans consider him a strong and decisive leader vernita blocker a retired social work administrator from lindenwold n j supports mrs clinton but said she worried that mr trump might be better suited to capitalize on americans concerns about fraying social order the more people are afraid the more it plays into trump s hands because they will want a strongman type president ms blocker said hillary has to find more ways to persuade people that she could really unite the country despite all the people who don t like her yet mr trump is still having trouble uniting his own party while mrs clinton appears further along with democrats the conventions this month will be huge opportunities for the nominees to galvanize the faithful but also a chance to reach out to the other side with traditionally positive speeches about their hopes for the country on policy mrs clinton is also eager to find common ground on gun control and criminal justice reform issues that resonate with many voters at a time of seemingly endless violence while new gun laws are opposed by many on the right she wants americans to at least talk about finding solutions if not uniting behind them i think unity is the wrong goal and what we need can t be achieved by lofty oratory alone said wendy l wall an associate professor of history at binghamton university often in our past unity has meant burying disagreements rather than solving common problems what we need now is someone who can work across differences not erase them i think there is no way trump could do this she added i think the jury is still out on clinton advertisement
