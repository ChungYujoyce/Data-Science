by william saletan two years ago in the early days of the russia investigation many republican senators said collusion with a foreign government to influence an american election would be a betrayal of the united states they didn t believe donald trump had solicited campaign help from russia but they agreed that if he had it was illegal and perhaps impeachable today some of those senators notably the committee chairmen responsible for protecting national security and the rule of law have renounced that principle they now assert in the case of ukraine that collusion is ok sen james risch of idaho is the chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations in june 2017 he interrogated then attorney general jeff sessions at a hearing of the senate select committee on intelligence collusion with the russians or any other government for that matter when it comes to our elections certainly would be improper and illegal risch stipulated he asked sessions would that be a fair statement sessions replied absolutely sen lindsey graham of south carolina expressed a similar view at a press conference earlier this year graham who is now the chairman of the judiciary committee explained the big thing for me guys has always been did trump work with the russians and i told him to his face almost two years ago if you did that s it between me and you and anything that follows you deserve i will say that about any politician of any party sen ron johnson the chairman of the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs espoused the same rule the pivotal question the wisconsin senator insisted was whether members of the trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government the united states should be investigating was there collusion said johnson in april nbc s andrea mitchell asked the senator whether he agreed with trump s lawyer rudy giuliani that it s ok for republican campaign members for republican candidates to welcome support from a foreign adversary from russia do you feel the same way would you welcome support from russia in your campaign johnson replied decisively no slate s sharpest takes curated and distilled by slate s copy

ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky that his country besieged and partially occupied by russia depended on u s military aid we do a lot for ukraine said trump he complained that ukraine wasn t providing reciprocal help and he asked zelensky for a favor to work with giuliani and u s attorney general william barr on two investigations that could help trump in 2020 trump explicitly named former u s vice president joe biden who was at that point the democrat most likely to face trump in the general election there s a lot of talk about biden s son that biden stopped the prosecution of him said trump a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it the phone call was open and shut collusion trump had asked a foreign government to investigate his opponent and the request was recorded in a white house transcript when the transcript was released on sept 25 it put republican senators in a bind they had to choose between country and party between abandoning trump and defending collusion they chose to embrace collusion i looked at the transcript risch told an idaho tv station this conversation that the president had with the head of ukraine is a typical conversation the senator argued that trump s statements in the call were absolutely normal ordinary regular things when a reporter asked risch to address the incriminating parts of the transcript the senator talked over him and shut the conversation down insisting i saw nothing in the conversation that was inappropriate we re done here johnson too fell in line after a meeting at the white house at which he and other republican lawmakers received the transcript and trump s talking points the senator told reporters that the transcript showed nothing wrong with the call we all kind of looked at it and said there s nothing here said johnson the next day he elaborated i never got any sense at all there was any kind of pressure on zelensky i just put the best construction on the call when a reporter for the milwaukee journal sentinel asked johnson whether he was troubled that even absent a quid pro quo the president would ask a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent of his johnson dismissed the question almost everybody who is saying that is just troubled that donald trump is president the senator scoffed graham like his colleagues says the call is fine on sunday in an interview with margaret brennan of cbs news he defended it line by line graham described trump s pitch to zelensky this way we are very generous to the ukraine other countries like germany should do more and oh by the way i have heard that this prosecutor that got fired maybe he was a good guy and they fired him because he was looking at joe biden s son could you look into that graham s paraphrase of the call was by his own previous standard collusion but he defended trump s message to zelensky even when brennan cited other incriminating parts of the call she noted that trump in the transcript brings up the biden family and the need for an investigation he repeatedly lays that out and also the aid package is mentioned she asked graham you have no problem with any of this graham replied i have zero problems with this phone call brennan persisted do you think it was ethical for the president to bring up joe biden graham replied yes absolutely the president thinks these declarations of innocence exonerate him at the white house on wednesday he claimed that graham privately told him the call was unimpeachable lindsey graham said i never knew you were that nice a person trump told reporters he said you never asked zelensky for anything you were really really nice that was a perfect conversation it s true that the chairman of the judiciary committee sees nothing wrong with the conversation nor do the chairmen of the committees on homeland security and foreign relations but that doesn t mean the conversation was perfect it means that the republican party no longer believes it s wrong to enlist the help of foreign governments to win an election it has become the party of collusion readers like you make our work possible help us continue to provide the reporting commentary and criticism you won t find anywhere else you ve run
