profit margins from sellers of footwear and clothing to electronics to bicycles to bibles if the cost of the goods rise retailers may import less retail industry analysts at ubs wrote in a note to investors last week that means fewer goods to sell it may also mean lower profit margins if consumers are unwilling to pay higher prices or companies decide not to pass on the added cost for many

would typically tend to try to offset those decreases in our margins by lowering our overhead and that s basically what we re doing foreman said some retailers told foreman they will immediately pass on the higher costs to consumers while others are looking to split it with the companies that import products like his basic fun toys foreman said in the call the white house vowed last week to take strong action if china devalued its currency with the purpose of neutralizing tariffs indeed the treasury department officially labeled china a currency manipulator after the yuan its currency declined in value following the u s tariff threats and mr trump has implied that a lower chinese currency could mean imports end up costing companies less but such currency movements haven t cut costs for u s companies much so far analysts at goldman sachs argued this week in a note to investors a devalued yuan at first glance might seem to lower costs of chinese goods for u s importers the goldman analysts explained but u s international trade is invoiced mainly in dollars and prices tend to be sticky that results in just a modest price change for importers especially on consumer goods the goldman analysts wrote american consumers and businesses are taking the biggest hit in the form of higher prices and costs so far recent research suggests in may a study from the federal reserve said mr trump s china tariffs could cost the average family 831 a year the upcoming tariffs on consumer products while less than the 25 mr trump initially had threatened earlier this year mean the average
