the following is a transcript of an interview with robert o brien that aired sunday february 2 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan we begin this morning with president trump s national security adviser robert o brien good morning to you mr ambassador national security adviser robert o brien good morning thanks for having me margaret brennan how satisfied are you with the information that the chinese government is sharing do we know where this virus came from o brien we don t now we re we re working with the the chinese authorities their health authorities and the world health organization and our own folks to to get to the bottom of it so far the chinese have been more transparent certainly than in past crises and we appreciate that and we continue to offer assistance to the chinese we ve offered to send over cdc and other u s medical and public health professionals and we have not heard back yet from the chinese on those offers but we re prepared to continue to cooperate with them margaret brennan there were a number of reports though that local government officials in wuhan didn t flag this and in fact may have covered up the extent of this virus is beijing being transparent now o brien well we we hope so and and we ve asked them for transparency and we re starting to see your reporter in the intro had the the new numbers i think there were 2 000 more cases we re up to almost 15 000 cases of infection in china i think 300 deaths and we have eight here in the u s so right now there s there s no reason for americans to to panic this is something that is a low risk we think in the u s but president trump from the day he took office made protecting americans and keeping them safe whether it s from terrorists or criminal organizations or from viruses like the new novel coronavirus is top priority so so we re taking steps to keep americans safe and the government is functioning in that direction margaret brennan you know china has allowed some world health organization experts in but you are saying specifically you want american members of the cdc on the ground what would their role be and why is china saying no o brien we don t know that look we know what the role of our folks would be we ve got a very probably the top public health officials in the world are are resident here in the united states with the cdc and the nih we ve got tremendous expertise we ve got the greatest medical system in the world and and look this is a worldwide concern we want to help our chinese colleagues if we can and and we ll see we ve made the offer and we ll we ll see if they accept the offer but but this is this is serious it s serious for china it s serious for the region and for the world that s why we re taking the steps we re taking to protect americans right now margaret brennan and you need american boots on the ground essentially doctors to actually be able to trust the information o brien look i think we can be helpful if we re on the ground right now the chinese are providing information to us and we re taking that for what it s worth but at the same time we re monitoring ourselves and and what we re especially doing is monitoring the situation here in the united states to make sure americans are are continue to be safe from this virus margaret brennan you know the chinese government has taken umbrage at some remarks by u s officials and we know the u s and chinese economies are inter interdependent in many many ways but this is what the commerce secretary said this week begin sot wilbur ross it does give businesses yet another thing to consider because you had sars you have the african swine virus there now you have this it s another risk factor that people need to take into account so i think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to north america end sot margaret brennan is that a fair description of the impact of this virus o brien well i think it s a fair description i mean this is a public health crisis this is not a a trade issue we just signed a great phase one trade deal with china we re negotiating margaret brennan but he s saying o brien phase two deal margaret brennan he s saying it will help the u s economy at the expense of china o brien no i don t think that s what wilbur s saying i think what the secretary of commerce is saying is that we ve got our supply lines extended very far into places where we can t mitigate the risk always either political risk or health risks or that sort of thing so american companies for many years push their supply chains out to asia i think what commerce secretary ross is saying is there s a danger there s a risk factor in doing that and wouldn t it be better if we had supply chains and factories here in the u s so so that our folks weren t weren t margaret brennan because if o brien weren t facing some of the risks that you face when you re overseas margaret brennan chinese officials have have said they didn t take that in the way you re characterizing it and the ambassador here actually just yesterday was saying it sounds like some are saying there s an economic benefit to the united states o brien yeah i i i don t think that s how the president views it margaret brennan okay o brien i don t think that s how secretary ross views it i think what what their what secretary ross has pointed out though is that when you extend a supply chain across the world to try and get cheaper labor and and cheaper the cost of goods that there s a there s a risk in doing that and he s he s saying that american companies ought to think twice before they extend the supply chain halfway across the world where you do have health risk you ve got political instability risk you ve got you know economic risk of technology transfers so so there are a lot of reasons to to consider keeping our factories and our jobs here in america we think that s that s good for the country but that s that s that that doesn t have anything to do with this virus i mean obviously this is a terrible thing for the chinese people it s terrible for the world and we want to do everything we can to and the president wants to do everything he can to help president xi and to help the chinese people deal with this terrible health public health crisis margaret brennan now we know the markets and the world are watching what happens with this virus but i also want to ask you about the national security council and this decision we heard this week from the white house that there is an effort to block at least some of john bolton s book the man who had your job before you stepped into the role the nsc says it contains significant amounts of classified material and his lawyers say that s just not true have you reviewed the book personally o brien so so so here here s the thing the the book is i i want to be very careful about talking about this because it could end up in judicial proceedings or or litigation the national margaret brennan meaning the white house is prepared to fight this to block the release of the book o brien well well here s the thing when when ambassador bolton came in or when i came in and you re read into sensitive compartmented classified programs and you see classified documents and you re involved in meetings where state secrets are discussed you you sign a document a nondisclosure agreement margaret brennan right o brien saying that you won t disclose that material if you want to write a book afterwards or you want to give a speech or publish an article you have to put that through the review process and there are career career professionals who go through the manuscript and very carefully and determine whether there s classified material margaret brennan right o brien they ve been in touch with ambassador bolton s lawyer and and they ll continue to be in touch margaret brennan since that letter this week o brien yeah yeah they ll they ll continue to be in touch you ve seen the letter they ll continue to be in touch with ambassador bolton s lawyer because what we need to do as the national security council is to make sure that state secrets and and important classified information that could jeopardize american lives are not released margaret brennan did anyone on the nsc leak it o brien no margaret brennan and have you asked members of the nsc o brien yeah margaret brennan that question o brien i i said this before on the record i i m very confident that that that the leaks of that book did not come from the nsc margaret brennan is can anyone on the nsc verify what the pres what what bolton has said i mean what about john eisenberg who is legal counsel for nsc o brien well well margaret brennan and was there at the time did bolton memorialize these conversations he says he witnessed between the president and others telling him to get involved o brien i mean margaret brennan with giuliani o brien i i think that s something that s going to be investigated what what kind of notes ambassador bolton has or had or or didn t have and and so but what the president has said at least with with respect to the the allegation that ambassador bolton made that he told him to call zelensky the president has said that did not happen i believe that bill barr and mike pompeo have said that that did not happen and so look it s it s always it s always disappointing when someone who has access to the most confidential close information margaret brennan yeah o brien a close relationship with the president decides to leave the white house and do a tell all book margaret brennan well o brien and and they re they look if someone has margaret brennan we have to o brien if someone has political differences that s fine we ve got to be careful margaret brennan okay o brien about the classified information margaret brennan ambassador thank you o brien great to be with you thank you watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7
