nation following chaos at the caucuses in iowa will the democratic party be able to pull it together for new hampshire and beyond and after impeachment relations between republicans and democrats hit new lows and a vindictive president trump strikes back against people he sees as enemies last week it was the democrats turn to deal with disaster as monday s iowa caucuses gave republicans reason to rejoice president donald trump the votes are fried they have no idea who won they have no idea margaret brennan he s right about that as the 2020 democratic pac left iowa behind hoping for a brighter result from new hampshire mayor pete buttigieg and senator bernie sanders appear to have tied in iowa and they re now battling for the top spot in the granite state we have brand new battleground tracker numbers this morning and we ll talk to both of them plus with impeachment dismissed an emboldened president trump took aim at his enemies president donald trump russia russia russia it was all bull expletive deleted margaret brennan and launched a stunning attack on both republican senator mitt romney who voted to remove him from office and house speaker nancy pelosi who had a shocking moment of her own when she tore up the president s state of the union speech president donald trump i don t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong nor do i like people who say i pray for you when they know that that s not so margaret brennan then in apparent retaliation for providing damaging testimony in the impeachment hearings lieutenant colonel alexander vindman was removed from his national security council role and eu ambassador gordon sondland was recalled from his post we ll talk to lindsey graham who warned democrats last week about the fallout from impeachment senator lindsey graham what you have done is unleash the partisan forces of hell margaret brennan plus the chinese ambassador to the u s cui tiankai weighs in on the spread of the coronavirus in an interview you ll see only on face the nation all that and more is just ahead on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation we are still not really sure exactly who won iowa but cbs news has so far awarded vermont senator bernie sanders and former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg an equal number of delegates with just two days from the new hampshire primary our cbs news battleground tracker shows the two are at the top in new hampshire too vermont senator bernie sanders who won the new hampshire primary four years ago is at the very top with twenty nine percent former mayor pete buttigieg is running behind him he s at twenty five percent we ll have the full results of our poll later on in the broadcast but we begin with those two top candidates senator bernie sanders is up first and he joins us from manchester good morning to you senator senator bernie sanders i vermont berniesanders democratic presidential candidate good morning margaret margaret brennan how do you plan to keep that edge and win on tuesday senator bernie sanders we are running all over the state we are talking to as many people as we can we re talking about what our agenda is which is an agenda that speaks for the working families of this country an agenda that is prepared to take on the powerful special interest that have so much influence over the economic and political life of our country and by the way we re going to contrast our views with mayor buttigieg and one of the areas of contrast to be honest with you is that last count he has about forty billionaires who are contributing to his campaign the heads of the ceos of the large pharmaceutical industries of the insurance companies and so forth margaret brennan why does that matter senator bernie sanders well on the other hand oh it matters enormously that is precisely the problem with american politics when you have the heads of large pharmaceutical companies contributing to your campaign you are not going to aggressively deal with the fact that in some cases we pay ten times more for the same exact drugs as our friends in canada or in europe pay you re not going to take on the collusion and the corruption of the drug companies who are ripping us off every single day one out of five americans cannot even afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe margaret brennan mm hm senator bernie sanders so do you really think that when somebody gets contributions from the ceos of drug companies they re going to stand up to the greed and corruption of that industry i don t think so margaret brennan but senator bernie sanders but it s not only the pharmaceutical industry margaret brennan but when you were standing on that senator bernie sanders but it s other industries as well margaret brennan when you were standing on that debate stage on friday you said that democrats would come together and support a nominee are you saying senator bernie sanders yes yeah margaret brennan bernie sanders will support pete buttigieg if he ends up being the nominee senator bernie sanders no i margaret brennan or even mike bloomberg senator bernie sanders absolute margaret brennan a billionaire himself senator bernie sanders i no i did not say that at all i think all of them will be far preferable to donald trump who is the most dangerous and corrupt president in the modern history of this country margaret brennan so you would senator bernie sanders we have got to defeat trump margaret brennan sorry to be clear senator bernie sanders and what i have margaret brennan you would support either of them if they end up being the nominee senator bernie sanders margaret margaret i have said from the first day of this campaign that it is absolutely imperative that we defeat donald trump of course i will support who the democratic nominee is but in the democratic primary process i will distinguish myself differentiate myself from the other candidates and one of the areas that we that margaret brennan mm hm senator bernie sanders i differentiate myself is we have raised more campaign contributions from more americans averaging all of eighteen dollars and fifty cents than any candidate in the history of this country margaret brennan your campaign reported some inconsistencies in the results out in iowa as did two other campaigns columnist peggy noonan wrote this they can t run a tiny caucus in a tiny state but they want us to believe they can reinvent american health care how damaging is it that the democrats couldn t get this right senator bernie sanders it is damaging and i and it really saddens me because you know i went all over the state of iowa and they are beautiful people good people who take their responsibility seriously and the fact that the iowa democratic party that has received all kinds of money could not count those votes in a timely matter is really a sad state of affairs margaret brennan right but you re advocating for the empowerment of the u s government to take over the entire health care system this just optically senator bernie sanders no hold it hold it margaret margaret brennan looks like the party senator bernie sanders margaret margaret margaret brennan can t run its own caucus senator bernie sanders margaret margaret that s not a true statement i am not advocating for the united states government to take over the health care system what i am advocating for is an expansion of medicare medicare exists margaret brennan right senator bernie sanders i want to expand it over a four year period that d be margaret brennan which would be administered by the u s government senator bernie sanders precisely margaret brennan and your administration if you win senator bernie sanders just as medicare is right now but it but it s not a takeover people will still go to the same doctor they will go to the same hospital we will substantially lower the cost of prescription drugs cost per person will go down margaret brennan right but what but i think the the nub of the senator bernie sanders people will be paying less for health care but it s not a takeover margaret brennan the nub of the criticism though is that this is a question of competency and straight out of the gate how do you reassure the public that the party whose ticket you are senator bernie sanders okay margaret brennan running on can do this and do this successfully in the states ahead nevada is already senator bernie sanders well margaret brennan saying when it comes to their caucuses they are short of volunteers our campaign reporter says they are short a thousand caucus chairs and they might have to even hold two caucuses at once this doesn t look efficient senator bernie sanders well all right that may well be the case but let s get back to the united states government i m not the chair of the nevada democratic party margaret brennan you told my colleague norah o donnell recently on cbs that you couldn t put a price tag on your health care plan and your proposals but i want to ask you for some clarity here because back in july you told the washington post medicare for all would cost between thirty to forty trillion dollars over senator bernie sanders right margaret brennan ten years do you still trust those numbers senator bernie sanders right margaret brennan and those estimates senator bernie sanders sure all that i said the answer is yes but all that i said is anybody who tells you what anything is going to cost in health care is is not telling you the truth there is so much it s so big if we do nothing what the health and human services margaret brennan so it s not thirty to forty trillion senator bernie sanders over a ten year period margaret brennan okay senator bernie sanders sure i mean the the problem is we re already spending about fifty percent of health care dollars already come from the federal government we ve got to add the other fifty percent but here s the main point that people should appreciate if we do nothing according to health and human services we re going to be spending fifty trillion dollars we spend twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of canada or europe so of course we can provide health care to all people spending less than we are doing now because we re going to end margaret brennan mm hm senator bernie sanders the hundred billion dollars in profiteering that goes to the drug companies that goes to the margaret brennan okay senator bernie sanders insurance companies and the hundreds of billions of dollars in administration of thousands of separate plans enormously complicated and wasteful system margaret brennan senator sanders thank you for your time we now turn to former south bend mayor pete buttigieg he is at his campaign headquarters in manchester good morning to you pete buttigieg former mayor of south bend indiana petebuttigieg democratic presidential candidate good morning thanks for having me margaret brennan according to our latest figures you re about four points behind senator bernie sanders how do you close the gap and make the argument that moderates should vote for you and not joe biden pete buttigieg well new hampshire is a state that likes to think for itself and we ll be engaging democrats as well as a lot of undeclared voters and maybe a handful of republicans who who know that they won t agree with me on everything but are just sick of looking their kids in the eye and trying to defend or explain this presidency that kind of hard work we ll be putting in all the way until polls close on tuesday and we re confident that it s going to lead to a great night margaret brennan well you also have to throw a few elbows here back at bernie sanders who basically is calling you a little inauthentic he s going after some of your financial base saying you ve got at least forty billionaires with ties to the pharmaceutical industry other big money interests he s basically saying you re bought and paid for how do you respond to that pete buttigieg well i ve never hesitated to stand up to industry we sued the pharmaceutical industry when opioid opioid makers ravaged our community and i am campaigning right now for higher taxes for the wealthy and for corporations to finally have to pay their fair share and my campaign has been built from the grassroots we have hundreds of thousands of supporters most of whom went on peteforamerica com and chipped in a few bucks because they share this vision that we have for the future you know being the mayor of south bend indiana is not an establishment powerhouse we re here because this message this vision that i m offering is connecting with voters of all backgrounds and at a time like this if somebody is ready to help us put together the campaign that s going to defeat donald trump then i welcome that support no matter how they voted in the past no matter if they ve got a lot of money or not i want their help because let me tell you donald trump and his allies right now are doing everything they can to hold on to power margaret brennan yeah pete buttigieg they just raised twenty five million bucks in a day we need to go into that fight with everything that we ve got and i m not going to define my campaign by whose help we reject or whose support we turn away this is a moment to bring everybody that we can into common cause just as we have to unify the country after we do win margaret brennan joe biden says you re unelectable inexperienced and today said you re unable to unify the black community he also released a digital ad let s listen woman biden for president campaign ad joe biden helped save the auto industry which revitalized the economy of the midwest and led the passage and implementation of the recovery act saving our economy from a depression pete buttigieg revitalized the sidewalks of downtown south bend by laying out decorative brick and both biden and buttigieg have made hard decisions despite pressure from the nra joe biden passed the assault weapons banned through congress then he passed the violence against women act and even when public pressure mounted against him former mayor pete fired the first african american police chief of south bend and then he forced out the african american fire chief too margaret brennan how do you respond to that pete buttigieg well it s a typical political attack that doesn t tell most of the story he makes no mention of the work that we did for example in my administration appointing the first african american top lawyer for the city helping the first citywide executive african american woman get elected in south bend and really minimizing the experience of my city and i know that a lot of mayors are speaking up today about the idea that what happens in communities doesn t count margaret brennan but what pete buttigieg maybe my community does look good from does look small from the perspective of washington but to us a lot of times it s the infighting in the washington establishment margaret brennan right pete buttigieg that looks small and the work that we re doing on the ground in communities that are tired of being treated as a washington punch line margaret brennan lastly how do you instill confidence in the public that the democratic party can run this election with integrity given the confusion that just happened in iowa pete buttigieg well the delay was frustrating i imagine nobody had more cause to be frustrated than i did but at the end of the day this is about voters standing up and talking about and voting for the future that they want it s voters asking the question how s my life going to be different depending which president that we get and for all the the the party behind the scenes machinery what matters most at the end of the day is that the american people are going to send a statement and the majority that we have right now not just unified around wanting a different and better president than donald trump but even more importantly unified around what we re for having corporations pay their fair share raising wages acting on climate change getting everybody health care delivering paid family leave acting on gun violence margaret brennan right pete buttigieg these are america s priorities margaret brennan but tom perez who is pete buttigieg they re our priority in our party margaret brennan head of the dnc pete buttigieg and certainly the priority on my campaign margaret brennan tom perez who s head of the dnc is saying that perhaps the national party should be taking more of a role here that s not instilling a lot of confidence about these local officials what do you think pete buttigieg i ll i ll let the party work on what the party does i am focused on what we need to do with the powers of the american presidency to change the trajectory of this country before it is too late and i believe that there is a strong enough majority for what we seek to do that there will be an unambiguous decisive result not just to end the trump presidency but to put trump ism itself in the history books if and only if we have a platform and a and a campaign based on unity and belonging it s why i m concerned about a message that says that either you re for a revolution or you must be for the status quo most americans don t know where they fit in that story i am offering a different approach and that s clearly serving us well and we re going to be on the ground connecting with as many new hampshire voters as possible in these remaining hours to make that case and earn that win margaret brennan all right we ll be watching thank you mayor pete and we will be back in one minute with republican senator lindsey graham announcements margaret brennan we turn now to the chairman of the senate judiciary committee lindsey graham senator good morning to you senator lindsey graham r south carolina lindseygrahamsc judiciary committee chairman good morning margaret brennan the president s up he s watching apparently because he sent out a tweet this morning about you appearing on this program he said deface the nation will tell lindsey graham they must start up the judiciary and not stop i m not exactly sure quite what that means but it sounds like he s giving you marching orders senator lindsey graham i think what he s talking about is oversight of the fisa warrant system that failed i can promise the president and your viewers that i m going to call witnesses about margaret brennan foreign surveillance warrants the horowitz report senator lindsey graham yeah the horowitz report you know mccabe comey rosenstein yates how did you miss it so badly how could you issue four warrants against an american citizen based on information that was unreliable but here s what i want to tell the president i m not going to be the republican christopher steele so rudy giuliani last night said he s got the goods on hunter biden i called the attorney general this morning and richard burr the chairman of the intel committee and they told me take very cautiously anything coming out of the ukraine against anybody so what i will do is i will get to the bottom of how the fisa warrant system failed and make sure we reform it doesn t happen again i think questions about the conflict of interest regarding hunter biden in the ukraine need to be asked the state department had warnings and they ignored the conflict of interest the whistleblower episode needs to be investigated by richard burr but if rudy giuliani has any information coming out of the ukraine he needs to turn over the department of justice because it could be russian propaganda margaret brennan you last time you re on this program though in december you said giuliani should come to the judiciary committee with what he said was a suitcase full of documents he picked up in ukraine senator lindsey graham yeah margaret brennan on the bidens are you saying you don t want any part of this anymore senator lindsey graham after talking to the attorney general and the intelligence chairman that any documents coming out of the ukraine against any american republican or democrat need to be looked at by the intelligence services who has expertise i don t because russia is playing us all like a fiddle and christopher steele was played by the russians that started the russian investigation against president trump margaret brennan right senator lindsey graham it was all garbage margaret brennan are you saying rudy giuliani senator lindsey graham and i don t want to do the same thing margaret brennan rudy giuliani is getting played by the russians senator lindsey graham i don t know i am saying that the attorney margaret brennan well it sounds like that s what you re suggesting senator lindsey graham i m saying that anybody who s got any information coming from the ukraine needs to turn it over to the intelligence community as to senator schumer warning parnas in the audience if you don t understand margaret brennan this is one of rudy giuliani s business associates senator lindsey graham yes crooked as snake margaret brennan who s been indicted senator lindsey graham facing indictment so schiff gets called by russian hoaxster i ve got photos of president trump in a compromised situation to every american politician you should be very cautious about receiving information coming out of the ukraine margaret brennan right senator lindsey graham and other countries that may be backed by russian misinformation margaret brennan does the president know that because he senator lindsey graham i hope so margaret brennan apparently has continued to senator lindsey graham well if he s watching the show here s what i would tell the president margaret brennan believe that ukraine had a role here senator lindsey graham i m going to get to the bottom of the fisa work process because it was an abuse of power of the department of justice the fbi and we re gonna make sure that hunter biden s conflict of interest is explored because it s legitimate how could joe biden really fight corruption when his son sitting on the burisma board margaret brennan can you clarify you said you talked to attorney general barr senator lindsey graham this morning margaret brennan this morning has the department of justice been ordered to investigate the bidens senator lindsey graham no the department of justice is receiving information coming out of the ukraine from rudy margaret brennan already senator lindsey graham to see he told me that they ve created a process that rudy could give information and they would see if it s verified rudy giuliani is a well known man he s a crime fighter he s loyal to the president he s a good lawyer but what i m trying to say to the president and anybody else that the russians are still up to it deterrence is not working so let s look at hunter biden s conflict let s look at joe biden vice president biden what did you do when they told you your son was on burisma s board it undercuts your ability to fight corruption did you take it seriously obviously he didn t margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham but when it comes to documents coming out of the ukraine to republicans and democrats be very cautious turning margaret brennan but the senator lindsey graham anything over you got over to the intel community margaret brennan have you ever said to the president when he repeats things like the idea that there s the dnc server server hidden in ukraine that this is russian propaganda that he is repeating and apparently believing senator lindsey graham well i ll margaret brennan have you ever said that directly to him senator lindsey graham well i don t have any information about the server being in the ukraine margaret brennan but you just said senator lindsey graham and it was the russians margaret brennan things coming out of ukraine should be looked at with high scrutiny senator lindsey graham here s my point margaret brennan because of russian interference senator lindsey graham my point it was the russians who hacked into the dnc not the ukrainians margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham but there are people in the ukraine that were pulling against trump because they hated manafort to suggest there was no political interference coming out of the ukraine directed toward the president i think would be would not withstand scrutiny margaret brennan when you have a role as chairman of senate judiciary to have oversight senator lindsey graham yeah margaret brennan of justice department senator lindsey graham i m not in charge of the whole government margaret brennan but i understand that however when you re talking about being asked to do these things and a channel being open between rudy giuliani and the justice department this sounds a lot like this is in some ways a taxpayer funded oppo research operation against joe biden isn t this exactly what was at the heart of the impeachment probe to begin with senator lindsey graham no not at all there are plenty of people being contacted by folks from the ukraine adam schiff got contacted by somebody thought to be a russian and he was willing to get on a plane apparently and go find the documents schumer believes that parnas has got the goods parnas says i m in on it i ve never met parnas so democrats are being played and i m not going to be played so we re going to look at the hunter biden joe biden connection to the ukraine we re going to ask the state department why didn t you do something about the conflict of interest margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham when the john kerry s chief of staff was warned about hunter biden s conflict on burisma margaret brennan right senator lindsey graham what did you do if anything that s all legitimate rudy says he s got the goods all i can tell rudy and anybody else if you got some information connected to the ukraine against anybody go to the intel committee not me margaret brennan you you don t want a part of it right now we need to finish this conversation senator lindsey graham okay margaret brennan because you brought up a number of things so we re going to have to take a quick break i do want to to to say though that to this point nothing has been in any way substantiated in regard to corruption when it comes to joe biden himself his son served on the board and was paid for it senator lindsey graham i just think the media is so in the tank over this issue margaret brennan no but senator lindsey graham it makes me sick to my stomach margaret brennan you just said senator lindsey graham we ll talk about it in a minute margaret brennan right but you were saying it needs to be investigated senator lindsey graham yeah nobody s investigating it margaret brennan you re acknowledging there s no proof of it senator lindsey graham cbs hasn t sent sent one reporter margaret brennan to ukraine yes we did senator lindsey graham yeah i don t think you take it seriously margaret brennan we are so we re taking a break and i m coming back to talk to you about it senator lindsey graham good margaret brennan on the other side of it so stay with us all of you senator lindsey graham good margaret brennan senator graham is going to stay with us we ll continue in a few moments announcements margaret brennan over the weekend in wuhan china the first american died from the coronavirus and here in the u s the number of confirmed cases is now at twelve in our next half hour we ll talk with the chinese ambassador to the u s about the epidemic announcements margaret brennan some of our stations are leaving us now but stay with us because we will be right back in our second half hour with more from senator lindsey graham and analysis of the week from our political panel we ll be back with a lot more face the nation announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we continue our conversation now with south carolina republican senator lindsey graham senator we were talking about the president s tweet this morning the requests that have been made of you in terms of continuing investigations this morning on fox rudy giuliani is continuing to say quote you are telling him not my job not my job man when it comes to information he says he s handing over you were just saying that any information coming out of ukraine needs to be dealt with carefully and skeptically because it s likely the product of some kind of senator lindsey graham it it margaret brennan russian intelligence operation senator lindsey graham have we learned anything from christopher steele dossier it was all a bunch of garbage fed to christopher steele to go after trump margaret brennan and that s what you think rudy giuliani senator lindsey graham and i m telling schumer margaret brennan is delivering garbage senator lindsey graham i don t know i m telling schumer don t vouch for parnas margaret brennan okay senator lindsey graham don t put him in the gallery i m telling rudy you think you got the goods don t give it to me because what do we know we know that the russian disinformation campaign was used against president trump they hacked into the dnc system not the ukrainians margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham and they re on the ground all over the world trying to affect democracy all over the world margaret brennan who s paying rudy giuliani senator lindsey graham i don t know here s my message to rudy if you ve got something coming from the ukraine turn it over to the intelligence people the department of justice to any democrat margaret brennan got it senator lindsey graham you think parnas has got something on me well then go to the department of justice and the intel committee do not pass this stuff on margaret brennan okay i want to ask you as well because you have served in the u s air force you are a military lawyer a jag senator lindsey graham mm hm margaret brennan do you support president trump s decision to dismiss alex vindman the lieutenant colonel who was serving on the national security council who was compelled by a subpoena to go under oath and testify against the president senator lindsey graham i think his reassignment was justified i don t think he could be effective at the nsc as much as i support our military people telling the truth when asked it s important they do what have i learned in the last two years cia agents department of state department of justice lawyers fbi agents have a political agenda and they acted on it and we found that out through the fisa investigation as to colonel vindman he was not allowed to be asked questions about his connection to the alleged whistleblower to people working on schiff s margaret brennan he was asked and he denied having any senator lindsey graham no he was not margaret brennan well senator lindsey graham they did not allow him margaret brennan he was asked during the testimony senator lindsey graham they did not allow the republicans go down that road two things margaret brennan his brother was also marched out of the white house senator lindsey graham all i can say is margaret brennan his brother also serves in military senator lindsey graham right margaret brennan and had no connection senator lindsey graham he has no he has no right margaret brennan to this impeachment senator lindsey graham nobody knows this i can promise you this he s never been asked questions did you leak to the whistleblower people in his chain of command have been suspicious of him regarding his political point of view margaret brennan the national security adviser to the president sat in the chair you re sitting in last week and said he was confident that there were no leaks from the national security council senator lindsey graham well i am not i want the man to be asked about what he did with the information i appreciate his service but there are fbi agents who took the law in their own hands there are cia agents who took the law in their own hands there are department of justice lawyers who lied to the court there has been a movement since president trump was elected by people in our government margaret brennan is this retaliation senator lindsey graham to take him down margaret brennan because the president has tweeted basically saying that vindman was forced out not because of senator lindsey graham he is margaret brennan any kind of policy issue not because of anything else except for senator lindsey graham well margaret we re going to get margaret brennan what he said was listening in on his phone calls and giving horrendous report senator lindsey graham we re not going to be intimidated in against asking margaret brennan but doesn t this senator lindsey graham questions to the whistleblower margaret brennan somebody senator lindsey graham who is the whistleblower margaret brennan he is an officer and he is not allowed to speak out on his own behalf neither are his fellow military officers allowed to do so senator lindsey graham he was shut down i don t know what role he played with the whistleblower if any but we re going to look i like joe biden he s a fine man but we re not going to give you a pass because you re margaret brennan should gordon sondland have been fired as well senator lindsey graham he is a political appointee he serves at the pleasure of the president he came before the country margaret brennan of course senator lindsey graham in under oath margaret brennan but it was retaliation senator lindsey graham gave gave gave the story as as he said it we re not going to live in a world where the department of justice the cia and the fbi can cut corners go after trump and nobody gives a damn as to colonel vindman thank you for your service but i m going to margaret brennan yeah senator lindsey graham hopefully somebody will ask questions of you about the role you play with the whistleblower if any and if there s nothing there fine margaret brennan all right senator graham thank you senator lindsey graham thank you margaret brennan for joining us this morning when we come back a rare interview with the chinese ambassador to the u s we ll ask him about the coronavirus announcements margaret brennan we want to take a closer look at efforts to contain the now over thirty seven thousand confirmed cases of coronavirus in china where the death toll stands at at least eight hundred and eleven joining us to talk more about the virus is china s ambassador to the u s welcome to face the nation ambassador cui ambassador cui tiankai chinese ambassador to the u s ambcuitiankai thank you margaret brennan our condolences for these ambassador cui tiankai thank you very much margaret brennan hundreds of fatalities ambassador cui tiankai yeah margaret brennan why hasn t the virus been contained ambassador cui tiankai well you see this is a new virus so virtually very few people knew anything about it at the beginning that s how people are still learning to discover more about the virus and how it affects people and the channels of infections and trying their best to stop it margaret brennan the u s has offered repeatedly ambassador cui tiankai yeah margaret brennan to send cdc experts american experts to help out why does beijing continue to ignore those offers ambassador cui tiankai i don t think it s been ignored first of all margaret brennan well you haven t said yes ambassador cui tiankai well we we welcome the american expert to participate in our efforts and we are coordinating with the world health organization because a lot of things are done under the auspices of the world health organization we certainly welcome american experts to join the actual group that the who the assembly and i m sure they will be going to china very soon margaret brennan you expect americans to be there as part of the who but you don t want the cdc there ambassador cui tiankai there there first of all american experts are on the list recommended by the who we certainly respect i think all of us respect the who as the most professional intergovernmental body in the world and for the u s cdc they have very frequent regular contact with the their chinese counterparts the chinese cdc and even beyond that some american experts have come to china already on their own individual basis so there is ongoing contacts not only between the two governments but also between the two cdcs and between the academic institutions and even some american companies are also offering help technical help margaret brennan well i i asked the question because it also gets at there s a lot of unknown and a lot of suspicion because of that and in fact this week senator tom cotton who sits on the senate intelligence and armed services committee suggested that the virus may have come from china s biological warfare program that s an extraordinary charge how do you respond to that ambassador cui tiankai i think it s true that a lot is still unknown and our scientists chinese scientists american scientists scientists of other countries are doing their best to learn more about the virus but it s very harmful it s very dangerous to stir up suspicion rumors and spread them among the people for one thing this will create panic another thing that it will fend up racial discrimination xenophobia all these things that will really harm our joint efforts to combat the virus of course there are all kinds of speculation and rumors there are people who are saying that these virus are coming from some military lab not of china maybe in the united states how how can we believe all these crazy things margaret brennan you think it s crazy where did the virus come from ambassador cui tiankai absolutely crazy margaret brennan where did the virus come from ambassador cui tiankai we still don t know yet it s probably according to some initial outcome of the research probably coming from some animals but we have to to discover more about it margaret brennan there has been some outcry on social media particularly after the death of doctor li wenliang he had made public warnings for weeks before the government acknowledged this was happening in fact authorities had forced him to disavow what he had said previously which turned out to be true the communist party of china is now investigating this why ambassador cui tiankai well we are all very saddened about the death of doctor li he is a good doctor he was a devoted doctor and he did his best to protect people s health we are so grateful to him but you see he was a doctor and a doctor could be alarmed by some individual cases but as for the government you have to do more you have to base your decisions your announcement on more solid evidence and signs margaret brennan but do you think silencing him in the beginning was a mistake ambassador cui tiankai i i don t know who tried to silence him but there was certainly a disagreement or people were not able to reach agreement on what exactly the virus is margaret brennan mm hm ambassador cui tiankai how it is affecting people so there was a process of trying to discover more to learn more about the virus maybe some people reacted not quickly enough maybe doctor li he perceived some incoming dangers margaret brennan mm hm ambassador cui tiankai earlier than others but this is this could happen anywhere but whenever we find there s some shortcoming margaret brennan yeah ambassador cui tiankai we ll do our best to correct it margaret brennan have chinese authorities detained the citizen journalist chen qiushi he has disappeared and his videos revealed a lot of what was happening with this virus ambassador cui tiankai i m sorry i have not never heard of this guy so i don t have any information to share with you margaret brennan his videos are how the rest of the world has seen some of the images of what s happening i want to also ask you quickly secretary of state mike pompeo gave an extraordinary speech yesterday to a a number of governors from all around the united states and he harshly criticized the chinese communist party and he said that your country is targeting states cities schools academic institutions to try to figure out how to exploit them what exactly is the intention of the chinese government because the secretary of state says it s not good ambassador cui tiankai i always believe the real foundation of china u s relations is the friendship and mutual understanding between our peoples so this is the root of state to state relations and there s such an infusion among american states cities and towns and ordinary americans to learn more about china to develop friendship with chinese people margaret brennan mm hm ambassador cui tiankai to facilitate cooperation between our two countries margaret brennan well he s he s ambassador cui tiankai i don t i don t think anybody has any reason to against the will of the people margaret brennan well he specifically referenced concentration camps in xinjiang he talked about american institutions and inadvertently investing in surveillance of muslim minorities do you want to respond to that point ambassador cui tiankai that s totally wrong that s totally wrong because the core issue in xinjiang is how to combat terrorism you see some years ago until most recently people in xinjiang were victims margaret brennan mm hm ambassador cui tiankai to rising terrorist terrorist attacks there were thousands of such attacks hurting and even killing hundreds of thousands of people so we have to do something to stop this threat margaret brennan mm hm ambassador cui tiankai to the very well being and the lives of the people there margaret brennan okay ambassador cui tiankai so without tremendous efforts now for the last three years margaret brennan yeah ambassador cui tiankai there has been no such terrorist attack so people have a much better safety there security there and people are happy there margaret brennan all right ambassador thank you for telling your side of the story we will be right back with new numbers from our cbs news battleground tracker announcements margaret brennan we turn now to some political analysis from our panel jeffrey goldberg is the editor in chief in the atlantic leslie sanchez is a cbs news political contributor jamal simmons is the host on hill tv and also cbs news political contributor and jerry seib is the executive washington editor at the wall street journal it is great to have you all here i want to get to the new poll numbers but first i think we need to digest some of what we just heard we had two pretty substantial interviews jeffrey the chinese ambassador at the tail end of our interview said people in xinjiang china are very happy to be clear the u s government says there are between one and three million muslim minorities in camps the pentagon has called them concentration camps jeffrey goldberg the atlantic jeffreygoldberg right margaret brennan how do we knowing that kind of denial jeffrey goldberg mm hm margaret brennan of what is established fact how do we understand everything he told us jeffrey goldberg well what you have to understand is that the chinese government is lying about the nature of what s happening in these camps when you take between one and three million people of a particular ethnic group against their will and concentrate them in prison camps for reeducation it seems like a fair thing to say that that s a concentration camp the chinese ambassador is arguing that the people are happy i would simply suggest that you should let the international media in to these camps and we ll go ask them ourselves margaret brennan i will take them up on that invitation if that ever i mean jeffrey goldberg yeah i mean you know yeah road to on a panel road trip margaret brennan yes jeffrey goldberg yeah yeah margaret brennan there we go it is i just i wanted to make sure we didn t leave that there jerry i want to pick up with you on some of what we heard from senator graham as well the president sent that tweet right as the show went on the air it was directly aimed at one of our guests who he knew gerald seib wall street journal geraldfseib mm hm margaret brennan was going to be appearing what did you make of what lindsey graham said he was willing to do and what the president seemed to be asking him to do gerald seib well i think first of all we re at kind of an awkward transition point here which we re moving beyond impeachment and beyond the mueller report potentially but the president doesn t really want to he wants some retribution you saw that over the weekend with the firing of witnesses and he wants to know who s the whistleblower and he wants the bidens investigated and i think lindsey graham was saying hold on let s not go down that path don t turn me into the republican party s christopher steele as he said here and so i think you have the emergence of some tension within the trump coalition about whether we really want to continue going down this path or that maybe it s time to declare victory and move on margaret brennan leslie i mean doesn t that get back at the heart of what this impeachment inquiry was about which was this question of things being aimed with taxpayer dollars at actually being part of a political opposition research arm rather than what they are officially called leslie sanchez cbs news political contributor lesliesanchez well that s particularly the case with fisa right and the president has strong grounds to stand on when he was saying that there was an extension beyond what it should have been but particularly i think you have to look at it from a political lens the president knows that there is a lot of he and he called it witch hunts he called it corruption that he wants illuminated he wants more transparency and he s really relying on the senate to do that the independents i know we we talk about this politically it works politically it s part of an effort that galvanizes and really it it s building a cohesive bases behind the president wanting to illuminate these issues jamal simmons hill tv jamalsimmons cbs news political contributor it s amazing to me that they want to illuminate issues in the united states senate when they refused to call witnesses in the midst of an impeachment trial when we were having real time information coming out in the press for people to find out about what the president was up to at the same time we re saying the president now began to punish witnesses who came forward fire people from their jobs move them out of the way i think we re now we re now seeing donald trump unleashed and it is as frightening as people thought it might be margaret brennan you believe these investigations or calls for them will continue as long as joe biden stays in this presidential race jamal simmons well i m sure and i m sure he ll move on to someone else it may not be the ukrainians where they ll find somewhere else to go after pete buttigieg or michael bloomberg or whoever becomes the democratic frontrunner jeffrey goldberg the the pattern in washington is to move on but donald trump doesn t move on and that s what we re going to see in the next few months margaret brennan joe biden we ll see how he fares on tuesday but he didn t really have a very good week at least kind of a rocky start certainly out in iowa you know he he was thought to be at least in the top three i i want was a distant fourth in our most recent battleground tracker numbers i want to tell you the current rankings bernie sanders as we mentioned top spot twenty nine percent pete buttigieg twenty five percent third elizabeth warren at seventeen percent then biden twelve percent then amy klobuchar ten percent and this survey in the field before the debates so we ll see these numbers are fluid up in new hampshire where the poll was conducted well what do we make of this i mean joe biden still in in the fourth spot here jamal jamal simmons he is and i got to tell you when i take a look at this and i see joe biden in fourth place in iowa i see him perhaps coming in at fourth place in new hampshire i m not sure what happens in nevada but there s this sense that he s going to hold on to south carolina and that just defies all political logic each one of these things is building on each other i think that voters he s counting on those older african american voters in south carolina are paying attention to what s happening in these early states and if he looks like they re they re with him because they think he s a winner and if he s not winning i m not sure how they hold on to that the other thing that we know here is that elizabeth warren seems to overperforming her poll numbers but with an organizing so that means she s probably in third place maybe she comes up a little bit better and bernie sanders though is probably going to win another one of these states which means that democrats in dc and around the country are going to be really wrestling with what to do next margaret brennan and leslie is that the republican sort of best wish best hope to have bernie sanders be the nominee leslie sanchez absolutely because the contrast will be very stark and i want to go back to this impeachment issue jamal with all with all due respect on that issue the one thing that it did do from a political standpoint is it accelerated the campaign not only in organizing the president s message which has proven to be very particularly effective but has also increased the negatives on the hunter biden issue that you re seeing kind of the the down the effect real politique with joe biden and i don t know if he s going to be able to survive that it s been very impactful but money they raised a hundred and seventeen million dollars meaning the trump campaign and the apparatus just within the time of impeachment so while the party is very organized around this message and around you know the contrast to that the democrats are are obviously very fractured and you know it can speak more about that margaret brennan jeffrey the president essentially launched his own reelection on the floor of the state giving the state of the union address this week prior to that he had the big super bowl ad he seems to be making i want you to weigh in on this too jamal he seems to be making a push at trying to build support among minorities in particular jeffrey goldberg yeah margaret brennan he thinks that he that s winnable for him he s really focused on that in his ads and he was focused on it in his language at state jeffrey goldberg right margaret brennan of the union jeffrey goldberg right he was not only launching his reelection campaign it seems like he was also launching a new reality tv show at the same time it was amazing thing to watch given for people who ve watched state of the unions in the past yes there s there s a very concerted effort to work on african american votes that s through the through various prison reform judicial reform issues you know he doesn t do terribly poorly with latino males in some in some parts of the country you know we ve all said this in a million different ways takeaway twitter from donald trump takeaway some of the the extra meanness and and focus the message he could reach certain minority communities people of color in in in ways that he is not and i am wondering if he has the discipline to keep this pivot going or the next time someone a person of color annoys him he goes out of his way to attack them and remind people what his record is on questions of race but there s definitely an effort jamal simmons i m going to send this flag up to the democratic party people need to understand this we talked to terrance woodbury a young african american pollster he has been saying for months that he thinks trump is going very hard at african american men particularly younger african american men kim and kanye west asap rocky getting out of sweden hbcu money he s got a whole list of things the president has been doing i think they re not going to let up and he doesn t have to win it he just have to tick it up a couple of points in some key places to have it count and democrats need to have a candidate who really has a strategy about how to deal with that and if bernie sanders is not the nominee i will tell you a lot of those a lot of bernie sanders voters are anti establishment voters more than their democrats and they might get wooed by donald trump gerald seib and and this also comes at a time when the hottest democratic presidential candidate happens to be pete buttigieg who has noticeable problems with the african american community so maybe there s a kind of harmonic convergence here but i also wanted to add that the other person who had a great week this week was michael bloomberg right margaret brennan mm hm gerald seib so the scenario that s unfolding right now is got to be exactly the one that bloomberg had in mind when he got into the race late a fade by joe biden growing concern within the democratic party about nominating somebody as liberal as bernie sanders and a really resilient president trump emerging as a threat to win reelection that s the bloomberg formula and it s all kind of fallen into place this week so he s sitting on the sideline right now listening to everything we re talking about and saying well that was kind of my bargain margaret brennan yeah gerald seib when i got in margaret brennan all right thanks to all of you jamal simmons thank you margaret brennan for helping us digest it all we will be right back announcements margaret brennan that s it for us today thank you for watching our apologies to anthony
