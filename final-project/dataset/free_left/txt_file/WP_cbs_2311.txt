the following is a transcript of an interview with health and human services secretary alex azar that aired sunday may 17 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan elizabeth palmer in london thank you we want to go now to health and human services secretary alex azar he joins us from hhs good morning mr secretary health and human services secretary alex azar good morning margaret good to be with you again margaret brennan great to have you operation warp speed which is what the white house is calling this push to have a vaccine by the end of the year 300 million doses is the promise can you be clear here is the pledge that all 328 million americans will be able to get a shot in their arm by the end of the year sec azar well margaret let s be clear that s a goal and you know i i think the gretzky s once said that you fail to achieve 100 percent of the goals you don t set and so it s not a pledge it s a goal of what we re going to mobilize the entire u s government private sector to achieve what happened is you know these drug companies and vaccine makers they all said it s going to take this amount of time because they re using their traditional approaches you you do phase one phase two phase three trials in sequence then you do manufacturing well the president said that s not acceptable so what we re doing is wringing the inefficiency out of the development process to make the development side faster to get to safe and effective vaccines and at the same time we re gonna scale up commercial sized manufacturing margaret brennan right sec azar and produce hundreds of millions of doses at risk they may not pan out they might not prove to be safe and effective but we ll have it so we could begin administration right away margaret brennan you said hundreds of millions of doses that is not the same thing as saying hundreds of millions of vaccines ready to be administered to the american public you said this week that the entire american population could receive vaccines by january that s the goal can you sec azar that s a margaret brennan can you clarify sec azar that s it hundred hundreds of millions we have hundreds of millions of people so 300 million is the goal and by january that we would set whether by one or multiple vaccine candidates to be able to have let s let s focus our energies margaret brennan so is this is this sec azar on actually getting those vaccines developed at this point margaret brennan absolutely i just want to set expectations for the american people because clearly you re going to have a lot of people wanting this vaccine will it require booster shots are you sure 2 300 million doses is sufficient sec azar well those are great questions margaret that s actually going to be part of the development programs that you study is do is it a single shot do you have a multiple with a booster or what type of immune response do you get your that s why you don t go into battle with just one target here so we had a hundred candidates originally we ve narrowed it to 14 and we re going to keep narrowing that down to maybe four or five six that we really place the big financial bets behind and drive on and we might actually have multiple vaccines some appropriate for different populations and different settings as we as we see the data get generated here margaret brennan president trump said on monday we have prevailed on that same day may 11th all 12 of the different models that the cdc uses projected that there will be over 100 000 deaths by june 1st how can the administration say we ve prevailed when you see a death rate climbing like that sec azar well margaret as as you ll remember the president clarified that in response to a question that by prevailed he meant with regard to testing by building a really novel comprehensive private public sector diagnostic system here in the united states he did not mean the disease burden here and he actually i think clarified that you could never speak of prevailing or or success when there s even a single death every death is tragic the disease burden here is here and across the world has been has been horrible we ve worked to minimize that we believe that our actions to delay and and and flatten the curve saved hundreds of thousands of lives that otherwise could have been lost but but that s still nothing to revel in in terms of any loss of life is tragic for the president or for any of us in the public health world absolutely margaret brennan but given that some of the states are starting to reopen parts of their economy and there s a lag time of sometimes two to three weeks before you see the virus show up how how much of a sense do you have about whether reopening is reinfecting the populace at large sec azar well these will be really important questions margaret for us to study through our comprehensive surveillance system so that s why a critical part of reopening has been influenza like illness surveillance and other hospital admission surveillance as well as syndromic testing of asymptomatic individuals especially in high risk communities and that s actually what s going to be really helpful with this federal system and the approach the president s taking of having each state taking a localized decision it s going to give us really good data you know georgia margaret brennan so we don t know what risk of reopening in other words just yet but you are going to be monitoring it is what you re saying sec azar we certainly we certainly will be monitoring but we ve seen some initial instances of states like georgia that have reopened florida that s reopening that we have not seen but again it s still early days we think the tools are there and it s also important to remember you know this gets set up as a health versus economy kind of conflict margaret brennan right sec azar it s actually health versus health we see we see suicidality we see reduction in cardiac procedures cancer screenings pediatric vaccinations there is a real a very real health consequence to these shutdowns that must be balanced against as we as we try to reopen this economy and move forward margaret brennan absolutely whistleblower dr rick bright is going to appear on 60 minutes tonight he specifically names you in his complaint as having downplayed the catastrophic threat the last time that you were with us here on face the nation was march 1st and at that time you told me what your viewers need to know is the risk to the average americans remain low do you stand by that i mean do you take responsibility for any missteps you might have sec azar so margaret brennan taken sec azar so margaret i think if we found the entire clip because i was using words only that dr fauci dr redfield dr schuchat dr messonnier would tell me to say and would repeat publicly also i believe what i said is the risk to the average american at this time remains low but that could change rapidly we always were i was always focused on warning that the situation could change that at the moment the risk was low to any individual american margaret brennan right sec azar so i stand by that in the sense that that s what the public health people were i don t make this stuff up i go with what fauci and redfield and schuchat and messonnier and others say because they re the public health experts margaret brennan certain certainly but they report up to you the cdc has been blamed for failure and mistakes with testing do you take responsibility for that sec azar so we were confronting a situation here that s completely novel there has never been a national immediate testing regime across public and private sectors we have had to literally build this from the ground up margaret that s what some folks don t quite understand here is that the cdc s role is to develop an initial fairly low throughput public health test that health labs will will do for initial diagnosis but then we count on the private sector actually to scale up these high throughput large test capacities and that s what we ve done in historic time you know these tests normally would take margaret brennan so so you don t sec azar six to nine months to get margaret brennan take responsibility for any problems that the cdc has admitted to having had sec azar we you know what did the what problem did the cdc have the cdc had an issue as they scaled up manufacturing of tests to get them out to about 90 public health labs there was apparently a contamination at an end stage there on the third part of the reagent that never led to false negatives or false positives but that prevented some of the scale up for a couple of weeks but that was never going to be the backbone of testing of broad mass testing in the united states margaret that depends on the companies like abbott and roche and thermo fisher margaret brennan well your your colleague sec azar for these high throughput tests margaret brennan i just want to clarify because your colleague peter navarro has said that the cdc let the country down sec azar well margaret brennan given the cdc reports up to you sec azar i margaret brennan do you take responsibility for that what do you think about that sec azar i don t believe the cdc let this country down i believe the cdc serves an important public health role and what was always critical was to get the private sector to the table margaret brennan all right mr secretary thank you for your time sec azar thank you margaret margaret brennan face the nation will be right back with the speaker of the house nancy pelosi stay with us a portion of this interview was cut for time here is the transcription of that exchange margaret brennan you re a father you have a high school and college age kid do you feel confident sending them back to school in the fall will you do that sec azar i will feel confident and here s the reason because we re following a very measured plan which is comprehensive testing across the country so first we do surveillance for influenza like illness and hospital admissions to look for any early indicators anybody who s symptomatic needs to be tested we have the capacity and capability for that we do asymptomatic syndromic testing to see if we have undiscovered illness in core populations of congregate living schools senior care prisons meat packing facilities we then surgeon with containment approaches we now with testing have an average of nine percent positivity in the united states and what the public health experts say is you re doing adequate testing if you re at 10 percent or below margaret brennan so you are confident sec azar and so we re driving towards that margaret brennan in of the guidance that you have provided to schools at this point and you can tell american parents they should be confident sending their kids back sec azar well it ll depend on the ground situation in any locality that s the key to this margaret margaret brennan ok sec azar the circumstances in des moines margaret may be different than the circumstances in new york city margaret brennan understood sec azar and that s why we defer to locally
