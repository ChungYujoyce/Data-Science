shaped rock and roll hall of fame has died at age 102 pei s death was confirmed thursday to the associated press by marc diamond a spokesman for the architect s new york firm pei cobb freed partners one of pei s sons li chung pei told the new york times his father had died early thursday in his manhattan home pei s works ranged from the trapezoidal addition to the national gallery of art in washington d c to the chiseled towers of the national center of atmospheric research that blend in with the reddish mountains in boulder colorado his buildings added elegance to landscapes worldwide with their powerful geometric shapes and grand spaces among them are the striking steel and glass bank of china skyscraper in hong kong and the fragrant hill hotel near beijing his work spanned decades starting in the late 1940s and continuing through the new millennium two of his last major projects the museum of islamic art located on an artificial island just off the waterfront in doha qatar and the macau science center in china opened in 2008 and 2009 pei painstakingly researched each project studying its use and relating it to the environment but he also was interested in architecture as art and the effect he could create at one level my goal is simply to give people pleasure in being in a space and walking around it he said but i also think architecture can reach a level where it influences people to want to do something more with their lives that is the challenge that i find most interesting deborah berke the dean of the yale school of architecture told cbs news in a phone interview thursday night there was no doubt pei was a genius berke who met pei some time ago described him as elegant and a gracious gentleman and pointed out the importance of his earlier work including his legacy at the new college of florida in sarasota where he designed the original three clusters of dormitories in the 1960s they were beautiful regionally appropriate modern buildings berke said that illustrated early college life pei who as a schoolboy in shanghai was inspired by its building boom in the 1930s immigrated to the united states and studied architecture at the massachusetts institute of technology and harvard university he advanced from his early work of designing office buildings low income housing and mixed use complexes to a worldwide collection of museums municipal buildings and hotels he fell into a modernist style blending elegance and technology creating crisp precise buildings his big break was in 1964 when he was chosen over many prestigious architects such as louis kahn and ludwig mies van der rohe to design the john f kennedy memorial library in boston at the time jacqueline kennedy said all the candidates were excellent but pei he loves things to be beautiful the two became friends a slight unpretentious man pei developed a reputation as a skilled diplomat persuading clients to spend the money for his grand scale projects and working with a cast of engineers and developers some of his designs were met with much controversy such as the 71 foot faceted glass pyramid in the courtyard of the louvre museum in paris french president francois mitterrand who personally selected pei to oversee the decaying overcrowded museum s renovation endured a barrage of criticism when he unveiled the plan in 1984 many of the french vehemently opposed such a change to their symbol of their culture once a medieval fortress and then a national palace some resented that pei a foreigner was in charge but mitterrand and his supporters prevailed and the pyramid was finished in 1989 it serves as the louvre s entrance and a staircase leads visitors down to a vast light drenched lobby featuring ticket windows shops restaurants an auditorium and escalators to other parts of the vast museum all through the centuries the louvre has undergone violent change pei said the time had to be right i was confident because this was the right time another building designed by pei s firm the john hancock tower in boston had a questionable future in the early 1970s when dozens of windows cracked and popped out sending glass crashing to the sidewalks during the time the building was under construction a flurry of lawsuits followed among the john hancock mutual life insurance co the glass manufacturer and pei s firm a settlement was reached in 1981 berke called the hancock tower a handsome building that surprisingly stood the test of time no challenge seemed to be too great for pei including the rock and roll hall of fame which sits on the shore of lake erie in downtown cleveland ohio pei who admitted he was just catching up with the beatles researched the roots of rock n roll and came up with an array of contrasting shapes for the museum he topped it off with a transparent tent like structure which was open like the music he said in 1988 president ronald reagan honored him with a national medal of arts he also won the prestigious pritzker architecture prize 1983 and the american institute of architects gold medal 1979 president george h w bush awarded him the presidential medal of freedom in

ming pei was born april 26 1917 in canton china the son of a banker he later said i did not know what architecture really was in china at that time there was no difference between an architect a
