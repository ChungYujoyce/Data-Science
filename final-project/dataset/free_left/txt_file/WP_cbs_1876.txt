on this face the nation broadcast moderated by margaret brennan clickhereto browse full transcripts of face the nation margaret brennan it s sunday august 25th i m margaret brennan and this is face the nation as the u s trade war with china heats up president trump meets with world leaders in france and dismisses concerns of an economic impact back home president donald trump our country is doing really well we have horrible trade deals and i m straightening them out the biggest one by far is china margaret brennan but british prime minister boris johnson told the president we don t like tariffs boris johnson just to register a faint sheep like note of our our view on on the trade war we re in favor of trade peace margaret brennan president trump did just the opposite before leaving the u s he announced new taxes on chinese goods in response to their retaliatory tariffs the stock market plunged our guests white house economic adviser larry kudlow and trump ally south carolina senator lindsey graham woman i still have a lot of confidence in the economy man i m anxious because it s unpredictable it s very volatile margaret brennan and in a new cbs news poll americans shared their thoughts on the economy their finances and whether president trump gets the credit plus the race for president shrinks as more democrats call it quits senator amy klobuchar let s get this done and win thank you margaret brennan we ll hear from one still holding strong minnesota s senator amy klobuchar all that and political analysis of the week up next on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation today we are focusing on the economy its impact on policy and politics throughout our show you will hear from voters about what it means for them and we begin this morning with white house national economic council director larry kudlow he joins us from saint jean de luz france good morning larry larry kudlow national economic council director morning margaret thank you margaret brennan the president was asked this morning if he regretted escalating the trade war with china then the white house released a statement saying he meant to say he only regretted not raising tariffs further which is it are you escalating or de escalating larry kudlow now look actually it s neither but he didn t quite hear the question this morning but his thought was if he had any second thoughts and he said sometimes he does he would have actually raised the tariff not lower it but there is no change a five percent additional tariff on two hundred and fifty billion and then five percent additional tariff on the second tranche of three hundred billion which as you recall goes into place september 1st and then december 15th because there are a lot of consumer exclusions he is responding to the chinese action and i want to say in my judgment at least both actions were very temperate very restrained all right both countries weigh in president trump has got to defend the american economy which he has done and of course as you know our battle to stop unfair trading practices from china more on that if you wish but he s continued the drumbeat but i want to make one last point if i may the negotiations between the two great countries continue we had deputies teleconference meeting last week another one is coming up this week and the principals still expect the chinese team to come to the united states in september so both countries seem to be protecting their turf here but the talks and negotiations continue and i think that s very positive margaret brennan do you expect china to retaliate to the tariffs the president put in place on friday larry kudlow i do not i i think you know his was an action to respond to their action so i doubt whether they are going to take another step margaret brennan okay larry kudlow i have not heard their official response yet we ll have to wait and see on that margaret brennan larry in the past you you ve been very clear that you think tariffs are essentially a a tax on the american consumer and that it particularly hits low income families how do you tell americans that this is not going to spiral in a way that hurts them larry kudlow well look one point point i want to make is the economic burden of these tariffs is falling most heavily on china probably by a factor of four or five to one as far as any impact here i will argue as i have it s a very small minimal impact the burden of this thing is falling way on china and let me just add to your other question the impact for ordinary american families look consumer wages are booming consumer spending is booming margaret brennan mm hm larry kudlow actually the best performing sectors in terms of wage increase margaret blue collar workers middle income and lower income workers the bottom ten percentile is doing the best and our tax cuts have actually provided at least i don t know twenty five hundred three thousand dollars less taxes lower tax liabilities margaret brennan right larry kudlow on ordinary average american families so the net net is the tax cuts in my judgment far outweigh very small harm regarding the tariffs and look the president again he has got to defend the american economy margaret brennan sure but but larry that success you just larry kudlow chinese trading practices and ip thefts have done great damage to certain sectors of our economy margaret brennan which is why larry kudlow and the president margaret brennan which is larry kudlow is determined to defend it and change it margaret brennan which is why so many people support the idea of getting tough with china but they re worried that you re actually going to damage american businesses i m looking at statements from the retail industry leaders association just on friday mister president we implore you to end this trade war before the damage is irreversible national retail federation it s impossible for businesses to plan for the future how and where does this end larry this is the business community saying this china hasn t agreed to any concessions where does this end larry kudlow well look we we re in constant touch with all those business groups and by the way they re also saying before something really bad happens which i think is an implication nothing bad has really happened i i just want to disabuse so much of this recession talk out there it just ain t so margaret brennan right but businesses larry kudlow consumers margaret brennan you know have to plan larry kudlow employment margaret brennan for the future larry kudlow business itself is doing very well margaret brennan and confidence is a fragile thing you know that so businesses are saying larry kudlow well that s margaret brennan they re they re inhibited here larry kudlow that s fair enough but but at the same time truly thousands and thousands of businesses have implored the president to protect them against china s unfair trading practices and their ip theft and their forced technologies of transfers and their high tariffs they have implored the president to take action look he s the he s the first president in our memory margaret to go after these chinese practices which have done so much damage to the american economy and the rest of the world s economy as well he has to do it he is going to continue to do it lower trade barriers would do great margaret brennan mm hm larry kudlow great help to our economy to everybody large and small companies we have our tax cut plan which gave the retailers and so forth great benefits gave individuals and small businesses great benefits and we are looking as i said earlier last week there s a tax cut 2 0 study going under my under my aegis we re looking at something it s not immediate we re not worried about a recession margaret brennan as you heard the president said he was pulling back some because he was concerned it could be passed along to the consumer do you though based on what the president said again today do you believe that the president does have the authority to block private businesses from investing in china larry kudlow well look ultimately he does have authority it s margaret brennan how would that work larry kudlow an emergency economic power authority well it was nearly invoked regarding the mexican border crisis before the mexicans came to our rescue and they ve done a great job down at the border great job so in theory that law exists but that s not what the president said he is asking american companies to take a look take a fresh look at frankly moving out of china go in someplace else margaret brennan that takes years larry kudlow preferably coming home to america it will take years that is correct and that s why there s no immediate action here he just put that out there look i have heard him say this time and time again the couple of years i ve been working here he said it to individual businesses he said it to the big business groups he is asking them to come home come back home to america we re giving you low taxes and low regulations and an entrepreneurial environment so in a sense this is nothing new maybe the way it was phrased was a little tougher than usual but we come home come home to america this is the bass play the best place to work and live and earn and invest margaret brennan okay so to be clear the president does not believe he can block private transactions with china larry kudlow he is not intending to right now that is not his intention margaret brennan but that is still something he is thinking about larry kudlow you know i i don t even want to go down that road it s like first things first let s look straight ahead margaret brennan all right larry kudlow always good to talk to you larry kudlow thank you margaret appreciate it margaret brennan we turn now to the chairman of the senate judiciary committee south carolina senior senator lindsey graham senator good to have you here senator lindsey graham r south carolina lindseygrahamsc judiciary committee chairman thank you that was fun margaret brennan well i i want to know what you think about what larry just described there he said the president does have the authority to block private investment in china you said the other day you don t senator lindsey graham well i don t i don t margaret brennan think he does senator lindsey graham know how the statute works i think he can levy tariffs on countries that he that that are creating a national security threat to us maybe he can you know do something about exporting to countries that he believes are national security danger i don t know but if you start getting into that it s a global economy the one thing i love larry kudlow it s a global economy i am glad american companies are in china doing business because there s lot of customers what i don t like is they close off markets to the american business community in china they require you to have a chinese business partner when you do business in china and they steal all of your stuff every democrat and every republican of note has said china cheats the democrats for years have been claiming that china should be stood up to now trump is and we just got to accept the pain that comes with standing up to china how do you get china to change without creating some pain on them and us i don t know margaret brennan how much pain should people of south carolina be prepared for senator lindsey graham some consumer prices on commodities are going to go up we re now that part in the trade war where you feel price increases at walmart the president has backed off because he s worried about the christmas shopping season i d tell you mister president listen you got more bullets than they do they sell us a lot more stuff than we sell them and the goal is get them to change their behavior the chinese government the chinese army and the chinese business community are one and the same they re very mercantile you don t have these disputes among democracies but the chinese communist party runs everything in china until they feel the pain they are not going to stop they they need to change their intellectual property theft practices margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham they need to open up their markets to us they need to become a reliable trading partner rather than a mercantile system that cheats everybody out of market share margaret brennan and they a lot of people as you say support the president in that china hasn t agreed to do those things senator lindsey graham right margaret brennan up to this point senator lindsey graham and they never will until they pay a heavier price margaret brennan so you think possibly not until after the election senator lindsey graham i think margaret brennan in 2020 senator lindsey graham they re trying to wait trump out i think they ve made a calculation that our elections are right around the corner they can play this game to 2020 if trump keeps piling on i don t know if they can make it that long because the supply chain is beginning to move the more expensive it create you to produce products in china the more likely you are to relocate the supply chain which would be a death blow to the chinese economy margaret brennan mm hm that s been happening for for some time but do you because south carolina has so many auto plants in particular senator lindsey graham steel and aluminum tariffs hurt us a lot margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham but you know the steel and aluminum business has a chance of coming back china produced more steel in one year than the entire world consumed that s an unfair trade practice they should be in the wto as a developed nation not a developing nation everybody i had a bill with chuck schumer seven or eight years ago to label china a currency manipulator margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham and to put a twenty seven and a half percent tariff on every product that benefited from currency manipulation bush would never do it obama would never do it trump did it so to my democratic colleagues he s doing the things you ve been calling for all these years margaret brennan what about the threat of tariffs and this dispute with the eu that could really impact the automakers senator lindsey graham i think tariffs are tools when you look at the world tariff regime sixty seven percent of all the tariffs in the world disadvantage america there s a higher tariff on american products in the country in which we do business with india s the worst i ve been introduced a bill that allows the american president to charge the same as the country we re doing business with changes charges so like in india margaret brennan right senator lindsey graham they have a hundred percent tariff on a lot of our products either we increase tariffs on indian products or we all go to zero the goal is to go to zero margaret brennan i want to ask you about a report out this week from the congressional budget office they raised the estimate the budget deficit to now one trillion dollars for 2020 senator lindsey graham yes margaret brennan as a republican do you still believe deficits matter senator lindsey graham yeah deficits matter but they re driven by entitlement spending i don t believe defense spending is the problem with the deficit i don t believe margaret brennan from the tax cuts senator lindsey graham discretionary domestic i don t believe the tax cuts margaret brennan also were unpaid for senator lindsey graham i think the tax cuts are going to pay for themselves i believe that i think an infrastructure bill would probably pay for itself you ll never get deficits in order and out of debt and to reform medicare social security medicaid margaret brennan i want to ask you about afghanistan senator lindsey graham yes margaret brennan i know you have been tracking these peace talks that senator lindsey graham mm hm right margaret brennan the trump administration is holding with the taliban there were two american service people killed in afghanistan this week senator lindsey graham yeah margaret brennan more than two thousand four hundred americans have been killed on that battlefield over senator lindsey graham right margaret brennan the past eighteen years virtually every single democrat running for president says they re going to bring the troops home senator lindsey graham yeah margaret brennan that s exact exactly what president trump is saying senator lindsey graham well i have no margaret brennan why are all of them senator lindsey graham well i think they re all wrong i think in one day we lost three thousand americans because we took our eye off the ball in afghanistan almost three thousand americans died because we ignored afghanistan to bernie sanders and elizabeth warren read the intelligence assessment by our intelligence committee as to what would happen to our homeland if we pulled out of afghanistan tomorrow mister president if you don t have a counterterrorism force left behind even if you got to deal with the taliban which i doubt but you might they don t have the capability or will to protect the american homeland every national security adviser to this president unanimously believes we need a robust counterterrorism force to make sure that isis and al qaeda do not regenerate in afghanistan to hit the american homeland margaret brennan are you concerned the president s not listening senator lindsey graham i am concerned margaret brennan to all of those advisors senator lindsey graham that the president in his desire to get out is going to make the same mistake that president obama did in iraq i don t want you to be like bernie sanders or elizabeth warren i want you to take good sound military advice mister president lowering the cost of this war is a noble endeavor we ve lost fourteen soldiers this year god bless them all but they re an insurance policy against another 9 11 they act as a virtual wall against isis and al qaeda you may get a peace deal with the taliban but you ll never get a peace deal with al qaeda or and isis they have an intent to strike america they just don t have the capability yet if we leave and outsource our national security to the taliban that they re going to take care of al qaeda and isis margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham that would be a disastrous decision and when you re on the stage with bernie elizabeth or biden i wish you d look them in the eye and say unlike you i m gonna listen to my commanders unlike you i m not going to expose the american homeland to another 9 11 because of politics margaret brennan what is that number senator lindsey graham the number margaret brennan of the forces senator lindsey graham is going to be around eighty six hundred to go below that i think would be really risky so i m going to introduce legislation requiring the secretary of defense and the secretary of state to certify to the congress that to go below eighty six hundred does not create a an additional national security risk to the homeland isis k which is the margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham afghan version of isis and al qaeda is alive and well and it s our american soldiers our intel community have the capability to protect the homeland and if you ve got to deal with the taliban eighty percent of the people in afghanistan reject the taliban margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham i hope it s an honorable deal i hope we don t throw the women back in the soccer stadiums to be shot and killed for sport i think you might get the taliban to the to the table but you ll never get isis and al qaeda to the table margaret brennan this is the one year anniversary of your good friend senator lindsey graham yeah margaret brennan john mccain s passing senator lindsey graham mm hm margaret brennan his widow cindy mccain has called for acts of civility to try to remember him is that possible anymore has the rhetoric just gotten so rough and tumble that senator lindsey graham it s a rough and tumble margaret brennan that s a past age senator lindsey graham it s a rough and tumble america but america s always been pretty rough and tumble john was a rough and tumble guy but he had the ability to to stop the fight and get results what s missing is the desire to get results i don t care what language you use i want to produce results what do i miss most about john mccain that steady understanding of the world if he were alive today he would be saying exactly what i m saying about afghanistan i know we re all tired of being over there i know it s been costly in blood and treasure but there is no way to leave afghanistan in my view honorably and safely without having a counterterrorism force with intel capability to protect the american homeland john mccain never sold false peace he never sold the illusion of peace so cindy mccain has taken over his job for the family margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham nobody was ever better taking care of in illness than cindy provided care to john she s doing a great job in her own and and human trafficking and to the four boys and three daughters they re doing doing great they miss their dad i miss him but my job is to carry on and help this president where i can and i will margaret brennan thank you very much senator senator lindsey graham thank you margaret brennan we ll be right back announcements man urbandale iowa i am concerned about a recession because i think the debt and the tariffs are eventually going to catch up woman fairfax virginia i think it s the buzzword recession first it was russia then it was racism and now its recession margaret brennan those were two voters our cbs news campaign reporter spoke to this week here to unpack more about how americans feel they are faring in the trump economy is cbs news director of elections and surveys anthony salvanto he has fresh numbers from a new cbs news poll anthony good to see you here anthony salvanto cbs news elections and surveys director salvantocbs where did you get this number thanks margaret brennan how are americans feeling after this week anthony salvanto well optimism still outweighs pessimism certainly in people s personal finances they tell us but also for the economy as a whole but then we ask people okay specifically what do you think it is that you can be optimistic or pessimistic about because look there are so many ways you can measure the economy well the number one thing they told us was the job market they think that that s in good shape that gave them reason for optimism more mixed was when they looked at the stock market that s a more closed balance of optimism and pessimism margaret brennan about half of americans own stock anthony salvanto exactly so not everybody is affected by it in fact it s only about thirteen percent of people that tell us that the stock market affects them a lot you know the president often uses that as a measure for the economy important to remember that s not always coming through to the kitchen table for everybody and then on trade policy and on world affairs both of those things people tell us they look out and they see more reason for pessimism so there is a little bit of that mix of pessimism and uncertainty still out there margaret brennan so on pessimism are people saying on the trade war that they support what president trump is doing anthony salvanto well a majority of americans feels that the american consumer will end up paying for these tariffs and the president gets lower marks on handling trade policy with china than he does for handling the economy overall but we also talked to people who are specifically involved in agriculture and jobs related to it and they are more mixed on the help and hurt balance for what this will do you know it s interesting we also asked is this something that you think you believe will work or something that you hope will work and that s really split too so i think it underpins this idea that there s a sense people want something done although maybe not necessarily specifically this margaret brennan what happens at the kitchen table what are the pocketbook issues that have people concerned anthony salvanto right when you look at what people are dealing with on a day to day basis they tell us they really see a split between the confident and the concern which is to say there are people who are confident they can pay their housing pay their their daily bills but then those who are concerned about the same sorts of things about evenly interestingly enough medical costs and medical bills are the thing that really stood out that people are more concerned about right now we even talked to about a third of people who told us that they d passed up seeing a doctor or filling a prescription because of the cost margaret brennan it s always health care always anthony salvanto it s always health care and it s always that specific element of cost so that s something that i think going forward we have to watch margaret brennan so do people hold the president accountable for these concerns or do they give him you know credit anthony salvanto well the first thing that people want to look at is where they re getting their information about the economy and that s really different today in this partisan environment we saw the clip of the woman who was talking about what the media talks about the economy margaret brennan mm hm anthony salvanto and there is a sizable number of people who feel that the media makes things about the economy sound worse than they really are but then again they margaret brennan trust factor anthony salvanto there is the trust factor but then again there is the president and a lot of people think he makes things sound better than they really are which is to say it depends on where you re getting your information now the president s job handling for the economy is still better then what we would effectively be his reelect number the number of people who say that they probably or definitely vote for him and that s about where his approval rating is so there s that but then also when you talk about the economy today you have to talk about partisanship which is to say republicans say they re better off but the ones who say they aren t better off are still voting for president trump democrats who say they are better off still said they won t vote for president trump so any time the old measures of you know it s the economy stupid or are you better off today than you were margaret brennan mm hm anthony salvanto four years ago those things kind of go out the window more and more today and it s really that partisan lens through which people view even things that might otherwise be seen as objective numbers margaret brennan so bottom line it s not as simple as saying if the economy is booming the president will be reelected anthony salvanto no it s not it s that partisan lens that really dominates today or is a major factor and that s the thing people should always watch when they talk and the punditry looking forward at this election that that partisan lens really starts to color how people look at economic numbers too margaret brennan anthony thank you very much anthony salvanto thanks margaret brennan we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan and we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan some of our stations are leaving us now but we ll be right back with minnesota s senator amy klobuchar announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we are now joined by minnesota senator and 2020 democratic presidential candidate amy klobuchar she joins us from boston good morning to you senator senator amy klobuchar d minnesota amyklobuchar 2020 democratic presidential candidate good morning margaret margaret brennan you ve said before on this program that you agree with the premise of challenging china but you do it with allies and you wouldn t use tariffs how exactly would you get them to the negotiating table senator amy klobuchar right now you have complete chaos margaret and you can use tariffs but not the way this president has been using tariffs he s been using them like a meat cleaver or maybe the better word is a tweet cleaver and when you look at what he s done just on august 1st he announced three hundred billion goods more tariffs then on august 13th they reversed it then on august 20th they said they were going to do taxes because of the fears of recession they were going to reduce taxes which of course would only add more to the debt that he s created and then the next day they reversed that and i think one common adage when you deal with the rest of the world then you want to have credibility for our great country is that you keep your promises and you keep your threats and what he does is he makes these blustering threats like kicking all of our companies out of china that people don t think really he s going to follow through on so what i would do is go back to the negotiating table with our allies examine these tariffs some of them can come off some of them could stay on and then make sure that we re using trade enforcement i had my own experience with this to keep minnesota iron ore mines open because of chinese steel dumping and at the end of the obama administration we called for and passed some laws got more enforcement going and they opened up again that is not the careful targeted approach that this president is doing and as a result you ve got soybeans sitting in bins in iowa you ve got pork down to its lowest export levels in nine years this is starting to hurt everyday americans because of the chaos that he s created margaret brennan democrats are running on this message that the economy isn t working for everyone but in this latest cbs news poll we see the majority of people say the economy is good and they approve of president trump s handling of it are democrats out of step senator amy klobuchar we re not out of step and i just know the people that i talk to they know the economy is stable and we ve come out of the downturn because of the hard work and resilience of our workers and our businesses but what a true leader does there s an old ojibwe saying that a true leader makes decisions not for this generation but for seven generations from now this president can t make keep his decision for seven minutes from now what a true leader does it says what are these challenges what do i see on the horizon we know that we ve got to do something long term about this debt and he just keeps adding to it we know we have to help people afford things like their pharmaceuticals and he has done nothing he s made a bunch of promises i would take them on it s this whole constellation of things where it s just too expensive for people to participate in this economy and then the third thing that we need to do is to simply go back to the negotiating table when it comes to the trade war that he s created and then make sure that we are doing something about this debt in the long term that s why i ve opposed so many of his policies even if you just took these corporate tax giveaways what he s done in that last tax bill you could have so much more money margaret brennan yes senator amy klobuchar to invest in people s everyday lives and infrastructure margaret brennan i want to ask you about afghanistan as commander in chief you told the new york times in your first year you would no longer have troops in that country senator lindsey graham is warning you go to zero that s reckless that risks having the country collapse into the hands of terrorists so how do you balance that senator amy klobuchar i look at it this way we have people that were now are deploying that weren t even born when we got into afghanistan so a lot of this is negotiating you know this president because of the chaos that he s created on the foreign stage makes it so our allies don t always trust him but that doesn t mean that you don t go back to the negotiating table and you try to negotiate i think you ve got to make sure that when you re dealing with the taliban that you know exactly what they re up to what s going to happen you want to make sure a lot of the gains we made with women in government and the democracy gains that we made in afghanistan stay the same but yes i think we need to start bringing our troops home margaret brennan does any footprint need to stay senator amy klobuchar you could always have training footprints and people working there ready to go if there is a complete upsurge but i think that you have to make sure that this country can function on their own and my concern right now is that if this president just keeps going back and forth on this once again margaret brennan mm hm senator amy klobuchar they ll never step up that s when been the past with afghanistan margaret brennan we saw three 2020 candidates drop out recently seth moulton one of them told the times i think it s evident this is now a three way race between biden warren and sanders and it s a debate about how far left the party should go do you feel those same pressures senator amy klobuchar no i don t feel them at all because i ve just made the debates for the fall it s like making the playoffs and it is a long haul number of our presidents that ended up being our presidents were in single digits at this point in the summer and that s because i have a different kind of campaign i am running a grassroots campaign we have great teams in new hampshire and in iowa and we re gaining support endorsements all the time margaret brennan lastly on immigration the white house said this week that they want to change the flores agreement which would allow them to detain indefinitely migrant families but do it to holding them together the obama administration also tried to get out from under the flores agreement where do you stand on this senator amy klobuchar this will end up in court and my guess is that it will be thrown out because of the way this administration has handled immigration but i think the bigger issue here margaret is that if he really wanted to do something about this he d pass comprehensive immigration reform which would be better for our economy instead of using these immigrants as pawns margaret brennan senator klobuchar thank you we ll be right back with josh bolten of the business roundtable announcements margaret brennan we re now joined by joshua bolten he is the president and ceo of the business roundtable a lobbying group that represents nearly two hundred of the world s largest companies many here in washington also remember him as former white house chief of staff to george w bush welcome to the show joshua bolten president and ceo business roundtable thanks for having me margaret brennan so you just heard the president s economic adviser larry kudlow say that the president does have the authority though he is not using it right now to essentially stop private investment in china what do corporations think when they hear that joshua bolten they get worried with that you know we don t need to go into the details of what authorities the president has but he he has a lot of authority through the national security statutes to disrupt trade and commerce in a way that would cause huge damage not just to the chinese economy but to the global economy and the u s economy so american ceos are concerned about the escalating tit for tat trade war with china margaret brennan and you saw some of that reflected in that sell off that we saw in the financial markets on friday and some concerned about what s going to be happening in the global economy we re hearing from american companies that they are worried about investing because they just don t know what s around the corner and the white house is saying trust us on this is that enough to invest on how how do corporations plan around that joshua bolten no they can t they can t plan around that i mean look it s a it s a difficult situation because the ceos of the business roundtable have been very supportive of a lot of the objectives that the administration has been pursuing in their negotiation with the chinese there need to be structural reforms to get rid of intellectual property theft to open their markets to more investment to open their markets to more u s products to stop forced technology transfer to stop subsidies to to targeted industries and all of those things are very important to have happened but if the if this trade war spirals out of control the damage is huge i i have a lot of respect for larry kudlow but he is just not reflecting the views of american business when he says this is all fine a lot of american businesses now have their foot poised above right on top of the brake and they re tapping the brake periodically what we saw on friday with the stock market was the markets tapping the brake lightly but if this spirals out of control the risk is that everybody is going to slam on the brake and that would be a disaster not just for the chinese but for the united states as well margaret brennan and what is what what is that tipping point joshua bolten we don t know where the tipping point is but but the the current situation is is sounding very risky here s here s what was most concerning about the president s tweet yesterday which was he s he s clearly trying to ratchet up the pressure on the chinese to make the kinds of accommodations we want in the trade negotiations business community supports that but the president s tweet also implied that he thinks it would be either benign or maybe even helpful for the united states to decouple completely from the chinese economy that would be a disaster not just for the chinese for the global economy and for the united states margaret brennan this is the world s second largest economy and a huge business partner joshua bolten the world s second largest economy and the biggest market for for u s and everybody else s products and a gateway to the rest of asia for u s exporters so it is it is not benign and certainly not helpful to contemplate a complete decoupling from the chinese we need to resolve the trade situation margaret brennan mm hm joshua bolten and until we do american businesses foot is going to be poised over the brake pedal tapping it periodically and hopefully not slamming on the brakes margaret brennan you you hear support for the premise not for the tactics from a lot of republicans but you also hear though a a response in some ways that this is a necessary amount of pain you also hear out there on the campaign trail a lot of complaints particularly from democratic candidates that corporations have been essentially getting the best of american workers for years president trump when he campaigned essentially said the same thing this week your organization made a change saying that your sort of premise for the responsibility of corporations is not first to profits and shareholders but essentially to their employees is this a response to these political pressures joshua bolten no it s not a response to the political pressures but it s it s a recognition of a hundred and eighty two of our ceos of some of them america s biggest companies that it s the right thing to do you know for margaret for twenty years the the business roundtable has had a policy statement that said the principal purpose of a corporation is to benefit its shareholders and what the those hundred and eighty two ceos of the roundtable did this past week is issued a statement withdrawing that previous policy statement and saying no the purpose of a corporation is to serve all of its stakeholders its customers margaret brennan mm hm joshua bolten its employees its communities and its shareholders margaret brennan and that means higher wages that means joshua bolten it it does in some margaret brennan more benefits joshua bolten ab absolutely does in some cases many of many of our companies have already raised their their minimum wages and for the first time the business roundtable supports an increase in the minimum wage but it means taking care of all of your stakeholders because in the very long run you can t take care of your shareholders unless you ve taken care of your customers employees and communities as well margaret brennan as as a republican as someone who ran the omb do you believe still that deficits matter when you see numbers like you saw this week joshua bolten yeah deficits absolutely matter now they they have not so far mattered as much as most economists or budget directors would have predicted but they definitely do matter but i i agree with with senator graham when he says that the way to attack this problem is to go after the real drivers of the unsustainable costs in our budget margaret brennan mm hm joshua bolten which is our entitlement programs you you cannot balance this budget by shrinking the economy with higher taxes margaret brennan mm hm joshua bolten and you cannot balance the budget by focusing just on the discretionary spending margaret brennan right joshua bolten which is really the a relatively small part of the problem margaret brennan josh bolten thanks for joining us joshua bolten thank you for having me margaret brennan we ll be back in a moment announcements man 1 how are things going for you financially woman 1 des moines ia they could be better yeah they could be better man 2 las vegas nv everybody i know is working it seems pretty easy to get a job man 3 charleston sc i have some issues with president trump s approach on trade i don t think tariffs work woman 2 hillsborough nh i m i m so upset by the fact that we re losing ground and our allies don t even like us nobody likes us and you know what i get it i totally get it margaret brennan for some political analysis we turn now to our panel michael graham is politics editor at insidesources and also contributor on our digital network cbsn joshua johnson is the host of npr s 1a and anne gearan is a white house correspondent for the washington post good to have you all here michael graham insidesources iammgraham good to be here margaret brennan anne does the white house have a clear message to calm the concerns anne gearan washington post agearan no and we saw that play out in in dramatic fashion all week where trump would say one thing in the morning something else in the afternoon and then by seven o clock we had three aides on the driveway or on on television cleaning it up it has continued in in france where he appeared today to say he had second thoughts about the the tariff war with china only to have aides go out and say that isn t what he meant at all so no no there s no clear message margaret brennan but when you look at the polling that we re seeing here michael it it says the majority of americans michael graham right margaret brennan do think things are going okay with the economy michael graham and i think larry kudlow tried to make the case that if you look at the economy broadly still doing well the polling you you had from cbs news shows that it s still there my question is what does a a successful economy do to voter behavior if you really believe that the economy is so good that it can survive the craziness of trump then it s so good it can survive no trump margaret brennan mm hm michael graham and it frees voters who don t like trump but really like the economy that fifty three percent to say you know what i don t have to take the craziness i this economy is so strong i can afford to vote against my economic means and and you re absolutely right the era of it s the economy stupid is over margaret brennan joshua forty five percent of those polled say they d definitely probably vote for trump so as you were just laying out there a strong economy it s not decisive in the way it used to be is the bottom line just people can t see beyond their party anymore joshua johnson npr s 1a jejohnson322 i don t know if it s that i think also if you look at that poll if you combine the people who say they will and the people who say they won t and then the people who say they won t vote within the margin of error it could go either way that s what i take from the poll i don t know that we know what to make of the economy yet there are all these different indicators that larry kudlow throws out he did it this week he did it last week in another sunday morning interview so there s all of this kind of like there s all these facts and figures flying around margaret brennan mm hm joshua johnson then you have your own personal force and you think well i can still pay my bills i can still gas the car up i m still going to work my paycheck hasn t dropped my health insurance hasn t gotten that much more expensive maybe i m okay then you ve got all these other economic things going on around the world you ve got britain now dealing with brexit prime minister boris johnson told the bbc this morning that the that it s looking touch and go in terms of having a deal and that now the ball is in the eu s court and the main thing is to prepare for a no deal brexit so the world is more complicated then you ve got president xi who s not thinking about the end of his administration he s thinking about the end of his life margaret brennan mm hm joshua johnson xi jinping will be the president of china until the day he dies and in the middle you have americans who are trying to figure out who am i going to vote for either in the primaries or in the general i am i i think it s going to come down to when people start cancelling their netflix subscriptions i mean when it when it comes down to the to the creature comforts that we have margaret brennan mm hm joshua johnson to feeling that day to day life has changed we re not there yet so i totally understand why people are kind of well maybe i like the economy i m not sure i like the fact that he tweets so much but everything seems to be okay we can t know yet there s too much going on and nothing rises to the top margaret brennan anne the other uncertainty is just what s happening in the world we saw some breaking headlines that iran s top diplomat javad zarif has made the surprise visit to the g7 what is he there for is he meeting with president trump anne gearan we don t know the answer to that it appears that one of two things is is happening either the french president who s hosting this meeting emmanuel macron has some kind of side plan for zarif to speak with with other diplomats there this may or may not in include trump and it may which brings up the other possibility which is that if if those advanced if that advanced planning does not include trump and we had not heard a word about it until an hour ago that means that macron is sandbagging trump and so stay tuned margaret brennan stay tuned we ll see to quote the president as as he said but this uncertainty does is there a political cost to the geopolitical to the economic to the financial un uncertainty michael graham obviously it affects you know the world and i think you know it s fascinating do you know who the most popular back home at the g7 summit leaders is anyone well no it s not trump that was the trick question it s actually shinzo abe but trump is number two he s the second most popular person at home not because he s obviously popular but because things people are so unpopular there s so much turmoil and change going at home imagine what it does to the global economy if there is a hard out of brexit i m we we don t even know what that is going to look like and i think trump s theory is turmoil helps me i am the candidate of turmoil more turmoil that s my team and i you know that that energizes my people margaret brennan mm hm michael graham and that s why he s more popular with the leaders of warsaw of of poland and romania than he is with england and france joshua johnson although we should be careful and i hear what you re saying but i think for the voters who put donald trump in office what some would call turmoil they would call a shake up i mean this is why donald trump got elected is because there were michael graham right joshua johnson millions of americans who said you don t see me fine i m going to punch you in the throat and make you pay attention and i m going to elect somebody who s going to do it for me for four years so the voters who are getting what they want now even those who see their economic fortune shaky but still believe in donald trump s vision for the country margaret brennan mm hm joshua johnson there is risk i think politically for democrats and even for some republicans we heard joe walsh is now going to run for the republican nomination this year telling those voters you know what now we need to fix this we need to put the right person in office you re really going to tell tens of millions of americans that i m what s wrong with the country because i put the wrong president in in office and he s doing what i want him to do just because you don t like him in the media and the press and inside the beltway are you supposed to make me feel like i am the problem now i m i m looking forward to see and when the american people start to feel what s going on and how that plays out with the voters who put donald trump in office and whether any other candidate can pull them over without shaming them margaret brennan mm hm joshua johnson for what they ve put the country through and for what they ve sent the country into i m not sure anyone s ready to do that yet margaret brennan anne the president though is feeling some pressure he s been tweeting and talking at length about what s happening with china and he s blaming the fed chair for a good part of it anne gearan he he blames china he blames the fed chair he blames he blames germany and he blames the media for mi for for misinterpreting him sometimes that order gets mixed up but those are those are the main scapegoats he clearly is feeling pressure i i think all indications are our and our reporting shows that he does firmly believe in the power of tariffs and thinks that he can wait out china the problem is that china thinks that china can wait out wait out trump margaret brennan mm hm anne gearan and yes the u s economy is larger and stronger yes trump has a lot of cards that he can play but he doesn t have a command economy the the way china does he doesn t have the the state control that that china does where they could just demand margaret brennan mm hm anne gearan that they wait him out margaret brennan we will stay tuned thanks to all of you for joining us
