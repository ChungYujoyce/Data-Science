 first read is a morning briefing from meet the press and the nbc political unit on the day s most important political stories and why they matter why trump can t escape his birther past on thursday night the washington post reported that donald trump refused again to say president obama was born in the united states i ll answer that question at the right time trump said i just don t want to answer it yet after hillary clinton seized on the issue before an audience of latinos a trump campaign spokesman issued a statement saying that obama was born in the u s having successfully obtained president obama s birth certificate when others could not mr trump believes that president obama was born in the united states senior communications adviser jason miller said and it s possible that trump tries to backtrack on his birther past at his campaign event in dc today but there s a big reason why he can t escape it no matter what he says it s a key part of his political identity indeed just look at these trump statements after obama produced his birth certificate in 2011 who knows if obama is a natural born citizen who knows who cares right now we re talking about something else ok i m going to have my own theory on obama someday i ll write a book i ll do another book that will do successfully jan 6 2016 this site is protected by recaptchaprivacy policy terms of service so for trump s campaign or even trump himself to backtrack on this birther past some 50 days before the election is like asking hillary clinton to backtrack on being married to bill clinton or bernie sanders to backtrack on being a democratic socialist or barack obama to backtrack on his fondness for abraham lincoln it is part of trump s political identity and his political following started with this it isn t true to say hillary clinton or her 08 campaign started the birther movement the other part of the trump campaign statement from last night in fact it was its beginning was pinning the birther story on hillary clinton hillary clinton s campaign first raised this issue to smear then candidate barack obama in her very nasty failed 2008 campaign for president this type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the clinton playbook but that is untrue while supporters of clinton stirred this conspiracy on the internet clinton or her campaign never said suggested insinuated that obama wasn t born in the united states as the washington post wrote last year clinton s campaign one of the most thoroughly dissected in modern history never raised questions about the future president s citizenship the idea that it did is based largely on a series of disconnected actions by supporters of clinton mostly in the months between obama s reaction to the jeremiah wright story and the democratic national convention why team trump addressing the birther story doesn t make much sense the only way trump addressing the birther story makes sense is through the logic that any day the campaign is about you is a good day besides that addressing it doesn t make sense either he doubles down on his past statements which only complicates the campaign trying to woo african americans and to seize on the deplorables controversy or he repudiates his past birther statements which raises the question if he has a political core how can you beat the birther drums for five years and then say you re sorry 50 plus days before an election if so what does he believe and what is he for one other point here with his poll numbers improving trump appears to be getting a little cocky this dr oz criticizing the african american pastor as we know hillary clinton can sometimes be a terrible frontrunner maybe trump isn t a good one as well clinton s message problem it s not enough being against trump speaking of clinton she s had a message problem since mid august it isn t enough being against trump she also to say what she s for indeed this was a problem that both mitt romney and john kerry had and look how their campaigns turned that said clinton s retooled stump speech yesterday started to get at the for issue some examples but i want you i want you to think with me for a minute about how i certainly feel lucky when i m under the weather i can afford to take a few days off millions of americans can t they either go to work sick or they lose a paycheck don t they i m running for the lgbt teenager here in north carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second class citizen i ve been involved in politics in one way or another for many years it is not an easy business it can get rough and i ve built up some defenses when it comes to public service i m better at the service part than the public part but this is why i do it and this is who i m in it for to make life better for children and families and that s what this race has always been about for me mr kasich comes to washington to talk about supporting tpp finally guess who s also in dc today answer ohio gov john kasich who is meeting with president obama to discuss promoting the tpp trade agreement friend i will be in washington d c tomorrow to participate in a bipartisan discussion at the white house about the benefits of trade for job creation innovation and improving national security he said in an email to his supporters free trade is not only a powerful driver of job creation for americans but it s also a national security issue there s no better tool for america to encourage other nations to embrace freedom and equality than healthy trade
