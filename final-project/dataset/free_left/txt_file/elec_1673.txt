the big idea cleveland you could be forgiven for wanting to pop a valium at the end of donald trump s acceptance speech last night the republican nominee painted a stark picture of a hobbesian america that is nasty brutish and short trump essentially used the most important speech of his campaign and perhaps political career to yell fire in a crowded theatre he warned that we are in a moment of crisis and made the case that these desperate times call for desperate measures while the message seem tailored tothe same disaffected and angry working class voters who fueled his primary victories he clearly wanted to convince a national audience that things are so bad right now that they should swallow whatever doubts they have to take a chance on him beginning on january 20th of 2017 safety will be restored he declared trump is the crisis candidate if voters feel safe confident and hopeful in november his team knows he will lose to win he does not just need to convince americans that the country is on the wrong track they already believe this but that we are in the midst of an existential crisis the attacks on our police and the terrorism in our cities threaten our very way of life he said repeatedly touting himself as the law and order candidate he spoke of a violent crime wave murderous illegal immigrants roaming free innocent children sacrificed on the altar of open borders and an america shocked to its core he described the current environment as more dangerous than frankly i have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen then he suggested that elites are covering up how bad things have gotten i will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper he declared trump also spoke of growing threats from outside the country after fifteen years of wars in the middle east after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost the situation is worse than it has ever been before he said this is the legacy of hillary clinton death destruction terrorism and weakness the newly minted nominee grasped for the mantle of change agent without offering many specifics a change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes he said clocking in at 76 minutes it was the longest acceptance speech at any major party convention since 1972 drawing comparisons to fidel castro yet trump never tried to be uplifting or inspiring when he s not reading from a teleprompter he can be charming and magnetic he can also be somewhat self deprecating which supporters find ingratiating but he did not try to be in this setting in a remarkable departure from past gop conventions trump made no mention of god religion or his faith philip rucker and david fahrenthold note making america afraid again is how david maraniss sums up the week the post s editorial board calls trump the candidate of the apocalypse no doubt for many of his listeners his words expressed a deeply felt emotional reality there is real fear in the land real pain but it will take real leadership not the wishful demagogic brand mr trump embodied thursday night to address this many of the claims don t hold up under scrutiny our in house fact checkers challenge the accuracy of 25 different assertions trump made last night the dark portrait of america is a compendium of doomsday stats that fall apart upon close scrutiny glenn kessler and michelle ye hee lee write numbers are taken out of context data is manipulated and sometimes the facts are wrong when facts are inconveniently positive such as rising incomes and an unemployment rate under 5 percent trump simply declines to mention them he describes an exceedingly violent nation flooded with murders when in reality the violent crime rate has been cut in half since the crack cocaine epidemic hit its peak in 1991 max ehrenfreund has more on why trump s crime stats were cherry picked and misleading read an annotated version of the full transcript here if reality does not conform to what trump needs reality to be to support his case he will invent a new reality e j dionne writes an array of key republican thought leaders expressed angst and alarm about the tenor of trump s speech here s a sampling of the reaction a speechwriter in george h w bush s white house this is a very dark and frightening speech thechief speechwriter in george w bush s white

aspirational trump speeches don t have applause lines they have boo lines a gop pollster who specializes in outreach to young people trump s message the patient is in such grave condition that the only cure possible is a highly unconventional if risky treatment a longtime john kasich confidant this is completely insane but hillary has the opportunity to be the optimistic hopeful candidate coming out of philly a conservative columnist for the houston chronicle usually there s a bit of humor in this kind of speech nada the conservative columnist at the nyt it s a testament to the comic opera side of this whole business that trump is much less effective in full strongman mode than just riffing the mainstream media was also taken aback by the gloom the financial times s u s columnist this speech is darker than a coal mine rip reagan republicanism the post s white house bureau chief this is much much darker than bob dole s 96 acceptance speech and that was pretty dark as far as these things go a culture reporter for the new york times there are norwegian death metal bands watching this speech going wow this speech is depressing cbs reporter if reagan gave the shining city on a hill speech let s dub trump s speech america the crumbling city in a ditch presidentobama s chief speechwriter from 2005 to 2013 this is trump s nightmare in america speech trump really does want to be the new nixon as promised earlier this week his speech heavily drew on and echoed richard nixon s acceptance speech at the 1968 convention i am your voice trump said saying that he will fight tirelessly for millions who have been forgotten like nixon trump is clearly motivated by profound grievance and a yearning to be shown respect by elites who have never taken him seriously he bragged at both the beginning and the end of his speech about how many votes he received in the primaries and how he proved the pundits wrong oh we love defeating those people don t we he asked the crowd i am with you i will fight for you and i will win for you sooner or later they all copy me pic twitter com zmhzw7lgvu many bristled thatthe analogy is unfairto nixon a weekly standard writer nixon was law and order but also was like harding calm reassuring commitment to normalcy https t co zjjrco6rdz a new yorker writer this is not nixon it s wallace i wonder what my dad would think of my tremendous success trump said late in the speech but he did not sketch out autobiographical details that could have made him more relatable in nixon s 1968 rnc speech for instance he spoke poignantly about being a poor boy in california listening to the train go by at night and dreaming of a better future we got nothing like that from trump perhaps because the billionaire does not have those kinds of stories to tell a textbook cult of personality trump did however present himself as a white knight who is singularly capable of restoring order nobody knows the system better than me which is why i alone can fix it he insisted i have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police he said at another point when i take the oath of office next year i will restore law and order to our country believe me believe me wonkblog s jim tankersley compares the text of trump s speech last night to reagan s speech at the gop convention in detroit in 1980 most strikingly reagan warned voters to place their faith in free people not powerful leaders trust me government asks that we concentrate our hopes and dreams on one man that we trust him to do what s best for us he said my view of government places trust not in one person or one party but in those values that transcend persons and parties the trust is where it belongs in the people in this vein post opinion blogger alexandra petri describes the final night of trump s convention as a creepy fascist infomercial donald trump is selling america a miracle juicer the juicer is donald trump it is orange and it will never let you down if you order now donald trump will send you another one free the weekly standard editor trump s i m the only one who can fix it marks descent of the republican party from republican constitutionalism to demagogic ceasarism a conservative writer rnc who made fun of yes we can for seven years are now chanting yes you will on the convention floor i alone can fix it words from a candidate that should cause all conservatives to reject him more broadly trump clearly believes in his heart that government is the solution to our problems this is of course should be anathema to intellectually honest movement conservatives and is totally at odds with 36 years of orthodoxy the political editor at buzzfeed who previously wrote for the conservative free beacon the other big thing completely absent here obviously is the idea that you don t want government in your life this is all government trump rejected other core tents of modern conservatism as well americanism not globalism will be our credo he said but trump now owns the republican party at least until november the audience cheered and applauded for a lot of lines that conservatives in the not distant past would have booed a democrat for saying he sounded protectionist and isolationist themes sure not everyone was applauding and perhaps some in the audience didn t understand what exactly he was referring to but the crowd was with him this is pat buchanan s 1992 convention speech considerably dumbed down and more important delivered by the republican party s nominee a boston globe reporter so who is providing the gop response to this speech trump s alarmism makes it imperative for democrats to offer a counter narrative next week most democrats are still far too dismissive of trump s chances they discount him at their own peril just ask jeb wherever he s hiding out this week remember bill clinton s speech at the charlotte convention in 2012 he effectively laid out the case that the economy had improved dramatically compared to what obama had inherited when he took office in jan 2009 obama himself speaks next week in philadelphia and you can bet he ll try to rebut the picture that trump painted of the economy and the country it s all over but the shouting my ears are still ringing a little bit after trump basically yelled his entire speech a lot of male pundits have taken heat for saying clinton shouts when she talks these guys ought to call out trump for doing so last night a ton of online buzz was about the yelling it s official howard beale is running for president rncincle donald trump likes to criticize hillary clinton for screaming her speeches but maybe she s taught him a thing or two texas sen john cornyn s 2014 campaign manager rncincle pic twitter com qxokvvadpj a senior editor at national review if people are worried that you are an authoritarian and demagogue better not to shout your speeches a writer for the daily show trump delivered that speech as if everyone watching just suffered a traumatic head injury how many fingers am i holding up to his credit trump again showed he can be self disciplined when he wants to be for a night normally he ad libs in response to a chanting crowd but he mostly kept chugging along and sticking to the script as the crowd chanted lock her up a mantra of this convention trump didn t take the bait let s defeat her in november he replied a few minute later a protestor to his left disrupted his speech and held up a sign that said build bridges not walls trump stood patiently if a little perturbed looking as the crowd drowned her out with chants of usa at a normal rally he d rile up the audience into a frenzy by yelling get em out of here but last night he took a dramatic pause before bellowing how great are our police the crowd loved it looking to the next 100 days many republican experts believe trump did little to expand his appeal beyond the base it may be that this speech was so unusual relentlessly negative and high decibel that it will punch through more the analysts realize national review editor rich lowry writes but it s hard to believe it s going to widen his appeal he didn t even seem interested in trying to show voters that he has more range than he is shown over the last year this was a trump rally dressed up with fancy trappings and a ballon drop afterwards surely trump s attitude is that this approach got him this far so why change and that is the gamble of his entire campaign the ohio governor schief strategist trump preaching to choir no outreach to disaffected gop dems indies no effort to build coalitions someone slipped them 1960 census a senior writer at the weekly standard any content in this speech that trump didn t use during the primary

remembered was when billionaire paypal founder peter thiel told the convention i am proud to be gay i am proud to be a republican but most of all i am proud to be an american it was the first declaration of its kind and most of the delegates stood and cheered then in his speech trump referred to the massacre of 49 wonderful americans at a gay nightclub in orlando and promised to protect our lgbtq citizens the crowd cheered trump paused as a republican i have to say it is so nice to hear you cheering he said what a sea change the official party platform ratified earlier this week continues to oppose gay marriage but the times they are a changin even the running mate trump picked to appeal to social conservatives got in on it mike pence stands and applauds trump s nod toward lgbt while you were sleeping we mayfind out hillary s v p choice this afternoon even though she is not expected to formallyannounce her choice until tomorrow the headline in the new york times is tim kaine seems likely for hillary the wall street journal says kaine seen as clinton s vp pick the ap s ken thomas and matthew barakat write that kaine 58 has been a favorite since the start the timing kaine has a series of fundraisers scheduled in massachusetts on friday and saturday if the virginia senator cancels that s a strong indication he s been picked the boston globe s annie linskey reports kaine s first fundraiser is set for noon friday at the university of massachusetts club in boston on saturday kaine is scheduled to be on nantucket at the chanticleer garden for a 5 30 pm reception text messages could go out from the campaign announcing the pick as soon as friday after an event she s holding here in orlando linskey adds clinton is appearing at the site of the pulse nightclub shooting this morning making it unlikely that a selection would be announced before then elizabeth warren does not think it s her i think if it was me i d know it by now the massachusetts senator told stephen colbert last night some democrats caution against discounting tom vilsack per john wagner and anne gearan there s a push among some lefties to prevent hrc from picking kaine or vilsack they grumble that the virginian is too close to the financial services industry and the ag secretary is too close to corporate agri business kaine signed a bipartisan letter just this monday urging the consumer financial protection bureau to carefully tailor its rulemaking regarding community banks and credit unions so as not to unduly burden these institutions with regulations aimed at commercial banks anne gearan reports at issue are compliance rules under dodd frank kaine also signed a second letter on behalf of regional banks seeking relief from liquidity reporting requirements critics say both requests help banks of many sizes avoid oversight kaine brushed thecriticisms aside people are going to say whatever they want but i m strongly for the regulation of the financial industry he told reporters in northern virginia if you spend a lot of time over regulating credit unions and community banks you are basically letting a lot of the big guys off easily kaine also said he s undecided on tpp and still open to voting for it i see much in it to like he told the intercept calling the deal an upgrade of labor standards environmental standards and intellectual property protections but he also voiced concerns about the dispute resolution mechanisms teasing reporters clinton tweeted pictures of cory booker from her official account now might be a good time to follow
