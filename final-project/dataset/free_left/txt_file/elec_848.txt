advertisement supported by transcript na by nick corasaniti and alexander burns donald j trump s candidacy has driven away throngs of republican elected officials donors and policy experts but not the national rifle association with mr trump increasingly isolated and hobbled by controversies of his own making the powerful gun rights group has emerged as one of his remaining stalwart allies in the republican coalition the institution on the right most aggressively committed to his candidacy except for the republican national committee itself the association has spent millions of dollars on television commercials for mr trump even as other republican groups have kept their checkbooks closed and mr trump s campaign has not run any ads of its own the n r a s chief political strategist chris cox gave a forceful testimonial for mr trump at the republican convention mr trump has repeatedly praised mr cox and the association s executive vice president wayne lapierre and on tuesday when mr trump roiled the presidential race anew with a rough comment his critics interpreted it as a suggestion that second amendment people could attack hillary clinton or the judges she would appoint if elected president the association rushed to defend his remark as no more than an attempt to rally gun enthusiasts to vote in november allies of mr trump and the association describe their political alliance as a marriage forged out of urgent necessity an unlikely pairing of a former gun control proponent who lives in a manhattan skyscraper with an advocacy group typically seen as speaking for gun manufacturers and the hunters and sportsmen of middle america but mr trump has effectively romanced the pro gun community with a message of fierce support for second amendment rights and the n r a spurred by concern about mrs clinton s power to name supreme court judges has reciprocated his overtures with enthusiasm helping to establish that connection have been mr trump s sons donald jr and eric avid hunters with ties to the n r a donald jr mr trump s oldest son spoke about the importance of gun rights on a visit to capitol hill in the spring on the campaign trail mr trump makes a show of embracing the association and its leadership while accusing mrs clinton of seeking to do away with the second amendment we re going to help the n r a who are great people he said on tuesday in fayetteville n c they re fighting hard they re fighting hard chris and wayne and all their people at the n r a these are people that love our country the alliance with mr trump comes at a moment of peril for the n r a and its agenda as democrats threaten to take control of the senate and polls show the public increasingly supportive of at least modest new limits on the sale and possession of firearms mrs clinton and other democrats have run explicitly against the n r a in this election attacking the gun lobby for opposing laws intended to restrict gun sales to people with mental illnesses or whose names are on the federal terrorism watch list they have held up the n r a as a uniquely sinister organization and cast themselves as opponents of the group rather than of gun owners in general transcript wncn mandatory courtesy cbs north carolina no access raleigh market fayetteville north carolina 9 august 2016 soundbite english donald trump us republican presidential nominee well i think you re talking about i m not sure because i haven t heard this question but i think you re talking about the power of people that are in favour of the second amendment and they have tremendous political power i think they really are strong they re united and in fact the national rifle association just came out and they agreed that is absolutely the way they feel too we have tremendous power the people like myself that believe in the second amendment if hillary clinton democratic presidential nominee gets elected i think she s going to decimate the second amendment if not abolish it and she ll do that through judges through the justices of the supreme court but the second amendment people have tremendous power because they re so united in her acceptance speech at the democratic convention last month mrs clinton said the country could not have a president in the pocket of the gun lobby i m not here to repeal the second amendment she told the crowd in philadelphia i m not here to take away your guns i just don t want you to be shot by someone who shouldn t have a gun in the first place mrs clinton who has campaigned with gun control advocates like the former congresswoman gabrielle giffords and her husband mark kelly told a crowd in iowa on wednesday that mr trump s provocative remark about second amendment supporters showed he was unfit to be president she called it the latest in a long line of casual comments from donald trump that cross the line the n r a is expected to intensify its efforts on mr trump s behalf association officials said increasing its spending on television commercials and wielding its extensive network of activists to help turn out voters sympathetic to mr trump the n r a has spent nearly 6 million this year on advertising supporting mr trump focusing its latest efforts on the swing states of nevada north carolina ohio and pennsylvania where mr trump and his running mate gov mike pence of indiana have been campaigning heavily that sum a tiny fraction of what has been spent on commercials backing mrs clinton is the largest expenditure for ads helping mr trump in the general election at this point in the last two presidential elections the n r a had not spent a single dollar on commercials backing the republican nominees john mccain in 2008 and mitt romney in 2012 according to the ad tracking firm kantar media cmag in 2004 the rifle association spent just 61 000 aiding president george w bush s re election bid and only in washington rebuilding america now a super pac supporting mr trump s candidacy also appears to be ramping up its activities with roughly 1 million added to its advertising plans for the next six days in four battleground states grover norquist an anti tax activist who sits on the rifle association s board said the 2016 race was uniquely explosive because control of the supreme court hangs in the balance and mrs clinton has spoken critically of judicial decisions that take a broad interpretation of the right to own guns the upshot s presidential forecast updated daily trump in his public statements in his speech at the convention is the most pro second amendment presidential candidate of either party in living memory mr norquist said and we haven t had a presidential candidate declare war on the second amendment community as aggressively as hillary mr norquist said that the n r a and other second amendment groups were determined to reach voters who are concerned about crime and self defense and who might hold permits to carry concealed weapons but were not recreational gun users like hunters and sportsmen they may not fit the conventional profile of gun owners he said and may be more likely to live in battleground states like florida michigan and pennsylvania they are more suburban mr norquist said they are more likely to be swing voters and not necessarily n r a members the n r a s ads have focused on themes of self defense and fear and on persuading gun owners that they should fear mrs clinton its latest commercial released tuesday accused her of hypocrisy saying she surrounded herself with armed guards while trying to take away americans firearms leaving them defenseless people who donated to establishment republican candidates in the primary season are more likely to give money to hillary clinton than to donald j trump at times the association has taken its advocacy for mr trump well beyond gun rights with no well funded super pac running ads for mr trump the n r a stepped into that role in late june releasing an ad on an entirely unrelated issue the commercial featured a survivor of the 2012 attack in benghazi libya criticizing mrs clinton s handling of it it made no mention of guns or any other domestic policy issue and the n r a has used its digital channels which reach more than five million members to echo mr trump s messages ginny simone a reporter for nra news the association s online channel recently offered a glowing video package showcasing mr trump s convention speech and trumpeting his support among gun owners mr trump has not always been such a clear ally of the gun lobby when he considered a bid for president in 2000 he repeatedly expressed support for a crackdown on gun ownership and criticized republicans who he said walk the n r a line and refuse even limited restrictions but this year mr trump has gone to unusual lengths to get along with the organization when the group offered rare criticism of him in june for suggesting after the nightclub massacre in orlando fla that patrons there should have been armed mr trump took the unusual step of walking back his remarks his intention he insisted had been to suggest that more armed guards at the nightclub would have been helpful
