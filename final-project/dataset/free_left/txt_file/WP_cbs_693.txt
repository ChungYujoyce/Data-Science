the following is a transcript of an interview with senator ted cruz that aired sunday october 13 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we spoke yesterday with texas republican senator ted cruz he s the highest ranking u s official to visit hong kong since pro democracy protests began four months ago we asked him about the president saying that the situation in hong kong was dying down senator ted cruz i ll tell you what s happening here in hong kong is inspiring we ve seen over two million people come to the streets standing up for freedom standing up for democracy and standing up against the oppression of the chinese communist regime and i think it is very much in the united states interest to support the people of hong kong i m here i m dressed in all black standing in solidarity with the protesters margaret brennan so the protests are not dying out as the president suggested sen cruz the protests are continuing full force and i ll tell you something that really illustrates just how powerful the protests are is is what we ve seen happen with the nba this past week daryl morey the general manager of the rockets my hometown team i m a diehard houston rockets fan but but he tweeted a very benign tweet where he said stand for freedom stand with hong kong and and the chinese communist government they just about lost it they got so upset they ended up boycotting the rockets they ended up pulling them off tv in china they ended up pulling them off the internet they ended up canceling all of their sponsorships and sadly what ended up happening is the nba as a league began this series of apologies and it was really sad to see an american company and indeed a global sports league like the nba being dragooned into censoring the free speech of american citizens in the interest of big bucks it s not complicated why the nba did that television and the chinese market is worth a whole lot of money but but thankfully a whole lot of us across the ideological spectrum indeed i helped lead a group a bipartisan group of members of congress calling on the nba to do better to defend free speech margaret brennan right sen cruz and i m proud to say i i think the nba is doing a better job of defending those free speech rights margaret brennan but isn t it really the u s government that should be leading the charge on this rather than free enterprise sen cruz well well but but listen american businesses shouldn t be in the business of censoring americans and we ve seen this pattern whether it s the nba afraid of losing a bunch of money in china or whether it s hollywood censoring out any content that is critical of the communist government in china you know it s really an unfortunate dynamic how china uses it its vast resources to promote censorship and all of our allies are facing this increased aggressiveness margaret brennan exactly sen cruz of china and we need to stand up we need defend our shared values margaret brennan exactly so should those kind of protections be in any kind of trade deal with china sen cruz well listen a trade deal is is functionally different the senate foreign relations committee just unanimously passed legislation on hong kong to pressure to pressure china to protect the free speech and democratic rights of the people of hong kong that i m a co sponsor of that legislation margaret brennan right sen ted cruz and it was bipartisan we saw republicans and democrats come together margaret brennan well you re talking about legislation there but what actions we ve seen the trump administration take about muslim minorities who are being put in internment camps in china have been by the state department sen cruz yeah margaret brennan pretty limited the commerce department blacklisted some companies how do you stop the trump administration from using that as a bargaining chip in a trade deal sen cruz i introduced legislation called the tiananmen act to that that would direct blacklisting the technology companies the chinese technology companies that china is using to engage in surveillance to engage in repression and imprisonment and torture and murder of up to a million uighurs a religious minority a and as you noted just this week the trump administration announced that they were implementing what is the core of my legislation which is blacklisting those chinese technology companies that are being used to suppress religious minorities i think that s a really good step margaret brennan have they assured you sen cruz it s a positive step margaret brennan that won t be sen cruz by the administration margaret brennan in any way considered as a bargaining chip in negotiations sen cruz well listen i think we can do both it s important to get a trade deal with china i hope we do get a trade deal with china we have enormous economic concerns but we can do that at the same time defend our core values margaret brennan so china s a a surveillance state is it appropriate for president trump to be saying sen cruz yeah margaret brennan china should look into the biden family is that appropriate sen cruz i look of course not elections in the u s should be decided by by americans and it s not the business of of foreign countries any foreign countries to be interfering in our elections margaret brennan even ukraine i mean when you re talking about some of this i mean do you think that say the president s personal attorney rudy giuliani who s been talking about china who s been talking about ukraine do you want to hear him testify about this sort of shadow foreign policy sen cruz listen foreign countries should stay out of american elections that s true for russia that s true for ukraine that s true for china that s true for all of them it should be the american people deciding elections i i don t know what rudy s been saying i i do know though that we should decide our elections it should be the american people making those decisions maragret brennan and you do want him to testify before your committee sen cruz i think it d make a lot of sense for rudy to testify before the senate judiciary committee that s that s ultimately a question for the committee chairman lindsey graham but but i d like to see rudy testify yes margaret brennan so the president is often talking about the need to look in to joe biden if he is so concerned would it be in any way appropriate for him to bring it to his own justice department instead of talking about foreign countries looking into his political rival sen cruz i have long advocated that the justice department should enforce the law should investigate corruption should investigate violations of law regardless of party margaret brennan but to be clear you re not calling for the justice department to investigate the biden family sen cruz look i don t i i believe the justice department should investigate violations of law if there s credible evidence of a violation of law yes they should investigate and i ll tell you what i have called for i think president trump wisely released the transcript of his conversation with the ukrainian government i think that was good because a lot of what the democrats had been raising alleging an illegal quid pro quo was not in fact backed up by the transcript but i think i think actually the administration should do the exact same thing for joe biden that it should release the transcripts of joe biden s conversations with ukraine use the same standard for president trump and joe biden and let the american people read the transcripts and decide margaret brennan senator cruz we will leave it there thank you for joining us from hong kong we ll be back in a moment watch cbs news anytime anywhere
