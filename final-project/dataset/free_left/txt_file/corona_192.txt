filed under they are so very offended by house speaker nancy pelosi s crack that president trump is morbidly obese but ignore his endless ugly insults with the president s stunning admission monday that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine an anti malaria drug that most medical experts say should not be used to treat or prevent coronavirus the questions tumbled out was trump lying about taking the drug he s long been touting to combat covid 19 just to own the libs was he really taking it and if so why would an actual doctor prescribe it was he putting his life on the line by taking a drug the fda cautioned against outside of hospitals and that has been linked to deaths in depth political coverage sports analysis entertainment reviews and cultural commentary but the news that trump may be on a dangerous regimen of hydroxychloroquine while refusing to much more simply wear a mask in public didn t seem to alarm his supporters a comment from speaker nancy pelosi on the other hand did he s our president she told cnn monday night and i would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists especially in his age group and in his shall we say weight group morbidly obese now the obvious reaction to this regardless of your politics is to laugh audibly and for at least a couple minutes as i did at pelosi s not so subtle dig unless of course you re a suddenly oh so sensitive team trump snowflake in which case you clutch your maga hat and cry into your chloroquine at the outrage of pelosi s fat shaming of the president the same people that lead the body positivity movement apparently feel comfortable commenting on people s weight publicly always good to remember the rules never apply to them tweeted one very hurt person i m wondering if secupp and others would find it knee slapping hilarious and i did as i mentioned if president donald trump called someone morbidly obese or would the words fat shaming be trending i want to make certain we are playing by the same rule book tweeted another concerned citizen and astute observer of the president s notable past behavior are you kidding me the earnestness with which these asking for a friend posts about the rules were written leads me to believe they are not in fact joking so as a fan of intellectual consistency myself i ll respond by saying rules where we re going we don t need rules i ll go ahead and show my work the president has referred to women over the course of his public career as dogs pigs fat ugly slobs lowlifes and horseface he has bragged about grabbing women by the genitals and has been accused by no fewer than 25 women of sexual misconduct he has attacked women journalists for doing their jobs and mused on multiple occasions that women are more suited for housework he has mocked a girl with asperger s a disabled journalist a prisoner of war a gold star family and even his own supporters he has called the media losers nasty and human scum accused one news anchor of murder suggested another was menstruating and that another was bleeding from a bad facelift he insisted former president barack obama was from kenya maligned immigrants from shithole countries said a gathering of neo nazis included some very fine people and trafficked heavily in online anti semitic tropes this needless to say is a very partial list i have a hunch trump fans are not all that offended on behalf of their insulter in chief but are just playing the part out of boredom and unfulfilled promise for some the pelosi comments finally unshackled them from the chains of common decency so that they could engage in the real fat shaming they ve long wanted to do this bich sic literally just called realdonaldtrump morbidly obese on national tv bahhhahaha this is awesome sorry liberals fat shaming is no longer an offence and any heat towards this oiled up crypt keeper is game on tweeted one emancipated reveler glad she said it cause now we can point out that lizzo is morbidly obese exclaimed another former fat shamers anonymous member is stacy abrams morbidly obese too asked a curious health fan for these fine folks pelosi apparently gave them a new lease on life for the others the trump fans who would very much like to speak to your manager about the so called rules let s talk when trump inevitably tweets out his well thought out retort to pelosi because when it comes to being offended trump fans have not a single horse faced pinky toe to stand on s e cupp is the host of s e cupp unfiltered on cnn send letters to letters suntimes com know about breaking
