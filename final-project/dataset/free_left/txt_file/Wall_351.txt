advertisement supported by it s the perfect combination of distraction fear mongering and red meat for his base by norman l eisen mr eisen served as special counsel to the house judiciary committee during the impeachment and trial of president trump in the middle of the coronavirus crisis a cratering economy and plummeting approval ratings perhaps it s not surprising to see president trump return to a favorite theme abusing the rule of law of course it s a bit of luck for mr trump too that on wednesday evidence emerged from the case against michael flynn his disgraced former national security adviser providing a new glimpse into the f b i s investigation of him to mr trump and his allies it reveals a deep state intent on taking down his administration right as it began what happened to general michael flynn a war hero should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the united states again mr trump tweeted to mr trump trumpeting about maleficent federal agents must feel like slipping on a comfortable old shoe a review of these internal f b i communications however shows none of the wrongdoing that mr trump would like to see but no matter the mischaracterization of these documents as evidence of f b i misconduct and by extension absolution of mr flynn signals that the president will escalate his abuses of power in the run up to the 2020 election the michael flynn scandal was one of the first to reveal the pattern of lawlessness that has characterized the trump administration in december 2016 mr flynn in a phone call successfully implored russia to moderate retaliation against the united states for sanctions imposed because of the attack on u s elections the conduct raised serious questions under the logan act which prohibits private parties from conducting u s foreign policy mr flynn dissembled about the call and his lies were made public exposing him to potential blackmail by russia he then lied to the f b i about it was indicted and ultimately entered a guilty plea in december 2017 for those false statements he is now seeking to withdraw that plea resulting in the release of this new material three of the pages of new material released this week show the f b i discussing at what time in their conversation with mr flynn they should warn him that lying is a crime they are balancing his rights with the need to learn the truth and assessing how to do so without rattling him far from entrapment that is standard operating procedure the fourth page of the documents consists of notes debating precisely the issues that mr trump accuses the f b i of barreling past the notes include the question of what s our goal and query whether it is truth admission or get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired given the gravity of the situation it would have been malpractice not to at least ask those questions as they prepared the f b i agents were confronted with a senior national security official who had already had a conversation with russia that raised serious legal issues and had already lied about it the notes are examining the two basic options in the situation mr flynn can tell the truth or lie with consequences flowing accordingly when the f b i has serious evidence of wrongdoing it is normal to put targets in this bind law enforcement seldom puts all its cards on the table when questioning a suspect this is not entrapment where one is induced to commit a crime rather the f b i was trying to elicit the truth of whether a crime had already been committed the alternative would be to lay out all the evidence which the notes also discuss but that would have put accountability and our national security at risk by possibly discouraging mr flynn from talking so why the fuss over the past day by mr trump echoed by his usual enablers in congress and on fox news i have spent years observing mr trump s abuse of power and attempts to obstruct investigations a recurring pattern that resulted in his impeachment and to me the answer is clear he can t help it abuse and obstruction is his standard operating procedure he is also returning to form to distract from his latest blunder his botched response to covid 19 and to provide red meat to his base as part of his re election strategy by this point in the trump presidency we can anticipate some of the specific threats that lie ahead first we should look no further than mr trump s attorney general bill barr he recently said that the russia investigation was one of the greatest travesties in american history never shy about responding to dog whistles mr barr s powers include filing or joining in a motion to set aside the guilty plea and for dismissal of the charges against mr flynn true it is baseless but so was mr barr s conclusion that the president had not obstructed justice when the mueller report established multiple instances of that offense unfortunately mr barr has found company in doing mr trump s bidding including the u s attorney for the district of connecticut john durham who is conducting a review of the origins of the russia investigation mr durham has already shown his fealty to mr trump s alternative facts startling observers when he attacked the conclusion by his own department s inspector general that early f b i steps in the trump russia investigation were properly predicated mr durham s continuing review and eventual report is a second vehicle for flynn related mischief but perhaps the greatest looming rule of law risk with respect to mr flynn comes from the president himself the mueller report suggested mr trump s willingness to dangle pardons to those who do his bidding in mr flynn s case the president has since said he is strongly considering a pardon the president has limbered up with a series of dubious pardons and commutations for malefactors or allies ranging from sheriff joe arpaio to scooter libby to gov rod blagojevich indeed it is fair to ask whether mr flynn s abandonment of cooperation with the government was motivated by the hope of obtaining similar relief so we can expect that the flynn drama will continue at this point in the trump presidency who can believe that the president will resist the temptation to put his personal interests above those of the public he did that when he said russia would be rewarded for interfering in u s elections he did it again when he fired the f b i director james comey obstructed the mueller investigation and pressured another foreign nation ukraine to interfere in our elections indeed his initial refusal to admit the seriousness of the coronavirus demonstrates that same elevation of his selfish interests in avoiding obstacles to his re election the good news is that in every prior example both our institutions and individual patriots stepped forward to respond to the harms that came out of the president s pathological selfishness and disdain for the public interest as the president continues his attacks on the rule of law in the flynn case here too there is a remedy it is one that every american has the power to administer come november norman eisen normeisen is a senior fellow at the brookings institution he served as
