saleh a prominent skeptic of the theory that an isis affiliate operates independently in afghanistan lashed out on twitter at the terrorist taliban their current or former allies or their ideological twins for attacking a maternity ward and killing mothers newborn babies and other innocent civilians evidence shows that the taliban are in a celebratory mood for massacring shiites in a maternity

taliban or isis in the recent attacks isis faction in the country which the u s has long viewed and fought as a separate enemy in afghanistan has not claimed responsibility for the carnage visiting the hospital which is run by the charity doctors without borders msf on wednesday evening president ashraf ghani said he could not tolerate the terrorist attacks and ordered the country s security forces to resume offensive operations against the taliban afghan security forces had adopted an active defense posture since a u s taliban agreement was agreed earlier this year aimed at facilitating
