million homes will be affected by coastal flooding in the next 30 years and that number could rise to 630 million by the year 2100 if carbon emissions don t decrease new estimates mean rising seas will cause more damage cost more money and impact more communities than ever before according to a study by climate central published tuesday in nature communications land housing 300 million people will flood annually by 2050 additionally high tides may permanently rise above land that is home to 150 million people by 2050 sealevelrise will push average annual coastal floods higher than land that is now home to 300 million people according to a climate central study published today in naturecomms full report on the findings at https t co ghjr5jtrca climatechange pic twitter com r6llu7aem3 the new numbers far surpass the previous estimate of 80 million sea level rise is a result of heat trapping pollution from human activities which causes ice sheets and glaciers to melt increasing the volume of water in the oceans it increases the likelihood of coastal flooding which can damage infrastructure destroy crops and threaten entire cities based on human activities sea levels could rise between about 2 and 7 feet during the 21st century or possibly even more the majority of the people affected live in asia with the greatest threats facing mainland china bangladesh india vietnam indonesia and thailand in those regions 54 million more people will be affected than previously thought bringing the total to 237 million people in the decades ahead sea level rise could disrupt economies and trigger humanitarian crises around the world climate central said indonesia is already experiencing the effects of increased flooding the government recently announced plans to move the capital city from jakarta to borneo jakarta which sits on the island java is the fastest sinking city in the world according to a press release researchers calculated coastal elevation using satellite readings the standard way to estimate sea level rise however they used artificial intelligence to account for known mistakes in previous nasa models which tended to overestimate elevation these assessments show the potential of climate change to reshape cities economies coastlines and entire global regions within our lifetimes said dr scott kulp lead author of the study as the tideline rises higher than the ground people call home nations will increasingly confront questions about whether how much and how long coastal defenses can protect them new analyses reveal that about 110 million people already live on land that falls below the current high tide line compared to the 28 million previously estimated likely protect by coastal defenses in some way 250 million people live on land below current annual flood levels compared to the 65 million previously thought and the new report is still on the optimistic side it assumes countries meet the deadline for emissions cuts outlined in the paris agreement countries are not currently on track to meet that deadline for all of the critical research that s been done on climate change and sea level projections it turns out that for most of the global coast we didn t know the height of the ground beneath our feet said dr benjamin strauss co author of the study our data improve the picture but there is still a great need for governments and aerospace companies to produce and release more accurate elevation data lives and livelihoods depend on it the world s coasts are more vulnerable to climate change than we ever thought peter girard director of communications for climate central said with all the research available on rising seas we knew surprisingly little about the height of the land beneath our feet now that we have a clearer picture of how much more land and how many more people may face severe coastal flooding in the foreseeable future we can see not only what we stand to lose but also what we have to gain by reducing emissions and avoiding the worst sea level rise projections as shocking as these findings might be there is a silver lining they give us the knowledge we need to take action in time to protect millions and to avoid the economic and political upheaval that a climate disaster on this scale could bring he said the researchers said that in a low carbon emissions scenario meaning that emissions peak by 2020 some 190 million people will have homes below projected sea levels for 2100 in a high emissions scenario meaning emissions continue to rise through the 21st century up to 640 million people will be affected a u n climate change report released in september also highlighted the severe consequences of rising waters extreme sea level events such as surges from tropical cyclones that are currently historically rare for example today s hundred year event will become common by 2100 under all emissions scenarios due to increasing global mean sea level rise the report stated under all future emissions scenarios many low lying megacities and small islands at almost all latitudes will experience such events annually by 2050 first published on october 29 2019 10 28 pm
