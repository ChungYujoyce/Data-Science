in the big picture conversation around the 2016 presidential election the major negative narratives about donald trump have tended to focus on his racism his temperament or his tendency to tell lies yet there s another important trump trait that s gotten some attention but really needs to get much more he s corrupt and in a consistent way whenever trump has been in positions of power or authority he has demonstrated a pattern of trying to enrich himself by abusing the trust others have placed in him whether it s creditors contractors charitable givers trump university students regulators or campaign donors over the past several months and indeed the past few decades reporters have unearthed many alarming stories that show this they ve reported on trump s many shady business practices his shady charity his shady fake university scam his shady campaign spending his many shady associates and last but by no means least there is trump s refusal to release tax returns or other financial information that would shed further light on his business practices associates and philanthropic undertakings now sometimes trump s abuses of trust entail breaking the law and sometimes they re within the bounds of the law and sometimes the legality of trump s actions isn t yet clear as in the case of trump university which will face a fraud trial shortly after the election and with some of the controversies around the trump foundation but the common thread is that trump screws people over to benefit himself and despite the plethora of excellent reporting on this topic many voters seem to be unaware of his troubling history here and may view him primarily as a successful businessman who says some offensive things a recent nbc news wall street journal poll for instance found that trump had a 10 point advantage over clinton on being honest and straightforward indeed he is betting his campaign on his hopes that he can frame himself as an independent outsider free of special interest influence to contrast with hillary clinton whom he has dubbed crooked but trump s record makes it crystal clear that he s more interested in rapaciously extracting what money he can and doing what he wants with little regard to laws rules or people who aren t donald trump furthermore he s repeatedly proven willing to violate norms about what sort of behavior is acceptable and ethical and most importantly of all if elected president trump would wield incredible power yet if you look at what he s done with power in the past suddenly this theme in his biography his corruption becomes among the most troubling of his many troubling qualities there are many many reasons to be concerned about a trump administration s ethics and potential to abuse power here are just a few first off the way trump has run his businesses for the past few decades should raise grave doubts about how he d run the federal government he s allegedly been willing to break rules break promises and discriminate against nonwhite people there are the hundreds of accusations that trump refused to pay contractors and workers what they were owed which the wall street journal and usa today compiled this year the actions in total paint a portrait of trump s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years usa today s steve reilly wrote in some cases the trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents draining their resources trump told reilly that if he ever didn t pay it must have been because he was unhappy with the work and recently republican consultant brian james walsh further corroborated these accusations with his own personal story true story my dad s company was stiffed by trump on a six figure telecom job in the 1980 s trump told them it would cost more to sue him next there s the housing discrimination case against him from the 1970s the department of justice alleged that trump and his father discriminated against black applicants for apartments in trump owned buildings one superintendent said he had been instructed to write c for colored on every application from a prospective black tenant and others described similar racial codes as the daily beast s gideon resnick has written the government argued that black applicants would repeatedly be told there were no vacancies in trump owned buildings but white applicants would then inquire and get offers the trumps denied the claims and fought back in court but eventually settled with no admission of guilt trump pointed out during monday s debate which is not exactly saying he was innocent then there was trump s illegal financial maneuver back in 1986 that year he tried to take over two rival casino companies by buying up their stock but the law required him to disclose his large purchases to the federal trade commission in advance and he failed to do so the matter ended up in court and he was eventually forced to pay a 750 000 penalty as a result and there s the matter of trump s alleged contacts with the mob now to be fair to the gop nominee the mafia s influence was pervasive in the new york city construction industry at the time still when reputed mobster robert libutti was a high dollar gambler at the trump plaza in atlantic city the trump plaza worked very hard indeed to keep him happy as michael isikoff of yahoo news reported and trump s reputed mob contacts didn t stop there i ve covered donald trump off and on for 27 years and in that time i ve encountered multiple threads linking trump to organized crime reporter david cay johnston wrote in politico magazine in may no other candidate for the white house this year has anything close to trump s record of repeated social and business dealings with mobsters swindlers and other crooks donald trump has a charitable family foundation to which in recent years he has given hardly any money instead raising the vast majority of its funds from others that s rather dishonest of him since he constantly claims that the foundation s donations are from his own pocketbook but the more serious problem is that he s then used several hundred thousand dollars of that foundation money in deeply questionable ways that may well have run afoul of laws against self dealing with charity money for instance in september the washington post s david fahrenthold the reporter who s absolutely owned the trump foundation beat reported that trump used 258 000 of the foundation s money to settle legal problems involving his for profit businesses again what trump seems to have done here is used other people s charity donations to get his own businesses off the hook for lawsuits which seems pretty corrupt the trump campaign sent out a statement that attacked fahrenthold but did not dispute any facts in his story and eventually farenthold found another bombshell businessman richard ebers bought almost 1 9 million worth of goods and services from trump or his businesses but he was told to pay trump s tax exempt foundation instead according to fahrenthold s sources but according to the law trump should have paid taxes on that money as income and his campaign refuses to say whether he did so and those are just the latest trump foundation controversies fahrenthold has also reported on an illegal 25 000 donation the foundation made to florida attorney general pam bondi s political group around the time she was weighing whether to investigate trump university for which the foundation was hit with an irs penalty the trump campaign claims this was a mistake there was also that time trump spent 12 000 of the foundation s money to buy a football helmet autographed by tim tebow plus a jersey at a charity auction and much more law professor adam chodorow writes in slate writes that all this together seems to indicate trump is using his tax exempt charity as a personal piggy bank he continues that the foundation should likely lose its tax exempt status and trump arguably should report the money it spent on his behalf as income adding if i worked at the internal revenue service i would refer trump to the justice department for a criminal investigation another law professor philip hackney makes a similar argument at the surly subgroup blog repeatedly during the campaign trump has admitted that he has been greedy in business but he s argued that as president he would channel that trait to benefit the american people i want to grab all that money i m going to be greedy for the united states he s said it s a dubious claim made even more dubious by his behavior in the matter of trump university this was the gop nominee s seminar business that purported to be able to teach its students secrets of real estate investing former students sued trump claiming they were bilked out of their money and he s set to face a trial for fraud in the matter shortly after the election the new york attorney general s office has also sued claiming trump university made deceptive claims the instructors were unqualified people posing as donald trump s right hand men jason nicholas a former employee said in one deposition they were teaching methods that were unethical and they had had little to no experience flipping properties or doing real estate deals it was a fa ade a total lie the business model was apparently to try to hook the gullible with a free seminar and pressure them into signing up for more and more expensive installments that promised to teach students how to invest in real estate but these classes were apparently worthless to my knowledge not a single consumer who paid for a trump university seminar program went on to successfully invest in real estate based upon the techniques that were taught former employee ronald schnackenberg said in another deposition read libby nelson for more every major party nominee in the past three decades has released his or her tax returns but donald trump is still refusing to do so and is giving a nonsensical justification for it trump says he won t release his returns because he s currently under an irs audit but as the irs has confirmed being audited doesn t mean he has to keep his returns secret furthermore trump has many previous years of tax returns that are no longer being audited that he could release but he refuses to so there has naturally been a lot of speculation on what trump is trying to hide here do the returns show he s not as rich as he says he is that he s given far less to charity than he claims that he d rarely even paid taxes that he has a lot of money offshore how much tax is trump paying or sheltering domestically vs in foreign jurisdictions that needs to be known to ascertain which nations trump has financial ties to and where he may be susceptible to pressure richard painter and norm eisen write at the washington post until trump releases his returns we won t know as of august the trump campaign had allotted 7 percent of its total spending so far more than 8 2 million to companies owned by trump or his children according to an analysis by politico s ken vogel payments went to various trump venues an aviation company trump owns trump tower for office space his corporate staff and various other vendors now it s not as if trump should have donated his company s stuff for free indeed that would have been a prohibited corporate contribution and the trump campaign tends to respond by emphasizing that trump put 54 million of his own money into the campaign still he has deliberately chosen to spend his campaign money which includes millions raised from other people on companies he or his children own rather than on independent vendors meanwhile taxpayers are chipping in too the us secret service has paid 1 6 million to travel on a plane operated by one of trump s companies according to another report by vogel and isaac arnsdorf again secret service reimbursement to a campaign for travel is common but as the authors write since trump owns the aviation company the government is effectively paying him and about that trump tower rent shortly after the trump campaign shifted from a largely self funded model to one more reliant on donors trump nearly quintupled the rent that trump tower was charging the campaign for office space according to the huffington post s s v d te this came at a time when the campaign didn t expand its staff size though trump s team later told cnn that they were paying for two new floors in anticipation of more staff throughout the campaign trump has claimed not only that he would be an excellent president but that he d be excellent at hiring i m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people he said last year instead he has surrounded himself with people who ve not only demonstrated a history of unethical behavior but also abused their past power often to try to intimidate critics or opponents trump appointed new jersey gov chris christie to head his transition giving him a key role in recommending candidates for hundreds if not thousands of federal jobs yet two of christie s job appointees in new jersey are currently facing trial for their involvement in the bridgegate scandal prosecutors say they conspired to cause a serious traffic jam in fort lee new jersey to punish the town s mayor for refusing to endorse christie s reelection campaign another aide david wildstein has already pled guilty in the matter furthermore prosecutors also asserted in court in september and wildstein testified that christie knew about both his aides actions and their motivations while the scheme was being carried out christie has long denied this wildstein tesitfied that he bragged to christie about what he was doing when he saw him at an event and that christie laughed and responded with jokes craziest of all donald trump himself has long said that christie totally knew about his aides actions in bridgegate yet this suspicion that christie was fine with his aides abuse of power in a petty revenge plot seems to have been no obstacle for trump in his determination that christie is the best qualified person to help him staff the federal government another current trump adviser is roger ailes who was pushed out of his job as ceo of fox news just in july over allegations that he sexually harassed multiple women which if true is clearly an abuse of power ailes denied the allegations but some of his harassing comments were caught on tape according to new york magazine s gabriel sherman and fox settled with accuser gretchen carlson for the hefty sum of 20 million furthermore while at fox news ailes also used company money to try to orchestrate smear campaigns against journalists from other outlets who were reporting on him yet according to buzzfeed news s mckay coppins ailes is playing a much larger backstage role in handling trump than most people realize and then there is jared kushner trump s son in law who by some accounts has effectively been running the trump campaign for a few months kushner is a real estate heir who took over his father s company after his father was sent to prison for tax evasion making illegal campaign contributions and witness tampering when kushner s holdings ran into some financial trouble in the wake of the economic crisis he asked fellow mogul richard mack for a write down on a loan mack had extended him but mack refused not long afterward kushner apparently wanted revenge on mack and he sought to get it by using the newspaper he owned the new york observer kushner had heard a rumor about mack and he wanted his reporters to publish a story about it there s a guy named richard mack and we ve got to get this guy kushner told one reporter according to esquire s vicky ward reporters were put on the case and failed to corroborate the rumor but kushner kept pushing to move the story forward anyway as the observer s then editor elizabeth spiers recounts it never saw the light of day but it s deeply concerning about how kushner operates what s most troubling of all though is that trump is surely aware of everything i ve mentioned in this section but doesn t seem to mind he puts a man whose appointees are facing trial in charge of government appointments he invites an alleged serial sexual harasser who tries to intimidate critical journalists to be a key adviser this should set off alarm bells americans pride themselves on our politicians respect for the rule of law on the checks and balances that protect us from the powerful ezra klein wrote earlier this year but as often as not our real protection is found not in laws but in norms and that s the deeper problem underlying all this that trump has repeatedly shown he has little respect for norms of ethical or acceptable behavior there s been much discussion about how trump has repeatedly violated political norms of acceptable behavior with his proposed muslim ban his constant vicious attacks on critics his attempts to discredit a judge because he happens to be mexican american and countless other actions but his decades long track record in the business sector and the nonprofit world and his management of his current campaign suggests he s willing to violate ethical norms too he treats rules or laws as inconveniences he ignores conflicts of interest he takes what he wants regardless of who gets hurt and all this is when he is simply a wealthy businessman yet if trump wins in november he becomes the most powerful person in the world with a nuclear arsenal the us military and thousands of government appointees who can carry out his wishes at his disposal no one can say for sure what will happen then but we can t say we weren t warned get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
