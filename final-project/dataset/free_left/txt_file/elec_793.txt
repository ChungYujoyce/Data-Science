 2016 both look likely to notch new york victories but only big margin wins will help them reach their objectives by eli stokols and annie karni 04 19 2016 05 21 am edt donald trump applauds as he waits to speak at a campaign rally on april 17 in staten island ap photo new york donald trump owns new york so does hillary clinton and strong showings in tuesday s empire state primary by the republican and democratic front runners could go a long way in helping them close the sale on the nominations of their respective parties advertisement but simply winning won t be enough for either of them clinton who can t seem to shake bernie sanders even as she inches closer to becoming the presumptive democratic nominee could deliver an emphatic message if she wins by a decisive enough margin 8 to 10 points should be enough after a string of recent defeats there s this perception that the people want sanders but the party wants clinton said david birdsell dean of the baruch college school of public affairs in manhattan if she wins by a margin of six figures high five figures in new york you have a significant rebuttal to that that s an important argument for her and allows her to go into the subsequent states and she ll go into those places with more confidence and projecting beyond the convention that doesn t seem merely dismissive of the sanders candidacy trump with the gop primary now a war of attrition with ted cruz for every single delegate is hoping to take no fewer than 85 of the 95 delegates at play if he comes close to that cruz will likely be mathematically eliminated from being able to clinch the nomination outright but because trump must take 50 percent of the vote in every congressional district in order to sweep the three delegates that are up for grabs in each he too has little margin for error as he fights to reach the 1 237 delegate threshold to deliver him the nomination on the first ballot trump has spent much of the week leading up to tuesday s primary attempting to harden his support in the few regions where it is relatively soft namely in central new york around syracuse where he rallied supporters saturday donald trump is not going to get over 50 percent said sam nunberg who worked as trump s political director until last summer when he was fired and now supports cruz he s not going to win all 95 delegates the net amount is going to be very small and it s going to further the fact that he won t be the nominee i have the utmost respect for newly hired trump strategist paul manafort but it s too little too late the titanic isn t sinking it s already sunk trump s campaign which has been caught flat footed by the delegate process playing out at state assemblies in recent weeks is brushing off such concerns during the two weeks between trump s double digit defeat in wisconsin and tuesday s primary in new york that rare state in which he has a robust organization in place manafort has hired several experienced operatives in an effort to steady the campaign as it sails into deeper waters and he is looking to turn the page on a rough patch with a big win in new york that will give him added momentum heading into five contests a week later in states up and down the acela corridor in which he already holds double digit leads this whole discussion of how many delegates donald trump has is without value if we get 1 090 or 1 150 or whatever by the end of this we re going to find the other 100 or 150 delegates we need said a strategist inside trump s operation we ll go pickpocket them at the end of all of this donald trump is going to come into cleveland with 1 237 and the party is just going to have to deal with it while new york hasn t seen a competitive gop primary in 40 years the hard fought democratic contest is also unusual it s been 24 years since the new york primary mattered in the democratic race back when bill clinton needed a win over paul tsongas to help lock up the nomination now the state has turned into a high stakes battle between two new yorkers one a native brooklynite the other a former new york senator with deep personal ties to the state the stakes are potentially higher for sanders whose rationale for carrying on with his campaign will shrink if he loses to clinton here by a wide double digit margin his increasing personal attacks against clinton in recent weeks indicate how much is on the line for him and how hard he is willing to fight to keep going for clinton a single digit victory in the state that elected her twice to the senate and where she beat barack obama by 17 points in 2008 would signal vulnerabilities bernie sanders needs to continue momentum from the various caucuses that he s won said veteran new york democratic strategist george arzt who served as press secretary under mayor ed koch he needs to get under 10 points he could claim victory if he s in single digits even a moral victory however could suffer from a problem of too little too late when you re in the seventh inning and you re behind and you re claiming a moral victory it s rather tough said arzt you only got two innings to go and you ve got to do well but this is her adopted state so she s got to do better than winning by 10 points it would show a vulnerability that her campaign doesn t have the fervor of bernie s part of the high stakes battle here has to do with the heightened media scrutiny it s a homecoming not only for sanders and clinton but also for a large number of media representatives who have followed the candidates across the country and are based here the national media based in new york turn local concerns into national news said democratic consultant stu loeser who worked as press secretary for former mayor michael bloomberg it makes a primary here take on outsize importance more than a primary in pennsylvania new jersey or california for example sanders 27 000 person rally in washington square park wouldn t resonate the same way if he filled up rittenhouse square in philadelphia loeser said this is not just the candidate s hometown it s almost all of the national media s hometown that rally underscored sanders deep populist appeal and the lack of similar enthusiasm for clinton and yet clinton is still standing and likely on her way to winning her party s nomination on the republican side tuesday s results in new york and those in every contest remaining on the calendar will serve notice that the gop establishment s preferred standard bearers those who might have been most competitive come fall are long gone whichever one wins cruz or trump it s not a good outcome either way said curt anderson a republican strategist in washington if trump goes into cleveland a little short and doesn t make it and cruz is the nominee cruz is not a popular person with the general electorate and you ll have an infuriated group of voters who feel like trump got screwed and if trump s the nominee we know what his numbers are so i m just not sure how much any of it matters the thing that s really maddening about it is that hillary isn t that hard to beat anderson continued she s just hard to beat with our guys that s just galling she s going to go into the general election underwater 10 15 points and she s going to be the favorite by katie glueck photo gallery by diana d abruzzo by brianna gurciullo missing out on the latest scoops sign
