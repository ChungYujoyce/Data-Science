 lowell mass donald trump said in an interview that rival ted cruz s canadian birthplace was a very precarious issue that could make the senator from texas vulnerable if he became the republican presidential nominee republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years that d be a big problem trump said when asked about the topic it d be a very precarious one for republicans because he d be running and the courts may take a long time to make a decision you don t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head trump added i d hate to see something like that get in his way but a lot of people are talking about it and i know that even some states are looking at it very strongly the fact that he was born in canada and he has had a double passport cruz responded to trump s comments on twitter later tuesday evening by referring to an iconic episode of the sitcom happy days in which the character fonzie jumps over a shark on water skis the image has become a symbol of something shopworn and overdone trump s remarks part of a backstage interview before a rally here monday night come as cruz is rising as a serious threat in the presidential campaign especially in iowa where some polls have shown cruz eclipsing the billionaire mogul the two have had a cordial and at times even friendly relationship over the past year but they are competing intensely for the support of conservatives as the feb 1 iowa caucuses draw near there have been recent signs of tension at a rally last month in iowa trump told voters of cruz just remember this you ve got to remember in all fairness to the best of my knowledge not too many evangelicals come out of cuba okay just remember that just remember in the interview with the washington post trump said he was providing a candid assessment of his leading opponent rather than initiating a personal attack and reviving the birther debate that he once led against president obama he repeatedly said he is hearing chatter on the topic among voices on the right people are bringing it up he said trump has veered from shrugging off the issue to raising more questions himself in an interview with abc news in september trump said he did not think cruz s birthplace was an issue i hear it was checked out by every attorney and every which way and i understand ted is in fine shape he said but months earlier in iowa trump told reporters that it could be a difficult problem he s a friend of mine i have great respect for him certainly it s a stumbling block and he s going to have to have it solved before he goes too far trump said according to the dallas morning news speaking late tuesday in sioux center iowa cruz laughed off questions about trump s comment saying he would let his campaign s happy days tweet speak for itself when pressed cruz turned it back to the media saying the focus should be on substantive issues and one of the things that the media loves to do is gaze at their navels for hours on end by a tweet from donald trump or from me or from anybody else who cares he said when asked why he would tweet a video clip he said why do it because the best way to respond to this kind of attack is to laugh it off and move on to the issues that matter despite this cruz maintains he still likes trump and doesn t intend to throw insults the constitution requires a president to be a natural born citizen anyone born to a u s citizen is granted citizenship under u s law regardless of where the birth takes place as long as the citizen parent has resided in the united states or its territories for a certain period of time at the time of cruz s birth the required period was at least 10 years including five years after the age of 14 cruz s mother was a u s citizen when he was born in calgary in 1970 his father was born in cuba cruz has long said that because his mother is a citizen by birth he is one as well and fits under the definition of a natural born citizen since his election to the senate cruz has released his birth certificate and renounced his canadian citizenship legal scholars agree that cruz meets the constitution s natural born citizenship requirement though it is untested in the courts several previous presidential candidates have run for office with similar backgrounds such as sen john mccain ariz the 2008 republican nominee who was born in the panama canal zone to u s citizens in the interview trump alluded to an ongoing lawsuit in vermont where a man is trying to keep three republican presidential candidates including cruz off the ballot according to the rutland herald the lawsuit names state officials as defendants trump has long flirted with birtherism questioning obama s love of country and legal claim to the presidency he supported efforts to investigate obama s birth in hawaii and often suggested that the president was born outside the country trump s crusade reached its zenith in 2011 when obama felt obliged to publicly release his long form birth certificate the president then mocked trump over the issue at the white house correspondents association dinner that year since then trump has quieted his speculation about obama s birth while still declining to accept obama s legitimacy as president katie zezima in sioux center iowa contributed to this report katie
