trump to read it aloud trump may not have realized it yet but he had walked into a trap peter you re a real loser trump began reading the mogul had sent the note to a reporter objecting to a story that said trump owned a small minority stake in a manhattan real estate project trump insisted that the word small was incorrect trump continued reading i wrote is 50percent small this note was intended to indicate that you had a 50percent stake in the project correct said the lawyer that s correct trump said for the first of many times that day trump was about to be caught saying something that wasn t true i own 30 percent trump admitted it was a mid december morning in 2007 the start of an interrogation unlike anything else in the public record of trump s life trump had brought it on himself he had sued a reporter accusing him of being reckless and dishonest in a book that raised questions about trump s net worth the reporter s attorneys turned the tables and brought trump in for a deposition for two straight days they asked trump question after question that touched on the same theme trump s honesty the lawyers confronted the mogul with his past statements and with his company s internal documents which often showed those statements had been incorrect or invented the lawyers were relentless trump the bigger than life mogul was vulnerable cornered out prepared and under oath thirty times they caught him trump had misstated sales at his condo buildings inflated the price of membership at one of his golf clubs overstated the depth of his past debts and the number of his employees that deposition 170 transcribed pages offers extraordinary insights into trump s relationship with the truth trump s falsehoods were unstrategic needless highly specific easy to disprove when caught trump sometimes blamed others for the error or explained that the untrue thing really was true in his mind because he saw the situation more positively than others did have you ever lied in public statements about your properties the lawyer asked i try and be truthful trump said i m no different from a politician running for office you always want to put the best foot forward in his presidential campaign trump has sought to make his truth telling a selling point he nicknamed his main republican opponent lyin ted cruz he called his democratic opponent hillary clinton a pathological liar in a recent twitter message i will present the facts plainly and honestly he said in the opening of his speech at the republican national convention we cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore trump has had a habit of telling demonstrable untruths during his presidential campaign the washington post s fact checker has awarded him four pinocchios the maximum a statement can receive 39 times since he announced his bid last summer in many cases his statements echo those in the 2007 deposition they are specific checkable and wrong trump said he opposed the iraq war at the start he didn t he said he d never mocked a disabled new york times reporter he had trump also said the national football league had sent him a letter objecting to a presidential debate that was scheduled for the same time as a football game it hadn t last week trump claimed that he had seen footage taken at a top secret location and released by the iranian government showing a plane unloading a large amount of cash to iran from the u s government he hadn t trump later conceded he d been mistaken he d seen tv news video that showed a plane during a prisoner release but even under the spotlight of this campaign trump has never had an experience quite like this deposition on dec 19 and 20 2007 he was trapped in a room with his own prior statements and three high powered lawyers a very clear and visible side effect of my lawyers questioning of trump is that he was revealed as a routine and habitual fabulist said timothy l o brien the author trump had sued the washington post sent the trump campaign a detailed list of questions about this deposition listing all the times when trump seemed to have been caught in a false or unsupported statement the post asked trump whether he wanted to challenge any of those findings and whether he had felt regret when confronted with them he did not answer those questions in 2005 o brien then a reporter for the new york times had published a book called trump nation the art of being the donald in the book o brien cited people who questioned a claim at the bedrock of trump s identity that his net worth was more than 5billion o brien said he had spoken to three people who estimated that the figure was between 150million and 250million trump sued he later told the post that he intended to hurt o brien whom he called a lowlife sleazebag i didn t read the book to be honest with you i never read it i saw some of the things they said trump said later i said go sue him it will cost him a lot of money by filing suit trump hadn t just opened himself up to questioning he had opened a door into the opaque and secretive company he ran o brien s attorneys included mary jo white now the chair of the securities and exchange commission and andrew ceresney now the sec s director of enforcement the lawsuit had given them the power to request that trump turn over internal company documents and they used it they arrived at the deposition having already identified where trump s public statements hadn t matched the private truth the questions began with that handwritten note and the 50percent stake that wasn t 50percent the 30percent equates to much more than 30 percent trump explained his reasoning was that he had not been required to put up money at the outset so his 30percent share seemed more valuable are you saying that the real estate community would interpret your interest to be 50percent even though in limited partnership agreements it s 30percent ceresney asked smart people would trump said smart people smart people would say it s much more than 30percent trump i got more than a million dollars because they have tremendous promotion expenses to my advantage in other words they promote which has great value through billboards through newspapers through radio i think through television yeah through television and they spend again i d have to ask them but i bet they spend at least a million or two million or maybe even more than that on promoting donald trump lawyer but how much of the payments were cash trump approximately 400 000 lawyer so when you say publicly that you got paid more than a million dollars you re including in that sum the promotional expenses that they pay trump oh absolutely yes that has a great value it has a great value to me lawyer do you actually say that when you say you got paid more than a million dollars publicly trump i don t break it down on to the next one i was paid more than a million dollars trump said when ceresney asked how much he d been paid for a speech in 2005 at new york city s learning annex a continuing education center ceresney was ready but how much of the payments were cash approximately 400 000 trump said trump said his personal math included the intangible value of publicity the learning annex had advertised his speech heavily and trump thought that helped his brand therefore in his mind he d been paid more than 1 million even though his actual payment was 400 000 do you actually say that when you say you got a million dollars publicly ceresney asked i don t break it down trump said as the deposition went on the lawyers led trump through case after case in which he d overstated his success the lawyer played a clip from larry king s talk show in which king asked trump how many people worked for him twenty two thousand or so trump said are all those people on your payroll ceresney asked him no not directly trump said he said he was counting employees of other companies that acted as suppliers and subcontractors to his businesses another one in o brien s book trump had been quoted saying i had zero borrowings from my father s estate i give you my word under oath mr trump have you ever borrowed money from your father s estate i think a small amount a long time ago trump said i think it was like in the 9million range another one in one of his own books trump had said about one of his golf courses membership costs 300 000 i think it s a bargain under oath in fact your memberships were not selling at 300 000 at that time correct we ve sold many for two hundred thousand trump said then trump pushed it upward we ve sold many for i think two fifty but this was not the place to push it the lawyer had an internal trump document that showed the true figure 200 000 per membership ceresney said correct trump acknowledged right lawyer you didn t correct it when you read the book trump well i did correct it and she didn t correct it but you could have her in as a witness and i m sure we ll bring her in as a witness because what she wrote was i asked her to change it to billions of dollars in debt and she probably forgot lawyer and when you read it you didn t correct it trump i didn t see it lawyer you didn t see it trump i read it very quickly i didn t see it i would have corrected it but i didn t see it in some cases trump acknowledged he was wrong but not that he was at fault instead he sought to turn the blame on others this is somebody that wrote it probably meredith mciver trump said at one point when confronted with another false statement that is a mistake mciver a staff writer with the trump organization blazed into the public eye last month for having inserted plagiarized material taken from michelle obama s 2008 convention speech in the convention speech of trump s wife melania mciver said it had been an innocent mistake but in this deposition more than eight years earlier trump was blaming her for a mistake in one of his own books how to get rich in the 2004 book co written with mciver trump described his massive debt load during a low period in the early 1990s i owed billions upon billions of dollars 9 2billion to be exact the book said as it retold the story of his rise back to success the depth of that financial hole made it seem even more impressive that trump had climbed out again but the figure was wrong his actual debts had been much less i pointed it out to the person who wrote the book trump said meaning mciver right after she wrote the book that s correct trump said then the lawyer showed trump another book he d written with mciver three years later in fact i was 9billion in debt trump read aloud a similar error repeated it was mciver s fault again she probably forgot trump said and when you read it you didn t correct it i didn t see it trump said you didn t see it i read it very quickly trump said about a book he was credited with writing lawyer when you wrote o brien threatened sources by telling them he can quote settle scores with enemies by writing negative articles about them what was the basis for that statement trump just my perception of him i don t know that he indicated anything like that to me but i think he probably did indirectly just my dealing with him in other cases the lawyers prodded trump into admitting that he had made authoritative sounding statements without any proof behind them these statements were another kind of untruth they were not necessarily false they might have been true but trump said them without knowing one way or the other what basis do you have for that statement ceresney asked in one case about an assertion from trump that o brien had been reported to the police for stalking i guess that was probably taken off the internet trump said on to the next one you wrote o brien threatened sources by telling them he can quote settle scores with enemies by writing negative articles about them ceresney asked reading trump s words from a legal complaint what was the basis for that statement just my perception of him trump said i don t know that he indicated anything like that to me but i think he probably did indirectly the most striking example was a question at the very heart of the legal case what was trump s actual net worth trump had told o brien he was worth up to 6billion but the lawyers confronted him with other documents from trump s accountants and from outside banks that seemed to show the real figure was far lower the lawyers asked have you ever not been truthful about your net worth trump s answer here was that the truth about his wealth was in essence up to him to decide my net worth fluctuates and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings even my own feelings trump said but i try the interrogation finally ended after two days trump s attorney made a final demand i want the record to be crystal clear that every single word every question every answer every word is confidential said the attorney mark ressler in 2009 a judge dismissed trump s case against o brien trump appealed but in 2011 that was denied too along the way this once confidential deposition became part of the public record when o brien s attorneys attached it to one of their motions in a brief statement this week trump said he felt the lawsuit was a success despite his loss o brien knows nothing about me trump said his book was a total failure and ultimately i had great success doing what i wanted to do costing this third rate reporter a lot of legal fees o brien now executive editor of bloomberg view said trump got that wrong the publisher and insurance companies covered the cost donald trump lost his lawsuit and unlike him it didn t cost me a penny to litigate it he said rosalind s helderman
