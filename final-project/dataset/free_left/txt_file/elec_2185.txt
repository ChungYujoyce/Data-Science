 morgantown w va shelley brannon 62 can sum up the obama presidency with three words well three words and an exclamation he screwed us said brannon a coal miner from wise county va as he sat outside a rally for the united mine workers of america man he screwed us he shook his head under a camouflage hat that matched his camouflage umwa t shirt and he described his fantasy of dumping nuclear waste in the yards of environmentalists if they think coal s so bad he mulled over the mistake he says the umwa made in 2008 when it endorsed barack obama over hillary rodham clinton then he explained why he would probably be voting for sen bernie sanders i vt in the next democratic primary for one thing he knows what union is and he respects it brannon said that s all we need is respect he s just a likable fellow trustworthy i don t think she has the same respect for the union and she really shot herself in the foot over you know all that secretive stuff west virginia has rejected the obama era democratic party more dramatically than any other state outside the south with appalachian counties that voted for michael dukakis and walter mondale turning blood red over the past eight years but if you think it s in places like this where the insurgent sanders campaign faces its most formidable test here s what he thinks it is also one of his greatest opportunities the vermont socialist believes that white working class voters the sort of people obama once self defeatingly said cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren t like them are just one honest argument away from coming back we have millions of working class people who are voting for republican candidates whose views are diametrically opposite to what voters want sanders said in an interview how many think it s a great idea that we have trade policies that lead to plants in west virginia being shut down how many think there should be massive cuts in pell grants or in social security in my opinion not too many people this state one of the last to vote in the 2016 primary race is supposed to be clinton country seven years ago in the 2008 primary west virginia democrats gave clinton a landslide victory over obama she won 69percent of the white vote and did even better with voters who lacked a college education a democrat who improved a few points on obama s 39 percent of the national white vote in the 2012 general election would stroll into the white house sanders who has won elections only in a white rural state thinks his brand of bold democratic socialism can sell he has never campaigned here yet at friday s rally in morgantown miner after miner said they basically agreed with the former mayor of burlington more than they agreed with clinton several were aware that sanders had walked picket lines something that resonated as they packed a hotel ballroom to demand that washington fully fund umwa pensions when the room quieted a man recited a prayer against greed lord we know that satan has those corporate thieves he said and they re still trying to rob us then a singer songwriter started in it s a long way to wall street from 12th and main and the back roads of my home town there s a new world order and times have changed so they let these deals go down sanders s campaign theory may be that there s a larger electorate hiding in plain sight over the summer as he gained in polls sanders was criticized for bringing seemingly every issue back to the sediment of economics and class black lives matter activist marissa johnson dubbed it class reductionism clinton allies had trouble seeing how his support could grow beyond white liberals sen joe manchin iii d w va who has endorsed clinton said sanders has a weakness in west virginia greater even than the socialist label coal although the economics first focus makes sense manchin said sanders s support for every major obama initiative on the environment makes his candidacy a nonstarter here his environmental stance manchin asked oh my it would be awful but sanders believes that such naysayers are missing the weight of his cardinal argument for greater economic fairness and voters willingness to look past the other issues where they disagree he has won elections in vermont a white rural gun owning state as a socialist the social issue distractions bemoaned by red state democrats have seemed to bounce right off his armor he has taken mixed positions on gun control supporting a ban on assault rifles for instance but opposing the brady bill in the end is the white guy who voted for him in vermont any different than the white guy in west virginia or kentucky or ohio who was told to blame liberals for his problems a key to the southern vote lies centuries ago on another continent what i ve found in vermont and around the country is that we go to people and say look we do have differences sanders said i believe in gay marriage i m not going to change your view if you don t i believe climate change is absolutely real and some of you do not but how many of you think we should give hundreds of billions in tax breaks to the richest 1 percent conservative sen ted cruz r tex has made a similar argument that his party can win with no changes to its message if more evangelical voters are inspired to come out bolstering sanders s case are his strong numbers in independent polls a national quinnipiac survey last month found him polling marginally better against leading republican candidates than clinton did a marquette university poll last week indicated that sanders is running just as strong as clinton in wisconsin home to some of the white voters who have abandoned the democrats in off years something similar may be happening in west virginia in morgantown home to west virginia university a 62 year old activist named andy cockburn went to an early organizing meeting for clinton and found only 10 other people in july more than 100 people packed a bar basement and started organizing for sanders railing against oligarchies and the 1 percent means one thing in new york or san francisco it means more in west virginia where coal magnate don blankenship is standing trial and patriot coal is trying to spend most of a 22 million settlement for miners on its own attorneys on friday night at the democrats jefferson jackson dinner in the state capital charleston bill clinton echoed his wife and condemned patriot but sanders is the candidate with consistency on corporate greed a fact that has helped him slow down some labor endorsements for clinton according to the new york times the international association of fire fighters hit the pause button on its expected endorsement after too many local leaders blanched on saturday sanders lost the endorsement of the national education association but only after a similar protest made clinton work for it the umwa has never endorsed clinton in 2008 it went for the doomed campaign of john edwards switching to obama only after he had basically sewn up the nomination in 2012 it made no endorsement in an avowed protest of the administration s environmental regulations this year the union with 32 354 of its 71 160 members based in west virginia is not yet close to a decision what we re going to do is base our decision on our future here umwa president cecil roberts said in an interview whether we re going to have health care have pensions have jobs for people in appalachia that question could vex sanders just as much as clinton in his energy talking points sanders notes that he introduced the gold standard for climate change legislation with sen barbara boxer to tax carbon and methane emissions a r sum item that would be about as welcome in west virginia as a university of maryland terps jersey asked what he would say to a coal miner who blames environmental protection agency regulations for the loss of his job sanders said he could only be straight with him what we have to say is look through no fault of your own you re working in an industry which is helping to cause climate change and in fact having a negative impact on the country and world sanders said what the government does have is an obligation to say we ll protect you financially as we transition away from fossil fuel we are going to create jobs in your community extended unemployment benefits if you lose your job to a trade deal you get benefits for two years you get job training i would take that same approach to energy jobs that are lost because of the threat of climate change nothing about sanders s pitch is easy but this piece is especially rough state rep mike caputo d a miner and a union member said his brothers need jobs not pity in an interview at the umwa office in fairmont he asked you can train a guy to be a truck driver but what s he going to haul coal miners don t want unemployment they want work still on thursday at his farm in grafton democratic former state legislator mike manypenny was firm that enthusiasm for sanders is big and getting bigger manypenny one of the many casualties of a 2014 republican sweep is running for congress on the theory that the progressive politics he shares with sanders a living wage the return of glass steagall s repealed restrictions on banks are the way to break the conservative grip on voters imaginations the problem last year was that everybody focused on getting the vote out from the historic democratic voters he explained those are the seniors i don t need to tell you that each year you lose a little more of them this is something new barring anything happening in the democratic debate like bernie stumbling badly i don t see anything changing the momentum i think he wins
