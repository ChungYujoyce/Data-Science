sen elizabeth warren d mass came in third in iowa fourth in the new hampshire and nevada contests and fifth in south carolina so why is she still in the race and why does she think she has a plausible path to victory the results tuesday night will tell us a lot if she wins massachusetts worth 114 delegates and picks up a batch of delegates in california where she has been polling ahead of former new york mayor mike bloomberg she will remain a credible candidate her path to the nomination then could take one of two paths the first would necessitate that sen bernie sanders i vt stumble because he has delighted in poking so many democrats in the eye and declined to explain any real world scenario in which his 30 trillion medicare for all scheme could work it is possible that sanders s appeal fades a bad debate performance a series of troubling revelations and or rising concern about refusal to release his health records as he promised following his heart attack five months ago might slow him warren the only woman left in the race and therefore now with the backing of emily s list could surge nevertheless the potential for her to get a majority of delegates or even a plurality is not huge super tuesday live updates the second route is as a compromise candidate in the convention there is a not insignificant chance that not only could no candidate obtain a majority but that the votes will be rather evenly divided between sanders and former vice president joe biden warren might bargain her way onto the ticket as a vp but she could also present herself as the compromise between the far left and the center left if she wants to fight for the nomination as opposed to placating the bernie bros or angling for a cabinet spot she is going to need to draw some sharp contrasts between herself and sanders which is something she has been reluctant to do simply saying i d be a better president no matter how true is not going to do it she does however have several potential lines of attack first sanders s refusal to release his medical records is as disturbing if not more than bloomberg s refusal to waive nondisclosure agreements both go to fitness to serve and to the honesty of the candidates in communicating information to the public warren can put transparency front and center second rather than simply say she would be a better president warren is well situated to make the point that sanders does not get along with others he will win no popularity contests in congress has not developed relationships within the party let alone across the aisle and really has no clue how to govern she on the other hand did set up and staff an agency with more than 1 000 people the consumer financial protection bureau she turned an idea into something concrete sanders is the guy you want to rabble rouse and whip up the crowd but he shows little inclination to reconcile a divided party and to get into the weeds of governance finally warren should say out loud what honest progressives know sanders is too easy to caricature too much of a burden to down ticket democrats and too vulnerable to attacks about past comments and writings in short she has a case to make that sanders s ideas are not disqualifying but his biography demeanor and tone are that s a tough argument to make to an old ally but if she hadn t noticed he sure has no qualms about trying to knock her out of the race by winning her home state politics is not for the timid if warren really wants the nomination she needs to overcome her aversion to hitting sanders if not she might as well go home after tuesday night s votes are counted read more jennifer rubin amy klobuchar is out democrats should thank her jennifer rubin bloomberg is the second former new york mayor to bank on a silly strategy paul waldman elizabeth warren just tore apart a billionaire why not trump read post op eds by warren explore recent columns from post opinion writers see the post s view from a recent editorial bernie sanders s and elizabeth warren s health care plans sound too good to be true they are get more information on warren s candidacy and policy positions what will happen in the primaries play the post opinions simulator to build your own possible outcomes how are warren and other candidates faring in the post pundit 2020 power ranking here s the latest installment want more on the 2020 elections see all of the post s coverage receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
