president says white house is finalizing plan to end the rampant abuse of asylum system jamiles lartey now and erin durkin earlier thu 1 nov 2018 23 27gmt first published on thu 1 nov 2018 13 11gmt 11 26pm gmt 23 26 in case it wasn t clear at the start of the day it was clear by the end republicans are going all in on stoking fear about migrants at the eve of the 2018 midterm election they day began with much of the political world still clamoring over a xenophobic and factually inaccurate ad targeting migrants tweeted by donald trump yesterday and compared by many to the racist willie horton ad of a generation ago a number of republicans and democrats denounced the ad but its basic theme that migrants represent a pressing violent threat to the safety and security of the country continued trump announced plans for a sweeping reform to the us asylum process to be made by executive order sometime next week which is election week trump this is a perilous situation and it threatens to become even more hazardous as our economy gets better and better we have the hottest economy in the world and the jobs and unemployment you look at any numbers right now we have more people working than at any time in the history of our country and people want to come in and in some cases they want to take advantage of that and that s okay and we want them to come in but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally large organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border some people call it an invasion it s like an invasion and they violently overrun the mexican border these are tough people in many cases lots of young men strong men and a lot of men maybe we don t want in our country meanwhile a group of a dozen republican congressmen are asking the department of justice to look at at actors who might be behind the invasion trump continues his busy rally schedule tonight in missouri where he ll stump for republican josh

small issue mike pence is attacking hollywood liberals like oprah and will ferrell for coming into georgia in 2016 more major motion pictures were filmed in georgia than in california liberals from the entertainment industry are actually an important part of georgia s economic boom https t co kz07hbusie indeed the largest film studio outside of hollywood resides squarely in the peach state 10 29pm gmt 22 29 twelve republican congressman have signed on to a letter asking the department of justice to investigate the migrant caravan and the actors responsible for this invasion parroting trump s hyperbolic language signers include representatives paul gosar jeff duncan louie gohmert and steve king the letter urges the doj to investigate the circumstances surrounding the most recent mass migration effort and potential laws that may have been broken by american entities for years our immigration laws have been exploited said congressman gosar right now thousands of central american migrants are traveling thousands of miles to reach our border the level of organization logistics and coordination being depicted in reports of the most recent caravan raises serious concerns i urge the department of justice to investigate the matter to determine the actors responsible for this invasion 9 59pm gmt 21 59 omar jadwat director of the aclu s immigrants rights project had this to say about trump s remarks today president trump did not announce an immigration policy this afternoon but repeatedly lied about the asylum system his family separation policy and his largely unfunded wall if he plans at some point to prohibit people from applying for asylum between the ports of entry that plan is illegal what is clear from the timing and vague nature of today s remarks is that he is simply trying to inflame his base in the final run up to the midterms 9 55pm gmt 21 55 trump discussed the possibility of both holding migrants in tent cities and of them being directly deported after capture it is unclear in his administration s forthcoming policy which action would apply to which individuals but the direct deportation of asylum seekers would run afoul of international treaties prohibit the united states from returning an asylum seeker to a country where they have a credible fear of being persecuted tortured or killed trump big change as of a couple of days ago we are going to no longer release we are going to catch but we are not going to release they the migrants are going to stay with us until the hearing takes place we are not releasing into the community those people they know who they are and we know a lot of where they are and who they are and those people will be deported directly deported 9 41pm gmt 21 41 trump didn t offer many statistics today in his case for overhauling the asylum process at the southern border mostly just vague language about security and violent tough people one of the statistics he did offer that only 3 of asylum seekers return to court for their trial is patently false justice department data suggests that in fact 60 to 75 of non detained migrants have attended their immigration court proceedings for the specific group of migrants trump was addressing asylum seekers data suggests the return rate is even higher note these data from a department of homeland security office of inspector general report on a program for asylum seekers that trump has since ended according to ice overall program compliance for all five regions is an average of 99 percent for ice check ins and appointments as well as 100 percent attendance at court hearings the report said since the inception of fcmp 23 out of 954 participants 2 percent were reported as absconders updated at 10 16pm gmt 9 26pm gmt 21 26 trump spent much of his remarks discussing the need to detain and hold migrants and touting his decision to sent military personnel to the border but the two are actually quite separate as the military has said that soldiers cannot and would not be used to detain people trump has a clear desire to make it seem as if the military will be the front line guns ready caravan defenders the military says the troops are apparently being deployed to do backup support work for the border patrol can t even detain anyone https t co vxwjjrnbeu trump s description of total agreement on how to define the migrant caravan is also obviously false trump this is an invasion and nobody is questioning that lots of people are questioning that 9 12pm gmt 21 12 donald trump has finished speaking at the white house and unsurprisingly theres a lot to unpack from a fact checking standpoint about his remarks fact checking contextualizing this one speech would probably take a small book trump started with comments that were mostly prepared but in answering questions delivered more of a trademark trump extemporaneous performance after suggesting that his administration would end catch and release trump insisted that the us would instead hold migrants and specifically asylum seekers in new yet to be built tent cities where parents and children would be housed together trump of course was politically hammered over his administration s now abandoned policy of child separations he used the question period to make some familiar and false claims about the policy being a holdover form the obama administration which he softened trump lies that he did the exact same thing as obama with separating children no but nobody complained about obama doing it no people complained about what obama did do but people are going crazy when it s him trump is adding to his lying about child separation saying he was actually gentler than obama all i did was take the same law and then i softened the law he had a much harsher policy wasn t the same then backed down reluctantly after an outcry 8 49pm gmt 20 49 trump says migrants are throwing rocks viciously at the military and that he wants the military to treat anyone doing that as if they are armed with a deadly weapon when they throw rocks consider it a rifle trump said updated at 10 19pm gmt
