a guide to making sense of a problem that is now too big for any one person to fully comprehend ed yong and ross andersen will discuss the challenges of reporting on covid 19 live at 2 p m et thursday may 7 register for the big story eventcast here on march 27 as the u s topped 100 000 confirmed cases of covid 19 donald trump stood at the lectern of the white house press briefing room and was asked what he d say about the pandemic to a child amid a meandering answer trump remarked you can call it a germ you can call it a flu you can call it a virus you know you can call it many different names i m not sure anybody even knows what it is to hear more feature stories get the audm iphone app that was neither the most consequential statement from the white house nor the most egregious but it was perhaps the most ironic in a pandemic characterized by extreme uncertainty one of the few things experts know for sure is the identity of the pathogen responsible a virus called sars cov 2 that is closely related to the original sars virus both are members of the coronavirus family which is entirely distinct from the family that includes influenza viruses scientists know the shape of proteins on the new coronavirus s surface down to the position of individual atoms give me two hours and i can do a dramatic reading of its entire genome but much else about the pandemic is still maddeningly unclear why do some people get really sick but others do not are the models too optimistic or too pessimistic exactly how transmissible and deadly is the virus how many people have actually been infected how long must social restrictions go on for why are so many questions still unanswered the confusion partly arises from the pandemic s scale and pace worldwide at least 3 1 million people have been infected in less than four months economies have nose dived societies have paused in most people s living memory no crisis has caused so much upheaval so broadly and so quickly we ve never faced a pandemic like this before so we don t know what is likely to happen or what would have happened says zo mclaren a health policy professor at the university of maryland at baltimore county that makes it even more difficult in terms of the uncertainty but beyond its vast scope and sui generis nature there are other reasons the pandemic continues to be so befuddling a slew of forces scientific and societal epidemiological and epistemological what follows is an analysis of those forces and a guide to making sense of a problem that is now too big for any one person to fully comprehend because coronavirus wasn t part of the popular lexicon until sars cov 2 ran amok this year earlier instances of the term are readily misconstrued when people learned about a meeting in which global leaders role played through a fictional coronavirus pandemic some wrongly argued that the actual pandemic had been planned when people noticed mentions of human coronavirus on old cleaning products some wrongly assumed that manufacturers had somehow received advance warning read why the coronavirus has been so successful there isn t just one coronavirus besides sars cov 2 six others are known to infect humans four are mild and common causing a third of colds while two are rare but severe causing mers and the original sars but scientists have also identified about 500 other coronaviruses among china s many bat species there will be many more i think it s safe to say tens of thousands says peter daszak of the ecohealth alliance who has led that work laboratory experiments show that some of these new viruses could potentially infect humans sars cov 2 likely came from a bat too it seems unlikely that a random bat virus should somehow jump into a susceptible human but when you consider millions of people in regular contact with millions of bats which carry tens of thousands of new viruses vanishingly improbable events become probable ones in 2015 daszak s team found that 3 percent of people from four chinese villages that are close to bat caves had antibodies that indicated a previous encounter with sars like coronaviruses bats fly out every night over their houses some of them shelter from rain in caves or collect guano for fertilizer daszak says if you extrapolate up to the rural population across the region where the bats that carry these viruses live you re talking 1 million to 7 million people a year exposed most of these infections likely go nowhere it takes just one to trigger an epidemic once that happens uncertainties abound as scientists race to characterize the new pathogen that task is always hard but especially so when the pathogen is a coronavirus they re very hard to work with they don t grow very well in cell cultures and it s been hard to get funding says vineet menachery of the university of texas medical branch he is one of just a few dozen virologists in the world who specialize in coronaviruses which have attracted comparatively little attention compared with more prominent threats like flu the field swelled slightly after the sars epidemic of 2003 but then shrunk as interest and funding dwindled it wasn t til mers came along in 2012 that i even thought i could have an academic career on coronaviruses menachery says the tight group of coronavirologists is now racing to make up for years of absent research a tall order in the middle of a pandemic we re working as hard as possible says lisa gralinski a virologist at the university of north carolina our space is so intermingled that we can t socially distance among ourselves much one small mercy she notes is that sars cov 2 isn t changing dramatically scientists are tracking its evolution in real time and despite some hype about the existence of different strains the virologists i ve spoken with largely feel that the virus is changing at a steady and predictable pace there are no signs of an alarming mutation we need to be worried about gralinski says for now the world is facing just one threat but that threat can manifest in many ways sars cov 2 is the virus covid 19 is the disease that it causes the two aren t the same the disease arises from a combination of the virus and the person it infects and the society that person belongs to some people who become infected never show any symptoms others become so ill that they need ventilators early chinese data suggested that severe and fatal illness occurs mostly in the elderly but in the u s and especially in the south many middle aged adults have been hospitalized perhaps because they are more likely to have other chronic illnesses the virus might vary little around the world but the disease varies a lot read the coronavirus s unique threat to the south this explains why some of the most important stats about the coronavirus have been hard to pin down estimates of its case fatality rate cfr the proportion of diagnosed people who die have ranged from 0 1 to 15 percent it s frustrating to not have a firm number but also unrealistic to expect one folks are talking about cfr as this unchangeable quantity and that is not how it works says maia majumder an epidemiologist at harvard medical school and boston children s hospital the cfr s denominator total cases depends on how thoroughly a country tests its population its numerator total deaths depends on the spread of ages within that population the prevalence of preexisting illnesses how far people live from hospitals and how well staffed or well equipped those hospitals are these factors vary among countries states and cities and the cfr will too majumder and her colleagues are now building tools for predicting regional cfrs so local leaders can determine which regions are most vulnerable the variability of covid 19 is also perplexing doctors the disease seems to wreak havoc not only on lungs and airways but also on hearts blood vessels kidneys guts and nervous systems it s not clear if the virus is directly attacking these organs if the damage stems from a bodywide overreaction of the immune system if other organs are suffering from the side effects of treatments or if they are failing due to prolonged stays on ventilators read why some people get sicker than others past coronavirus epidemics offer limited clues because they were so contained worldwide only 10 600 or so people were ever diagnosed with sars or mers combined which is less than the number of covid 19 cases from staten island for new diseases we don t see 100 to 200 patients a week it usually takes a whole career says megan coffee an infectious disease doctor at nyu langone health and if you see enough cases of other diseases you ll see unusual things during the flu pandemic of 2009 for example doctors also documented heart kidney and neurological problems is covid 19 fundamentally different to other diseases or is it just that you have a lot of cases at once asks vinay prasad a hematologist and an oncologist at oregon health and science university prasad s concern is that covid 19 has developed a clinical mystique a perception that it is so unusual it demands radically new approaches human beings are notorious for our desire to see patterns he says put that in a situation of fear uncertainty and hype and it s not surprising that there s almost a folk medicine emerging already there are intense debates about giving patients blood thinners because so many seem to experience blood clots or whether ventilators might do more harm than good these issues may be important and when facing new diseases doctors must be responsive and creative but they must also be rigorous clinicians are under tremendous stress which affects our ability to process information mclaren says is this actually working or does it seem to be working because i want it to work and i feel powerless consider hydroxychloroquine the antimalarial drug that s been repeatedly touted by the white house and conservative pundits as a covid 19 game changer the french studies that first suggested that the drug could treat covid 19 were severely flawed abandoning standard elements of solid science like randomly assigning patients to receive treatments or placebos or including a control group to confirm if the drug offers benefits above normal medical care the lead scientist behind those studies has railed against the dictatorship of the methodologists as if randomization or controls were inconveniences that one should rebel against rather than the backbone of effective medicine read why does the president keep pushing a malaria drug larger but still preliminary studies from the u s france and china have cast doubt on hydroxychloroquine s effectiveness and because it can cause heart problems the national institutes of health has recommended against using it outside clinical trials those trials will offer clearer answers by the summer and the drug may yet prove beneficial for now doctors are routinely prescribing it without knowing if it works or crucially if it does more harm than good meanwhile people with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis who actually need hydroxychloroquine can t get it it is not the case that every new study contributes to our understanding of covid 19 sloppy ones are a net negative adding to the already considerable uncertainty by offering the illusion of confidence where none exists since the pandemic began scientists have published more than 7 500 papers on covid 19 but despite this deluge we haven t seen a lot of huge plot twists says carl bergstrom an epidemiologist and a sociologist of science at the university of washington the most important he says was the realization that people can spread the virus before showing symptoms but even that insight was slow to dawn a flawed german study hinted at it in early february but scientific opinion shifted only after many lines of evidence emerged including case reports models showing that most infections are undocumented and studies indicating that viral levels peak as symptoms appear this is how science actually works it s less the parade of decisive blockbuster discoveries that the press often portrays and more a slow erratic stumble toward ever less uncertainty our understanding oscillates at first but converges on an answer says natalie dean a statistician at the university of florida that s the normal scientific process but it looks jarring to people who aren t used to it for example stanford university researchers recently made headlines after testing 3 330 volunteers from santa clara county for antibodies against the new coronavirus the team concluded that 2 5 to 4 2 percent of people have already been infected a proportion much higher than the official count suggests this the authors claimed means that the virus is less deadly than suspected and that severe lockdowns may be overreactions views they had previously espoused in opinion pieces but other scientists including statisticians virologists and disease ecologists have criticized the study s methods and the team s conclusions one could write a long article assessing the santa clara study alone but that would defeat the point that individual pieces of research are extremely unlikely to single handedly upend what we know about covid 19 about 30 similar serosurveys have now been released these and others to come could collectively reveal how many americans have been infected even then they would have to be weighed against other evidence including accounts from doctors and nurses in new york or lombardy italy which clearly show that sars cov 2 can crush health care systems the precise magnitude of the virus s fatality rate is a matter of academic debate the reality of what it can do to hospitals is not the scientific discussion of the santa clara study might seem ferocious to an outsider but it is fairly typical for academia yet such debates might once have played out over months now they are occurring over days and in full public view epidemiologists who are used to interacting with only their peers are racking up followers on twitter they have suddenly been thrust into political disputes people from partisan media outlets find this stuff and use a single study as a cudgel to beat the other side bergstrom says the climate change people are used to it but we epidemiologists are not in an earlier era issues with the santa clara study would have been addressed during peer review the process in which scientific work is assessed by other researchers before being published in a journal but like many covid 19 studies this one was uploaded as a preprint a paper that hasn t yet run the peer review gauntlet preprints allow scientists to share data quickly and speed is vital in a pandemic several important studies were uploaded and discussed a full month before being published preprints also allow questionable work to directly enter public discourse but that problem is not unique to them the first flawed paper on hydroxychloroquine and covid 19 was published in a peer reviewed journal whose editor in chief is one of the study s co authors another journal published a paper claiming that the new coronavirus probably originated in pangolins after most virologists had considered and dismissed that idea read don t believe the covid 19 models meanwhile scientists are poring over preprints in open online spaces the santa clara study may not have been formally peer reviewed but it has very much been reviewed by peers it is easier than ever for journalists to assess how new research is being received but only some are presenting these debates to their audience others are not some are even reporting on press released research that hasn t been uploaded as a preprint the rules for reporting on preprints shouldn t be any different from reporting on journal articles the journalist ivan oransky told the media watchdog health news review everything needs to be scrutinized beyond belief such scrutiny will become ever more necessary as the pandemic wears on julie pfeiffer of ut southwestern who is an editor at the journal of virology says that she and her colleagues have been flooded with submitted papers most of which are so obviously poor that they haven t even been sent out for review they shouldn t be published anywhere she says and then they end up on a preprint site some come from nonscientists who have cobbled together a poor mathematical model others come from actual virologists who have suddenly pivoted to studying coronaviruses and are submitting work they never normally would in a rush to be first pfeiffer says some people are genuinely trying to help but there s also a huge amount of opportunism last month the legal scholar richard epstein claimed that the current organized panic in the united states does not seem justified and that as the pandemic continued good news is more likely than bad his piece was widely circulated in conservative circles and the trump administration when asked about his lack of epidemiological training in an interview with the new yorker s isaac chotiner epstein responded one of the things you get as a lawyer is a skill of cross examination i spent an enormous amount of time over my career teaching medical people about some of this stuff his essay initially speculated that 500 americans would die from covid 19 he later updated that estimate to 5 000 so far the death toll stands at 58 000 and is still rising many other non epidemiologists seem to have similarly accrued expertise in the field the military historian victor davis hanson proffered the widely shared idea that the coronavirus has been spreading in california since last fall a claim disproved by genetic studies showing that the earliest u s case likely arrived in january during a white house meeting the economist peter navarro reportedly pointed to a pile of hydroxychloroquine studies and said that s science not anecdote to anthony fauci who has worked in public health for five decades and directs the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases the silicon valley technologist aaron ginn self published an article on medium called evidence over hysteria covid 19 that was viewed millions of times before being debunked by bergstrom and taken down read we are living in a failed state expertise is not just about knowledge but also about the capacity to spot errors ginn couldn t see them in his own work bergstrom could the rest of us are more likely to fall in the former group than the latter we hunger for information but lack the know how to evaluate it or the sources that provide it this is the epistemological crisis of the moment there s a lot of expertise around but fewer tools than ever to distinguish it from everything else says zeynep tufekci a sociologist at the university of north carolina and an atlantic contributing writer pure credentialism doesn t always work people have self published a lot of terrible pieces on medium but some of the best early ones that explained stuff to laypeople were from tech guys bergstrom agrees that experts shouldn t be dismissive gatekeepers there s a lot of talent out there and we need all hands on deck he says for example david yu a hockey analyst created a tool that shows how predictions from the most influential covid 19 model in the u s have changed over time looking at that thing for like an hour helped me see things i hadn t seen for three weeks bergstrom says a lack of expertise becomes problematic when it s combined with extreme overconfidence and with society s tendency to reward projected confidence over humility when scientists offer caveats instead of absolutes gralinski says that uncertainty we re trained to acknowledge makes it sound like no one knows what s going on and creates opportunities for people who present as skeptics science itself isn t free from that dynamic either through flawed mechanisms like the nobel prize the scientific world elevates individuals for work that is usually done by teams and perpetuates the myth of the lone genius through attention the media reward voices that are outspoken but not necessarily correct those voices are disproportionately male the idea that there are no experts is overly glib the issue is that modern expertise tends to be deep but narrow even within epidemiology someone who studies infectious diseases knows more about epidemics than say someone who studies nutrition but pandemics demand both depth and breadth of expertise to work out if widespread testing is crucial for controlling the pandemic listen to public health experts to work out if widespread testing is possible listen to supply chain experts to determine if antibody tests can tell people if they re immune to the coronavirus listen to immunologists to determine if such testing is actually a good idea listen to ethicists anthropologists and historians of science no one knows it all and those who claim to should not be trusted in a pandemic the strongest attractor of trust shouldn t be confidence but the recognition of one s limits the tendency to point at expertise beyond one s own and the willingness to work as part of a whole one signature a lot of these armchair epidemiologists have is a grand solution to everything bergstrom says usually we only see that coming from enormous research teams from the best schools or someone s basement in the early months of the pandemic while the coronavirus blazed through china even veteran disease experts seemed to misjudge the odds that the epidemic would become a full blown pandemic on january 26 fauci himself said the virus posed a very very low risk to the united states and was a concern for public health officials but not the public many journalists offered similar reassurances and frequently compared the coronavirus threat with the allegedly greater danger of flu some officials may have been motivated to avoid disproportionate panic of the kind that gripped the u s during the ebola outbreak of 2014 the instinct to be calm and measured is laudable until it isn t alarmism is equated with misinformation and a lot of it is misinformation but when you do have something coming no one feels empowered to say this one isn t alarmism tufekci the sociologist says there s a cultural script that we play and when the script changes it takes time to shift to a new one the narrative that experts underplayed the risks isn t fully correct though on january 26 thomas inglesby of johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health tweeted we should be planning for the possibility that the coronavirus cannot be contained he followed with a list of recommendations several of which more diagnostics more protective equipment transparent communication the u s is still struggling to meet four days later scott gottlieb the former fda commissioner and luciana borio who was part of the national security council s now dissolved pandemic preparedness office similarly urged the government to act now to prevent an american epidemic i hope the lesson people take from this is not experts were wrong tufekci says if you followed the right people they were overwhelmingly right we just didn t put them in the right place so we could hear them the world health organization has also come under fire for hewing too closely to china s position in january and being too slow to confirm that the coronavirus was spreading among people or to finally describe the situation as a pandemic these issues should not detract from all that the who has done to contain the crisis nor should they provide cover for leaders who still failed to prepare their countries after the risks became clearer and after being exhorted to act aggressively and swiftly by well the who but the agency s missteps do offer lessons for communicating in an emergency in mid january it sent a now infamous tweet describing no clear evidence of human to human transmission of the novel coronavirus without clearly discussing other important details such as a new case in thailand and warnings from taiwan and hong kong they didn t give the world the tells tufekci says read the who shouldn t be a plaything for great powers the same could be said of the white house and other u s officials who repeatedly assured americans in january february and even march that their risk was low that might have initially been true inglesby says but officials should have noted that the true extent of the disease was unknown that there wasn t a way of measuring it because tests weren t in place that the virus had already spread globally and that control measures such as airport screening and travel bans have historically been unsuccessful the fuller statements take longer to explain but that s how it is in outbreaks inglesby says there s a lot of uncertainty and we shouldn t try to tidy it up in late february nancy messonnier the respiratory disease chief of the centers for disease control and prevention broke ranks and told americans that community spread of the virus within the u s was a question of when not if messonnier urged the nation to prepare for possible school closures loss of work disruption to everyday life that may be severe and the expectation that this could be bad the next day trump asserted that cases were going to be down to close to zero the day after cdc director robert redfield reiterated that the risk is low and said that messonnier could have been more articulate shortly after redfield said the american public needs to go on with their normal lives of late cdc officials who were constant authoritative voices during past epidemics have been mostly silent the impulse to be reassuring is understandable but the most important thing is to be as accurate as possible inglesby says we should give people information so they can do what they think is right we should tell people what we don t know and when we ll know more the who is learning on april 25 after wrongly tweeting that there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from covid 19 and have antibodies are protected from infection they offered a longer and more accurate explanation if officials and journalists are clear about uncertainties from the start the public can better hang new information onto an existing framework and understand when shifting evidence leads to new policy otherwise updates feel confusing when the cdc suddenly reverses its position on wearing masks without having previously clarified why the issue was so divisive it seems like an arbitrary flip flop that s a dangerous way to communicate says kate starbird at the university of washington who studies how information flows during a crisis it contributes to diminishing trust in organizations and when people don t have a place they can go for trusted information it makes them vulnerable to disinformation during news events like trump s impeachment trial people mostly share information to signal their beliefs says ren e diresta of stanford who studies how narratives spread online but in a disaster people tend to share information to be useful to their community she says sharing offers agency it allows people to collectively make sense of a situation riddled by anxiety and uncertainty but when an earthquake happens you talk to your neighbors and in a few days you ve figured out what s going on starbird says for covid 19 the uncertainty is persistent the pandemic s length traps people in a liminal space to clarify their uprooted life and indefinite future they try to gather as much information as possible and cannot stop we go seeking fresher and fresher information and end up consuming unvetted misinformation that s spreading rapidly bergstrom says pandemics actually unfold in slow motion he says and there s no event that changes the whole landscape on a dime but it feels that way because of how relentlessly we quest for updates historically people would have struggled to find enough information now people struggle because they re finding too much read trump s dangerously effective coronavirus propaganda it does not help that online information channels are heavily personalized and politicized governed by algorithms that reward certain and extreme claims over correct but nuanced ones on twitter false information spreads further than true information and at six times the speed but this is not just a problem of the internet diresta says for a lot of people what is true is what the people i ve chosen to trust in my community say is true those dynamics meant that at least initially liberal and conservative americans had very different understandings of the pandemic as the reality of the pandemic becomes clearer the partisan gap is rapidly closing but as time passes misinformation which refers to misleading stories that are circulated in good faith will give way to disinformation falsehoods deliberately seeded to leverage the disaster for political power starbird says amid the psychological loam of fear and uncertainty conspiracy theories are germinating like weeds the daily briefings from the white house have only exacerbated the confusion trump has repeatedly tried to downplay the pandemic and rewrite his role in mishandling it his playbook is his usual one deny responsibility find a scapegoat incite a culture war and bend reality to his will by baldly stating his version of it even when that version contradicts itself the list of trump s lies about the coronavirus is long and growing as are their consequences his promotion of hydroxychloroquine led to shortages of the drug his false claim that anyone who wants a test can get one sent droves of worried well to already stretched hospitals read the trump presidency is over several journalists and media critics have urged news networks to stop airing the white house briefings live that seems extreme but it s an extreme time when a presidential briefing forces doctors to clarify that people should not consume bleach no matter how many tough questions you ask it really is not possible to prevent him from spreading bad info that could have very serious health effects says jay rosen a journalism professor at nyu people think that more determined journalists can solve the problem and they can t rosen also argues that the media s default rhythm of constant piecemeal updates is ill suited to covering an event as large as the pandemic journalists still think of their job as producing new content but if your goal is public understanding of covid 19 one piece of new content after another doesn t get you there he says it requires a lot of background knowledge to understand the updates and the news system is terrible at providing that knowledge instead the staccato pulse of reports merely amplifies the wobbliness of the scientific process turns incremental bits of evidence into game changers and intensifies the already palpable sense of uncertainty that drives people toward misinformation if the media won t change its consumers might have to starbird recommends slowing down and taking a moment to vet new information before sharing it she herself is spending less time devouring every scrap of pandemic news and more time with local sources it s the equivalent she says of hand washing for the infodemic and it might dispel the illusion that the pandemic can be tracked in real time the rapid pace of new information creates the sense that we can accurately monitor the pandemic as it happens but daily numbers tell a distorted story as april wears on case counts suggest that the pandemic is plateauing in parts of the u s but it s hard to know for sure as my colleagues robinson meyer and alexis madrigal have reported 20 percent of americans who are tested for the coronavirus are still getting positive results this figure is higher than almost every other developed country and has held steady over time it suggests that the u s is still mostly testing people who are very likely to be infected and is still missing the majority of cases if so cases could have leveled off because the u s has maxed out its ability to find infected people this concern complicates the government s plan to start reopening the country after a downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14 day period if the case number is illusory this criterion is meaningless i d want to know that we re doing enough testing to be confident that those numbers really are stabilizing says dean the university of florida statistician i m still not convinced we re in a good place when looking at case counts remember this those numbers do not show how many people have been infected on any given day they reflect the number of tests that were done which is still insufficient the lag in reporting results from those tests which can be long and the proportion of tests that are incorrectly negative which seems high likewise daily death counts do not offer a real time glimpse at the virus s toll because of delays in reporting they tend to be lower on weekends deaths are hard to tally in general and the process differs among diseases the cdc estimates that flu kills 24 000 to 62 000 americans every year a number that seems superficially similar to the 58 000 covid 19 deaths thus far that comparison is misleading covid 19 deaths are counted based either on a positive diagnostic test for the coronavirus or on clinical judgment flu deaths are estimated through a model that looks at hospitalizations and death certificates and accounts for the possibility that many deaths are due to flu but aren t coded as such if flu deaths were counted like covid 19 deaths the number would be substantially lower this doesn t mean we re overestimating the flu it does mean we are probably underestimating covid 19 the means of gathering data always complicate the interpretation of those data consider the reports that the coronavirus can reactivate in recovered patients or that people can become reinfected this really means that patients are testing positive for the virus after having tested negative but that might have nothing to do with the virus and everything to do with the test diagnostic tests for covid 19 produce a lot of false negatives incorrectly telling 15 to 30 percent of infected people that they re in the clear and even if these tests were better the viral levels of a recovering patient would eventually fall below their threshold of accuracy when such patients are sequentially tested some will toggle between negative and positive results creating the appearance of reinfection false positives are a problem too many companies and countries have pinned their hopes on antibody tests which purportedly show whether someone has been infected by the coronavirus one such test claims to correctly identify people with those antibodies 93 8 percent of the time by contrast it identifies phantom antibodies in 4 4 percent of people who don t have them that false positive rate sounds acceptably low it s not let s assume 5 percent of the u s has been infected so far among 1 000 people the test would correctly identify antibodies in 47 of the 50 people who had them but it would also wrongly spot antibodies in 42 of the 950 people without them the number of true positives and false positives would be almost equal in this scenario if you were told you had coronavirus antibodies your odds of actually having them would be little better than a coin toss read no testing no treatment no herd immunity no easy way out none of this means that all bets are off and the pandemic is unquantifiable the case count might be wrong but it s almost certainly too low rather than too high and it s more likely off by a factor of 10 than 100 the numbers still matter they re just messy and hard to interpret especially in the moment on my phone i can see weather patterns the position of every plane in the sky and the number of people currently reading this article all in real time but i cannot get the same immediate information about the pandemic the numbers i see say as much about the tools researchers are using as the quantities they are measuring i think people underestimate how difficult it is to measure things dean says for us who work in public health measuring things is like 80 percent of the problem if measuring the present is hard predicting the future is even harder the mathematical models that have guided the world s pandemic responses have been often portrayed as crystal balls that is not their purpose they instead describe a range of possibilities and help scientists and policy makers to simulate what might happen pending different courses of action models reveal many possible fates and allow us to choose one and while distant projections are necessarily blurry the path ahead is not unknowable the long term is like modeling the trajectory of a falling leaf but the short term is like modeling a falling bowling ball says dylan morris an infectious disease modeler at princeton uncertainties about the year ahead shouldn t cloud how devastatingly and terrifyingly certain we can be about the immediate consequences if the pandemic isn t controlled he adds in the final second of december 31 1999 clocks ticked into a new millennium and not much happened the infamous y2k bug a quirk of computer code that was predicted to cause global chaos did very little twenty years later y2k is almost synonymous with overreaction a funny moment when humanity freaked out over nothing but it wasn t nothing it actually was a serious problem which never fully materialized because a lot of people worked very hard to prevent it there are two lessons one can learn from an averted disaster tufekci says one is that was exaggerated the other is that was close last month a team at imperial college london released a model that said the coronavirus pandemic could kill 2 2 million americans if left unchecked so it was checked governors and mayors closed businesses and schools banned large gatherings and issued stay at home orders these social distancing measures were rolled out erratically and unevenly but they seem to be working the death toll is still climbing but seems unlikely to hit the worst case 2 2 million ceiling that was close or as some pundits are already claiming that was exaggerated the coronavirus is not unlike the y2k bug a real but invisible risk when a hurricane or an earthquake hits the danger is evident the risk self explanatory and the aftermath visible it is obvious when to take shelter and when it s safe to come out but viruses lie below the threshold of the senses neither peril nor safety is clear whenever i go outside for a brief masked walk i reel from cognitive dissonance as i wander a world that has been irrevocably altered but that looks much the same i can still read accounts of people less lucky those who have lost and those who have been lost but i cannot read about the losses that never occurred because they were averted prevention may be better than cure but it is also less visceral the coronavirus not only co opts our cells but exploits our cognitive biases humans construct stories to wrangle meaning from uncertainty and purpose from chaos we crave simple narratives but the pandemic offers none the facile dichotomy between saving either lives or the economy belies the broad agreement between epidemiologists and economists that the u s shouldn t reopen prematurely the lionization of health care workers and grocery store employees ignores the risks they are being asked to shoulder and the protective equipment they aren t being given the rise of small anti lockdown protests overlooks the fact that most republicans and democrats agree that social distancing should continue for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus read how the pandemic will end and the desire to name an antagonist be it the chinese communist party or donald trump disregards the many aspects of 21st century life that made the pandemic possible humanity s relentless expansion into wild spaces soaring levels of air travel chronic underfunding of public health a just in time economy that runs on fragile supply chains health care systems that yoke medical care to employment social networks that rapidly spread misinformation the devaluation of expertise the marginalization of the elderly and centuries of structural racism that impoverished the health of minorities and indigenous groups it may be easier to believe that the coronavirus was deliberately unleashed than to accept the harsher truth that we built a world that was prone to it but not ready for it in the classic hero s journey the archetypal plot structure of myths and movies the protagonist reluctantly departs from normal life enters the unknown endures successive trials and eventually returns home having been transformed if such a character exists in the coronavirus story it is not an individual but the entire modern world the end of its journey and the nature of its final transformation will arise from our collective imagination and action and they like so much else about this moment are still uncertain theatlantic com copyright c 2020 by the
