by william saletan president donald trump says it s unfair to criticize his response to the coronavirus pandemic no one could have seen this crisis coming he argues and no president could have acted more quickly but that s not how trump talks about other leaders he condemns governors mayors and previous presidents for failing in his view to prepare for the disaster or respond adequately to it everything i took over was a mess he fumed at a press conference on friday it was a broken country in so many ways in particular trump says gov andrew cuomo should have anticipated that new york state would need thousands of extra ventilators and he accuses former president barack obama of moving too slowly against swine flu in 2009 both complaints are hypocritical trump had far clearer warnings than cuomo did and he has moved far more slowly than obama did by the standards trump applies to others his coronavirus response is a failure on tuesday in a fox news interview trump excoriated cuomo new york gov cuomo rejected buying a recommended 16 000 ventilators in 2015 for the pandemic said the president reading from a right wing blog post trump embellished the story claiming that cuomo had a chance to buy the ventilators at a very low price and he turned it down he should have ordered the ventilators said the president trump had the story wrong in november 2015 a new york state task force reported that although the state had enough ventilators to manage a moderate flu outbreak they wouldn t be sufficient in the event of a severe public health emergency on the scale of the 1918 influenza pandemic the report calculated that in a severe influenza pandemic there is likely to be a projected shortfall of ventilators 15 783 during peak week demand the report addressed a scenario that hadn t been seen in nearly a century it didn t envision the present crisis and its projection of the ventilator shortage was well below estimates issued by new york this week nor did the report recommend buying more ventilators on the contrary it concluded that if the state were hit by a severe pandemic purchasing additional ventilators beyond a threshold will not save additional lives because there will not be a sufficient number of trained staff to operate them the report added that buying so many ventilators in preparation for a hypothetical catastrophe would squeeze funding for current and ongoing health care expenses trump has also lied about obama on march 4 he claimed that obama s administration didn t do anything about the 2009 swine flu outbreak on march 12 trump said nothing was done for such a long period of time as people were dying all over the place on march 13 trump said obama s team started thinking about testing when it was far too late and on thursday trump told sean hannity they acted very very late they were incredibly late none of that is true the 2009 outbreak started in mexico the mexican government reported it to the pan american health organizationon april 12 of that year two days later the u s centers for disease control and prevention examined a specimen in the united states and by april 15 the cdc had determined it was swine flu on april 22 the cdc activated its emergency operations center on april 26 the department of health and human services declared a public health emergency and began to send antiviral drugs and personal protective equipment to affected states on april 30 the obama administration asked congress for 1 5 billion to fight the virus by april 28 the cdc had developed a test to detect the virus and on may 1 the test kits were shipped out if obama deserves criticism for taking 19 days to ship out tests and if cuomo is at fault for not buying extra ventilators four years ago then trump s negligence in preparing for and responding to this crisis deserves far more condemnation in the past three years the president has ignored multiple direct warnings briefings reports simulations intelligence assessments that a pandemic was likely and that the government didn t have enough masks ventilators or antiviral drugs to deal with it his administration was told exactly what to do second guess case detection rates prepare rapid production of tests and line up extra funding and personal protective equipment he did none of it he stiffed a budget request for preparedness funds and he disbanded the national security council unit in charge of pandemics once the pandemic arrived trump responded far more slowly than obama did trump s administration learned of the outbreak in china around new year s day but he brushed off briefings about it figuring it hadn t spread in the united states the cdc offered to send its own experts to china but china refused and trump overriding advice and u s intelligence backed off on jan 21 the cdc reported the first known american infection but in an interview on cnbc trump scoffed it s one person coming in from china we have it under control it s going to be just fine data released by the world health organization showed the coronavirus was killing victims at a far higher rate than swine flu did that remains true even though calculated mortality rates from the coronavirus have declined but the trump administration didn t declare a public health emergency until jan 31 the president had to be pushed to ban travelers from china and he did nothing domestically in late january the administration rebuffed an hhs request for money to buy masks and other emergency supplies throughout february as u s intelligence agencies monitored the spread of the virus in europe and asia trump insisted the united states was safe when a cdc official raised concerns in public trump rebuked her for scaring the stock market the cdc didn t begin shipping out test kits to detect the coronavirus until feb 5 more than a month after learning of the outbreak the tests didn t work properly so the cdc had to make new ones not until feb 28 did the cdc announce that states could now start testing trump didn t request funds to deal with the virus until feb 24 and he asked for only a quarter of the money hhs said it needed the administration didn t begin sending personal protective equipment to states until the end of february and it dragged its feet on providing ventilators until the end of march by every measure preparation organization funding testing ventilators masks public communication trump s performance has been abysmal he s weeks and weeks behind obama and his disregard for multiple direct warnings about a pandemic is by the standard of foresight he applies to cuomo inexcusable so when trump claims that nobody could have ever seen something like this coming and that no previous administration could have delivered supplies as quickly as he has he s lying judge him as he has judged others readers like you make our work possible help us continue to provide the reporting commentary and criticism you won t find anywhere
