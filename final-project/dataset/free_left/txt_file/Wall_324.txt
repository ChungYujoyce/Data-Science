advertisement supported by the manhattan church the largest gothic cathedral in the world will be able to care for at least 200 patients during the coronavirus outbreak by liam stack the vast interior of the cathedral church of st john the divine in manhattan stood empty on monday the thousands of chairs that normally sit beneath its soaring ceiling and stained glass windows removed to make room for a more grim sight a coronavirus field hospital the cathedral which describes itself as the largest gothic cathedral in the world said on monday that its 600 foot long nave and equally large subterranean crypt would be turned into an emergency hospital as part of the fight against the pandemic nine climate controlled medical tents capable of holding a total of at least 200 patients will be erected inside the cathedral by the end of the week said the rt rev clifton daniel iii the dean of the cathedral the crypt which is primarily accessible via a series of winding staircases will be used as a staging area for medical personnel he said it is the first time the cathedral which is the seat of the episcopal diocese of new york will have been used for such a task he said the last thing like this was the flu pandemic in 1918 but the world was different then and i don t think they used the cathedral in this way dean daniel said in an interview inside the empty church but traditionally in earlier centuries cathedrals were always used this way like during the plague so this is not outside the experience of being a cathedral it is just new to us patients are expected to arrive at the cathedral field hospital by the end of this week or early next week said james patterson its director of facilities and capital projects he said roughly 400 beds were delivered to the cathedral last week and three tents sat in crates on a loading dock on monday church officials said that it was not clear if patients with covid 19 the disease caused by the coronavirus would be sent to the cathedral but that it seemed likely given the scale of the outbreak we are assuming that there will be mr patterson said that s the way people were talking today the field hospital will be staffed with personnel from mount sinai morningside hospital which sits next door to the cathedral complex a manicured 11 acre oasis in morningside heights that houses several stone buildings and three peacocks dean daniel said he offered the use of the cathedral to the hospital last month once the field hospital is up and running mr patterson said the cathedral s primary job will be prosaic but essential things like providing heat and keeping the lights on he said that organizing the field hospital had been a logistical challenge and that it remained unclear how the hospital would perform some tasks in particular when it comes to questions of feeding and bathing patients updated may 12 2020 there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others this is a difficult question because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained a better question might be how will we know when to reopen the country in an american enterprise institute report scott gottlieb caitlin rivers mark b mcclellan lauren silvis and crystal watson staked out four goal posts for recovery hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested it seems to spread very easily from person to person especially in homes hospitals and other confined spaces the pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out it may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face no clinical trials are underway in the united states china and europe but american officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away unlike the flu there is no known treatment or vaccine and little is known about this particular virus so far it seems to be more lethal than the flu but the numbers are still uncertain and it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions not just those with respiratory diseases particularly hard if the family member doesn t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms while also keeping as much distance as possible according to guidelines issued by the c d c if there s space the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if masks are available both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters doorknobs toilets and tables don t forget to wash your hands frequently plan two weeks of meals if possible but people should not hoard food or supplies despite the empty shelves the supply chain remains strong and remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea that s not a good idea even if you re retired having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation or even grows makes sense but retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years watching your balance go up and down can be scary you may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions don t if your employer matches any part of your contributions make sure you re at least saving as much as you can to get that free money there is still a lot of engineering involved with things like showers and things like that that we all take for granted mr patterson said that is something they need to figure out samaritan s purse a nondenominational evangelical christian humanitarian organization that built a field hospital in central park last month has also been involved in the hospital in the cathedral dean daniel said the group is led by the rev franklin graham who has been criticized for anti muslim and anti l g b t q rhetoric that stands in contrast to the more inclusive vision of christianity embraced by the cathedral mayor bill de blasio said at a news conference last week that the city and mount sinai had received assurances from samaritan s purse that it would follow the city s anti discrimination laws in providing treatment dean daniel said the participation of samaritan s purse in the field hospital should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its views i don t agree with their position on muslims and gays and a number of other things but i am willing to work together with them to save lives he said i feel like it is sort of like the steward on the titanic as it is sinking now is not
