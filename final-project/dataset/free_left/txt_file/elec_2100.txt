 she is ready on video but how about real life by roger simon 04 13 2015 05 49 am edt most of us get only one chance to make a first impression but hillary clinton gets as many chances as she wants she has invented herself almost as many times as edison tried to invent the light bulb advertisement this is not necessarily a bad thing america is a land of reinvention our forefathers and foremothers came here to build fresh new lives unfettered by the past so as hillary now officially runs for president again she is allowed to adopt a new persona again now as saturday night live deftly satirized over the weekend she needs to be personal intimate natural and hilarious and hillary as her campaign refers to her was all of these things on sunday not in real life of course but in a video a video put together in advance and tweaked massaged and edited for days and days that hillary s presidential announcement video could be mistaken for a drug commercial was no accident americans want quick fixes better schools better jobs better housing a secure retirement a level playing field equal rights and equal opportunities for all also on politico michael crowley and nahal toosi everyday americans need a champion and i want to be that champion hillary says in the video which features everyday americans of all races ethnicities colors and creeds men hold hands and plan their marriages a senior citizen grows tomatoes two brothers tell us in spanish that they are starting a business a factory worker looks forward to a new job when families are strong america is strong hillary tells us so i m hitting the road to earn your vote because it s your time and i hope you ll join me on this journey at the end i expected to see a couple in separate bathtubs holding hands or maybe a blue pill with the voiceover hillary d take only as directed during your democratic caucus or primary side effects may include increased prosperity national security and unbridled joy the real ad was so good which is to say deftly exploitative it even had a moment of pure humor when a man says but most importantly we just want to teach our dog to quit eating the trash shot of dog eating the trash c mon that s funny just like hillary is funny right well not so fast there ads are not real life they are how we wish real life to be during the ad hillary is shown listening and nodding as ordinary voters talk to her which is the point this time around the campaign is not about hillary it is about us the american voter hillary is merely our champion and she desperately needs to hear our ideas thoughts positions and viewpoints so she can provide what we need which is why she is going on a listening tour of key caucus and primary states listening tours are a shopworn idea and also a pretty cynical one the candidate must pretend there are some things she does not know what does hillary not already know however hillary is ferociously well briefed for every event but how do you brief somebody to listen also on politico kenneth p vogel and humble can be hard to practice when you have spent your adult life being experienced if she was so ready to answer the 3 a m phone call and save the world eight years ago what is she unprepared for now no matter running for president is a performance and this time hillary is going to master the performance people will talk to her and she will nod and tell a scripted joke and that will get on local tv and only then will she be ready to deliver the big speech which is why she started her campaign on video and not in front of a real crowd of real people her campaign has worked enormously hard to lower expectations about hillary s ability to perform in person she must learn and prepare her handlers say oh puh leeze gimme a break hillary clinton had been making darn good big speeches for years remember her concession speech on june 7 2008 although we weren t able to shatter that highest hardest glass ceiling this time thanks to you it s got about 18 million cracks in it she told a roaring crowd at the national building museum in washington and the light is shining through like never before filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time well this is next time and you know what the path is a lot easier not just because hillary has kept in shape by knocking down quarter million dollar speeches for the past two years no this time the path is easier because for another democrat to beat her in iowa would take a miracle martin o malley or jim webb could catch fire there on a personal level iowans often admire scrappy candidates but what they lack is what barack obama had in 2008 millions and millions of dollars and an experienced campaign team that knew how to build the ground game that is essential to winning in iowa s arcane caucus process there are no absolute guarantees however and real listening is hard to learn on jan 26 2007 hillary began her previous listening tour in iowa more on politico at a town meeting in a high school gym in des moines a man who identified himself as a gulf war veteran asked her if the surge of new troops to iraq was going to be enough instead of answering hillary replied thanks so much for your service and then talked about how she visits military hospitals and believes america needs to provide good medical care for its veterans which is not what he asked in the one hour town meeting hillary did not mention iraq a single time she mentioned ethanol twice but today the iraq war is ancient history she hopes and all she has to do is appear to be humble and hilarious knowledgeable yet not all knowing last time before she went to that town hall meeting she went to democratic state headquarters to meet with party activists when asked about the war there she said there are no do overs in life oh but there are there have to be hillary clinton s future depends on it roger simon is politico s chief political
