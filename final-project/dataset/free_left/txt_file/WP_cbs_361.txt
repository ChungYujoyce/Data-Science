companies to hand over technology and unfairly subsidizes businesses beijing is trying to build into global leaders in robotics and other fields a stumbling block has been u s insistence on an enforcement mechanism with penalties to ensure beijing carries out its commitments odds of a settlement remain high said mark zandi of moody s analytics in a report but suddenly a number of other
