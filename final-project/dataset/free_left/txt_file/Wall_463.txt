advertisement supported by democrats shouldn t freak out just yet it s just as likely that in november he could hurt the president by liz mair ms mair is a republican strategist when representative justin amash a republican turned independent from michigan started a presidential exploratory committee on tuesday he caused immediate head exploding from partisans on both sides mr amash 40 intends to seek the libertarian party nomination forces opposed to donald trump on both the left and the right worry he will help the president win re election by pulling away votes that would otherwise go to joe biden undoubtedly too some backers of mr trump worry that voters who do not like the president but dislike democrats more will be tempted to back a third party candidate and deprive mr trump of votes they sees as rightfully his the truth will likely prove rather different mr amash s move should not have surprised anyone or caused any heads to explode and it is also far from clear if history is any guide that he will hurt mr biden more than mr trump what libertarians like me hope is that he enables a growing number of americans to register their dissatisfaction with the major parties and their policy agendas mr amash was elected to congress in 2010 in the tea party wave he has always been more of a libertarian than a conservative or a republican it s just that the republican party of 2010 was a decent fit for many libertarian minded americans mr trump s version is not sure we ve gotten some deregulation we got tax cuts many of us are pleased with the elevation of neil gorsuch to the supreme court but many of us remain outraged by gargantuan spending that kicked off well before the coronavirus crisis along with routine and increased disrespect by the executive for the rule of law and fundamental constitutional principles like separation of powers and checks and balances a lot of us are unhappy with mr trump s trade and immigration policies the more foreign policy focused among us typically perceive him as carrying on with u s interventionism as normal it was completely predictable and indeed completely logical that mr amash would not only leave the party as he did last year but given his vote for mr trump s impeachment and his obvious sustained outrage at the administration and the recent direction of the party that he would look at a third party challenge as a way of registering his dissatisfaction the libertarian party s nominee will almost certainly be on the ballot in all 50 states as was the case in 2016 the party s nominee that year former gov gary johnson of new mexico took 3 3 percent of the presidential vote winning 9 3 percent in his home state 5 2 percent in colorado and about 4 percent in arizona all states that both parties see as in play or want to put in play if mr amash is nominated he will become a headache for both parties one that many americans feel they have fully earned libertarian minded trump opponents worry however that this headache will afflict mr biden more than mr trump as much as mr biden is not to their taste on an array of policy issues there is a sense that he has fewer authoritarian instincts than mr trump and would represent some acceptable form of normalcy typical of the responses from many trump dubious libertarians following the amash announcement was this tweet from julian sanchez of the cato institute this is by a wide margin the person i d prefer be president but can we not do this right now maybe mr amash s percentages will be smaller than mr johnson s in 2016 mr trump is now a well known incumbent for better or worse but mr biden seems more likable and electorally viable for now anyway than hillary clinton ever did for many people the presumption that mr amash will hurt mr biden as much or even more than he will hurt mr trump looks questionable i worked to turn out votes for mr johnson in 2016 to protest the major parties by my rough estimate 50 percent of johnson voters would otherwise have voted for mrs clinton and 50 percent for mr trump if they were willing to vote for either at all there are arguments that third party candidates hurt mrs clinton but there are also arguments that mr johnson at least helped her if very slightly in 1992 ross perot was not on the ballot as a libertarian but he is known as one of the most famous spoilers in recent political history so his effects on the 1992 race remains worth a look as the times reported if mr perot had not been on the ballot 38 percent of his voters said they would have voted for gov bill clinton and 38 percent said they would have voted for george h w bush in pure electoral college terms though mr perot arguably helped mr clinton a little in 28 states where mr perot won 20 percent or more of the votes 17 went for mr clinton and 11 went for mr bush to the extent that anyone needs to be worrying about mr amash costing someone an election it s probably more the trump team than democrats mr amash s presidential toe dipping should most disturb people desperate for more members like him in congress for us the loss of a single libertarian minded congressman is a real blow in michigan mr amash will be on the ballot for re election to his house seat but he is not actively campaigning and observers believe that a republican candidate is favored to win the district in the fall there is one demographic that could complicate the picture in the state which was famously determined in 2016 by nearly 11 000 votes a large arab american population could mr amash the son of a palestinian refugee father and a syrian immigrant mother pull enough arab american voters from mr biden to tilt the state to mr trump it s doubtful at the moment in michigan mr biden holds a solid polling advantage over mr trump arab americans were in 2016 and are likely this year to remain quite anti trump in fact some conservative arab american republicans in the state could flip from mr trump to mr amash in 2020 libertarians will lose one of our most powerful voices in congress but maybe just maybe if the stars align we ll be able to cast a principled vote and send a message to the major parties liz mair
