margaret brennan we ll talk with two presidential hopefuls who took the stage minnesota senator amy klobuchar and former texas congressman beto o rourke all that coming up on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation we begin today with cbs news white house correspondent weijia jiang who is in seoul south korea where she has been covering the president s historic visit to north korea weijia jiang cbs news white house correspondent weijia good morning margaret the suspense over whether president trump and north korean dictator kim jong un would meet quickly turned into frenzy over a historic episode that lasted much longer than expected in fact even president trump admitted he was surprised the meeting happened at all president trump and kim walked toward each other from opposite sides of the joint security area in the dmz the demilitarized border zone that separates north and south korea after a handshake mister trump became the first u s sitting president to cross over the line of demarcation into north korea something he said he was proud to do then the two leaders met for nearly one hour and it all came about because of a tweet president trump sent yesterday inviting kim to the dmz to say hello and shake hands kim said he was surprised at the gesture and by the president s willingness to see him there president trump described the meeting as strong and solid and said negotiating teams would be meeting in the next two or three weeks to start crafting a deal for pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons he also said he would invite kim to the white house but did not provide a time frame for when margaret margaret brennan weijia jiang in seoul we go now to some analysis on this morning s events jean lee is director of the korea center at the wilson center and mike morell is a former acting director of the cia and cbs news senior national security contributor mike we know the president s national security team was opposed to this did the meeting strengthen or weaken the u s position michael morell former cia deputy director michaeljmorell cbs news senior national security contributor margaret two different perspectives here i think one is that a negotiated solution is the only solution to this problem there isn t a military option there s not a covert action option so getting back to talks with the north koreans is important and i think that s a good thing the second perspective though is this comes at a very high cost this gives kim jong un a lot of legitimacy this is gold for him politically at home and in the world and secondly this is going to weaken sanctions enforcement against north korea because if you re another country you re you re going to say to yourself my companies aren t don t need to pay a price they are now getting along you re going to step back a little bit so we re paying a price for this and it can t go on forever but let s see if we can get something out of these negotiations margaret brennan jean you ve lived you ve worked in north korea what does this do for kim jong un at home is he actually under much pressure to get things done jean lee the wilson center newsjean he is and that s a very important point it s so hard for us to tell what s happening inside north korea because they do such a good job of keeping us out and of framing the photo or the narrative of north korea but the fact is it is an extremely poor country and we may not get that sense when we see that he s pouring so much money into nuclear weapons we see these military parades and everything looks so organized and pyongyang looks so modern but we have to remember that they have an estimated gdp per person per year that is more along the lines of congo or some of the poorest countries in africa this is a country that is suffering and he knows that i do think he needs this and he wants this so for me it was only a matter of time that he would start he and president trump would start putting out feelers to get back to these nuclear negotiations i think there was a loss of faiths after hanoi and so he is looking for a chance to get back to that negotiating table margaret brennan but mike even though there may be that pressure on kim jong un and food shortages even he s still charging ahead with his nuclear program michael morell so two pieces to that one is he is still making fissile material so he is still adding to the nuclear stockpile but he is not testing nuclear weapons and he is not testing missiles you know we know he has nuclear weapons we know he has icbms capable of reaching the continental united states the one thing he has not demonstrated is the ability to mate those two together right he and he needs to test in order to to convince himself that he can do that let alone us so the fact that he s holding back on that is important but the stockpile continues to grow margaret brennan and jean you ve been watching some of what kim jong un is doing in the region he s been meeting with vladimir putin he s been meeting with xi jinping he has some powerful friends other than the united states right now so how much leverage does the u s have here jean lee in fact russia and china did support the round the latest round of u n security sanction security security council sanctions that have been such a chokehold on north korea s economy and i think that was a major blow to north korea and so he was going to putin and to xi to see if he could get some sanctions relief it doesn t sound like he got what he needed and so in that sense he is trying to tell his people at home look we do have i am meeting with them we have a good relationship they still have our back but it does mean that if he does continue to build those relationships with putin and xi it does take away from the leverage that president trump has i think that s something that we have to watch closely the way that kim jong un is very savvily playing all these different relationships in the region margaret brennan and mike it seems like the u s strategy has been to try to separate kim jong un from some of his more hardline old school advisors the idea that he is so unique and president trump is so unique that you could get this impossible deal even though the u s intelligence community says he is not going to give up his nukes what are the odds on this michael morell so i don t think there s any way he s going to give up the entire program i think the only possibility is significant limits on the number of nuclear weapons and the missile program probably the distance that missiles can fly that s the best we can hope for we should push for the whole thing but the best we can hope for is limits margaret brennan containment michael morell containment margaret brennan thank you very much we turn now to larry kudlow the national economic council director who joins us this morning from connecticut larry good to have you here the president said he s not increasing tariffs on china and he is allowing american companies to do business with huawei that essentially throws that tech firm a lifeline what did the u s get for these concessions larry kudlow national economic council director well let s first of all the talks are going to restart i think that s a very big deal right there no timeline margaret but they are going to restart look regarding the huawei story let me just try to clarify that there will be sales from american companies but but only in the sense of the general merchandise things that are available in other places around the world anything to do with national security concerns will not receive a new license from the commerce department i think that s very important i think people have to understand that stuff that s generally available will be will be probably getting a temporary license from the commerce department we ll see how far that goes second point is we are hoping and expecting that china will engage in large scale purchases of american farm products and farm services as the talks continue the talks may not be ending the talks may not even be solved but the president believes that china will begin to purchase american agriculture and that s going to be a big boost to our farmers and that would be a good faith show that these are serious talks and negotiations margaret brennan but on those purchases that you say might happen in the meantime the existing tariffs still stay in place so that means the retaliatory tariffs are too and even with this announcement of china potentially buying more product according to the usda that market for soybean farmers won t recover until 2026 or 2027 they re losing markets the longer this goes on so how much damage can america stomach larry kudlow well look that may be i don t want to forecast that we ll see if china steps in to fill the void our farmers have been terrific they re patriots they support the president s dealings with china pres strongest president we ve ever had in u s china relations china s problems you know ip theft forced transfers of technology problems with getting into cloud services problems with tariffs problems with non tariff barriers all these things are going to have to be addressed and that s the only way it will help the american economy it s a very unbalanced trading relationship margaret as you may know that has to be fixed it s not going to be fifty fifty they have many more remedies and correctives to make and that s what president trump said in his news conference and elsewhere in this recent trip to japan now having said that with respect to the farmers we are doing the best we can we are providing short term assistance to keep them going and try to fill the void until we can get better international markets the farmers themselves the farm groups they ve been great patriots and we we celebrate their support to make america s overall economy very very strong and let s see if the chinese make good on this promise that ll have a bearing you know the president said on tariffs let me make this point he said no additional tariffs for now so he s going good faith to see how these talks go to see if china delivers on an early agriculture promise let s call it an early harvest but that may be up for grabs we will see no one can predict with certainty margaret brennan but but last time my understanding is the talks were going well and then china backed off of a perceived promise to change its laws so is there any indication from china that they will make the kind of structural change to their own laws to make good on some of the changes you want to see happen on ip et cetera larry kudlow you re right about the problem and they did pull back from some agreements we thought we had and by the by that also includes all manner of enforcement to whatever conditions were made so you re quite right can i sit here and tell you that s all going to work out no we don t know that the teams are going to start negotiating in earnest ambassador lighthizer secretary mnuchin and others but we don t know margaret brennan okay larry kudlow this is just a new first step i always think it s better to talk than not to talk margaret brennan sure larry kudlow we have no assurances and again the president himself said several times we want quality talks there is no timeline here the issue is quality not speed margaret brennan well larry kudlow so we will see if china delivers on some of these significant reforms margaret brennan marco rubio has been raising concerns though about what the president just agreed to do with huawei that tech firm he said if president trump has bargained away recent restrictions on huawei then the u s congress will put them back in via legislation isn t this undercutting with the president s negotiation and why would the u s allow american companies to do business with a firm that is working on surveillance and a national security threat larry kudlow well look again i i i think senator rubio s concerns about all manner of national security are correct they re proper concerns and i hope that when president trump comes back that he and others of us will be able to persuade senator rubio that there will be no national security violations that any additional licensing from the commerce department to american companies will be for what we call general merchandise not national security sensitive general merchandise meaning you know various chips and software and other services that are available all around the world not specific to the u s but the president is not backing off on the national security concerns we understand the huge risks regarding huawei and let me say the president several times we will fully address huawei not until the end of the trade talks in other words margaret brennan right larry kudlow that will come last and that will deal you know with much larger issues concerning the long term future with huawei so that s what what s happening now is simply a a loosening up for general merchandise maybe some additional licenses from commerce it is not the last word the last word is not going to come till the very end of the talks this is a complicated matter so i hope we ll be able to persuade senator rubio and others that that that we are as cautious and concerned as they are margaret brennan all right larry kudlow thank you so much we ll be back in one minute with a lot more face the nation don t go away announcements margaret brennan welcome back we are now joined by minnesota senator and 2020 democratic presidential candidate amy klobuchar she joins us from minneapolis good morning senator senator amy klobuchar d minnesota amyklobuchar 2020 democratic presidential candidate thanks margaret hello margaret brennan we saw this historic moment with president trump stepping into north korea and i wonder if you re commander in chief would you continue the diplomacy that he has started senator amy klobuchar you always have to talk to everyone when it is american security and the world s security at stake but he keeps having these summits and meetings that really don t produce anything there s been a number of them now and this time you know you just can t look at this as going over and talking to your dictator next door and bringing them a hot dish over the fence there is a lot more and what this is about is making sure that there are measurable results that we have a plan when we go in there and we just haven t seen that in fact just in may you saw north korea launch another missile into the sea in violation of the u n resolution and to me you need to have a plan to denuclearize that peninsula or at least reduce those weapons immediately and i just don t see that happening yes but yet we know that talks are good but i just don t see this president when you look at what happened in iran when he got out of that agreement and we were ten minutes away from war and a month away from them blowing the caps when it comes to uranium enriching uranium when you look what he did with the nuclear agreement with russia he is constantly climate change pulling us back from working with margaret brennan mm hm senator amy klobuchar our allies to try to solve these problems margaret brennan you said there north korea would denuc denuclearize or at least need to reduce their arsenal would you accept them as a nuclear power senator amy klobuchar mm hm i no i would not what i am saying is you need to have steps and measures and you would could start there and then of course you have dates and you have times and you have a focus and you have a plan but that is not what he does he goes and gets a letter and says i love the guy you know right in the face of the warmbier s who lost their son otto so i am concerned just because of the track record here margaret brennan mm hm senator amy klobuchar talk is good but if all it is is talk it doesn t produce anything for national security for america and international security for our allies margaret brennan as commander in chief what would you do differently with china what leverage would you use to get them to capitulate on trade senator amy klobuchar i would first acknowledge to the american people very clearly the problem here the surveillance the intellectual property violations are basically stealing our blueprints what they have done when it comes to subsidizing industries and manipulating their currency the second thing that i would do is to work with our allies and to push them and i wouldn t have just walk away from every negotiating table months goes by i think you have to keep at it methodically and mostly i wouldn t have used the approach they ve used yes targeted tariffs but they have used basically a meat cleaver or maybe we should call it a tweet cleaver when it comes to how they re dealing with these other countries and when you talk to larry kudlow and he talked about the patriotism of our farmers i m in a very heavy ag state iowa my neighbor is a heavy ag state north dakota i ve talked to farmers in those areas and what they tell me is they re not going to get that soybean market back in one year because that market has gone to farmers in other countries and so that s why there s an urgency to this when we have an eight hundred ninety one billion dollar trade deficit margaret brennan mm hm senator amy klobuchar which is the worst that we ve seen you can t just keep talking about it you actually have to get it done margaret brennan you heard me ask larry kudlow about republican senators concerns about huawei you are a sitting senator would you vote to ban american companies from doing business with them senator amy klobuchar i don t think we should be doing business with them right now and i agree with my colleagues not just senator rubio but also senator warner mark warner who is the ranking on the intelligence committee that this is a major security risk for america you know you look at everything from china to russia using cyber against us it is the modern warfare we certainly know that from our elections in 2016 they may not use tanks or missiles but they can go after our electric grid they can go after our security in a very different way and so i don t know why he would just give that away right now i would think that he would put firm firm standards in place as part of any agreement with china and that s not what we have we just have another promise that they re going to buy american agriculture okay that s positive but i wouldn t give it up in that short term gain for the long term where we need to protect our security and our cybersecurity margaret brennan i want to ask you about the debates this week one question to many of your colleagues and competitors was whether their health care plan would cover undocumented immigrants would your plan do that senator amy klobuchar as part of comprehensive immigration reform we must move forward on making sure that people have health care california just did that with medicaid and i am supportive of that but i think on the national basis as we go forward get immediate health care for people yes but as part of making this actually happen you need comprehensive immigration reform and one thing that was missing from the nbc debate actually that i hope we can discuss is that we have humanitarian crisis at the border right now but we also did not talk about the other immigrants that are here margaret brennan mm hm senator amy klobuchar the people who are here on temporary legal status we ve got hundreds of thousands of people that are legally here that are at risk or are being deported that work in our nursing homes and our hospitals we have got dreamers two million of them that came to this country through no fault of their own and are a major part of our economy so we need to have an economic discussion about this as well as a border discussion margaret brennan okay so senator amy klobuchar and that s why i want to move forward as president with comprehensive immigration reform margaret brennan so that was a yes that your health care plan would cover senator amy klobuchar that was a yes margaret brennan okay senator amy klobuchar for immediate health care needs but as far as other benefits i think we need to that has got to be a part of the discussion of comprehensive immigration reform margaret brennan okay because they were excluded from the existing obamacare law senator amy klobuchar that is correct yes margaret brennan so you are i mean you you you call yourself a pragmatist you re in many ways senator amy klobuchar yes margaret brennan perceived as a moderate from the midwest do you feel sometimes that the rest of the party is is is leaving you behind that it s senator amy klobuchar no margaret brennan gone so progressive senator amy klobuchar i think i i i think i am thinking the issues you are focused here on for instance medicare for all and i want universal health care i just got a different way to get there and as i said in the debate i don t think that we should take away people s right to their private insurance and kick half of america off of their private insurance i think there is a better way to do this and that strengthening obamacare taking on the pharmaceuticals on free college for all i made it very clear i want to expand pell grants make it easier for kids to go to college but i don t think and that s what some of these plans do that we should be using taxpayer money to finance rich kids to go to college many of our public universities something like ten percent of the kids come from families that make over two hundred thousand dollars a year and i think that taxpayer money is better used to get free community college to help kids get certifications when those are some of the margaret brennan mm hm senator amy klobuchar fastest growing degree jobs we have in this nation and so to me this is a legitimate policy argument about how we help people afford college help them pay off their loans make bold policy changes which this president is not doing but i think there s room in our party for a legitimate debate i just think it s important to realize there s a lot more that unifies us than separate that there s a lot more that unifies us than there is that divides us and that divide right now margaret brennan mm hm senator amy klobuchar is with the american people and the president he promised them pharmaceutical prices going down they ve gone up he promised them infrastructure he has done margaret brennan okay senator amy klobuchar nothing he promised them a safer world when he got out of the iranian agreement it is not safer that s the case we need to make margaret brennan all right we ll look for you on that next debate stage thank you very much senator klobuchar senator amy klobuchar i am very much looking forward to it thank you margaret margaret brennan we ll be back in a moment announcements margaret brennan we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we are now joined by 2020 democratic presidential candidate beto o rourke who joins joins us from el paso congressman we ve had this breaking news overnight and i m wondering if as president you would continue the diplomacy with kim jong un and would you accept north korea as a contained nuclear threat if it refuses to give up its nuclear weapons beto o rourke 2020 democratic presidential candidate betoorourke you know i would continue diplomacy contingent on progress that keeps this country and our allies safe despite three years of almost bizarre foreign policy from this president this country is no safer when it comes to north korea they have removed none of their nuclear weapons or their potential to deliver them to the united states and in fact in contravention of the united nations they have launched other missiles flouting the diplomacy that this president has attempted so far so we ve added legitimacy to kim jong un margaret brennan but it sounds like you re saying you would continue to talk to kim jong un beto o rourke i want to make sure that we pursue diplomatic peaceful nonviolent negotiations to resolve the challenges that we face on the korean peninsula margaret brennan okay beto o rourke and to ensure that we denuclearize that area margaret brennan we know from your team that you plan to go to mexico today what is the purpose of that visit beto o rourke me going over to ciudad juarez today our our sister city across the border from el paso to meet with asylum seekers who have traveled hundreds in some cases thousands of miles fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet coming to this country trying to follow our asylum laws and through a program that effectively shuts them out of this country and our laws are forced to stay in ciudad juarez where they are prey to criminal organizations where they are penniless and where they are suffering and where too many feel like they are forced to try to cross in between our ports of entry as we saw earlier this week a picture of oscar and valeria who died trying to do that from matamoros to brownsville this inhumane policy is causing suffering and death and i want to call attention to what we are doing so going to ciudad juarez mexico and meeting with these asylum seekers is a great way for the american public to know what is being done in our name right now margaret brennan so do you believe that asylum seekers should be able to apply for asylum from other countries or from mexico beto o rourke yes i i think we should follow our our own asylum laws that are on the books our obligations to those people to whom we are connected by land and language and culture and for whom we have some responsibility given our involvement in the western hemisphere that has produced some of the challenges that they face that would cause a family to flee hundreds or thousands of miles to come here so when we follow our own asylum laws those people are safer we live according to our traditions and in a program that we ve proposed a family case management program no family is separated they re not detained in these border patrol stations margaret brennan but that s if they cross into the united states beto o rourke they re able to be released into the community and to follow our own laws margaret brennan what what you re proposing is when they cross into the united states i m asking if they re applying as now from mexico or from a third country that is one of the proposed changes also to immigration law now beto o rourke yes i i think that asylum seekers should be able to apply from their home countries so margaret brennan okay beto o rourke from honduras or guatemala or el salvador to the united states without having to make that journey by foot in the first place it will ensure that they are following our laws and it will guarantee greater safety and reduce suffering for them margaret brennan we are just about a month out from the next debate during the one this week you were hit by your colleague from texas julian castro who said you need to do your homework are you going to change your strategy for the next debate beto o rourke what i m going to do is get across what i think we can do as a country and on the particular issue that you re referring to on on immigration under my administration day one we are going to stop family separation we re going to reunite those families who have been separated we re going to make sure that that no one who is fleeing persecution or violence is criminally prosecuted and we re going to follow what i was doing in congress where we helped to introduce legislation that would stop this and rewrite section 1325 of u s code to make sure that those families who are at their most desperate and vulnerable moment do not face further fear when they get to the united states and then in addition we re going to rewrite our immigration laws from the ground up that the nine million green card holders in this country we re going to waive their citizenship fees so they can contribute even more to our success and our greatness margaret brennan you ll be reliant on bending republicans to your will on that beto o rourke well i i m not so sure that i m willing to concede that point there are a lot of great candidates running for congressional seats and u s senate seats across this country i m confident that 2020 is going to produce a significant change not just in the white house but in both houses of congress i think that democratic majority on immigration on health care on a more inclusive economy on confronting the challenge of climate before it s too late is going to be able to show success for the american people at this defining moment of truth margaret brennan wonderful thank you so much congressman o rourke we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan yesterday we spoke with senator lindsey graham who joined us from istanbul turkey we do want to caution you there will be a graphic image that some may find disturbing we began our conversation by asking senator graham for his take on the president s decision to remove the ban on american companies selling goods to chinese tech giant huawei senator lindsey graham r south carolina judiciary committee chairman lindseygrahamsc well it s a lot of leverage because huawei is a huge chinese company and it really is owned by the chinese government it s not a private sector company as we would know it microsoft came into my office trying to make sure that they could sell some technology to china that would not compromise our national security so i don t know what he agreed to regarding exceptions to the ban if they re minor exceptions that s okay but if we re selling huawei major technology that would be a mistake margaret brennan but you don t worry that this is too much of a concession on national security grounds senator lindsey graham i don t know yet it s clearly a concession there will be a lot of pushback if this is a major concession if it s a minor concession i think it s part of the overall deal margaret brennan we know president trump did meet with president erdogan at the g20 as well and he seems to have the impression that president trump said there will not be u s sanctions if turkey goes ahead and buys russian made weapons systems is that the case senator lindsey graham well i m in turkey and it s being reported in the turkish media that president erdogan is claiming that president trump in their discussions told turkey that if you activate the s 400 we ll find a way around sanctions i doubt if that conversation occurred it s impossible under our law if turkey buys the activates the s 400 missile battery they bought from the russians sanctions would be required under law and we also a couple of days ago passed legislation banning the sale of the f 35 to turkey if they activate the russian s 400 missile battery there is no way we re going to transfer to turkey the f 35 technology and let them buy a russian missile battery at the same time it would compromise our platform margaret brennan but you re not saying sanctions are inevitable at this point you see a way around them some kind of compromise senator lindsey graham i hope so but under our law there is no discretion if they activate the s 400 russian missile battery they will be sanctioned under u s law and the f 35 technology cannot be transferred to turkey we need to find a way out of this dilemma margaret brennan i m sure you saw that video of presidents putin and trump seeming to laugh when asked about election meddling did that concern you senator lindsey graham what concerns me is are we going to be ready for their meddling next time i ve seen this administration up their game in 2018 we had a midterm election without a whole lot of interference because we re we re upping our game so to speak so it was clearly a joke margaret brennan but last time you were on this program you said russia did not learn its lesson so when you see this joking about something so serious regarding an upcoming election doesn t that counter everything senator lindsey graham yeah margaret brennan in terms of a hard line the rest of the national security security community is trying to send senator lindsey graham yeah i m not so sure rebuking putin in in front of a bunch of cameras does much good what hurts him is when you hit him in the polic pocketbook his oligarch friends are having a hard time placing their money around the world we put tremendous sanctions on the russian economy particularly in the energy area and it s biting russia so actions mean more than anything in this part of the world margaret brennan do you believe that president trump embracing saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman undermines the u s credibility on human rights senator lindsey graham yeah i don t think it helps i led the effort to sanction m b s the crown prince there is no doubt in my mind that he ordered the killing of mister khashoggi that he knew about it that he s done things like that to other people and that he s been a disruptive force throughout the region so i m in a completely different place when it comes to m b s margaret brennan here at home i know you ve been working with the president s son in law jared kushner and some democrats as well to try to find some compromise around asylum laws the president said that he will go through with rounding up migrants after the july fourth holiday do you see any legislative compromise senator lindsey graham yes i do i ve spent about an hour with speaker pelosi and here s the compromise we ll start turning the aid back on to central america it is in our national security interest to help the triangle northern triangle nations with their economy with their rule of law problems but if you don t turn off the magnets that attract people which is our asylum laws if you don t reform them they will keep coming all you have to do is to put one foot on the united states soil if you re from central america with a small child you re not going to get deported margaret brennan on that question of children it it was that image of that el salvadorian father who drowned along with his two year old daughter that really captured a lot of attention this week that was his child that was not a tool to exploit the asylum system by warning that asylum is going to get tougher and saying that the border might close doesn t that incentivize people that take the risk in the first place senator lindsey graham good question here s what i think and i don t know and it does break your heart to see that image and the thought that went into it here s what i think the father believed if we can just make it across the rio grande and i can put one foot in america my child and myself are going to be in america and we re not going to get sent back i would like that asylum claim to be made in mexico at a u n center so that this father doesn t have to risk him and his child drowning in the future asylum claims should be made in the home country or in a facility in mexico because the reason he tried to go across the river he was told by people in central america if you can put one foot on american soil you re home free and this is a tragic result of that policy margaret brennan i want to quickly ask you about your friend joe biden how do you think he performed in the democratic debate this week senator lindsey graham he s got to up his game but anybody that knows joe biden there s not a racist bone in his body that s not a cliche that s a reality but the narrative is that maybe it s not his time and that he s not up to the task i think you will esti underestimate joe biden at your own peril i watched the debate the policy options being presented to the country by the leading contenders on the democratic side are their biggest problem pretty liberal pretty extreme but when it comes to joe biden i think the next debate he s got to change the narrative and one thing i ll say about kamala harris and i said this before she s got game she is very talented she s very smart and she will be a force to be reckoned with margaret brennan senator graham thank you very much for your time senator lindsey graham thank you margaret brennan we ll be right back with more from our political panel announcements margaret brennan it s time now for some political analysis edward wong is a diplomatic correspondent at the new york times shannon pettypiece is a white house correspondent of bloomberg news ramesh ponnuru is a senior editor at the national review and a columnist at bloomberg opinion and antjuan seawright is a political strategist thank you all for joining us antjuan this was a big week for for you and fellow democrats in terms of the first round out of the debates what is your takeaway what needs to change between now and when they take the stage in july antjuan seawright political strategist antjuansea i think our candidates have to realize that they are running for our party s nomination and not against each other and i think that s such an important point because what we saw during the debate was some heated fellowship among some of our candidates but i think the the focus was lost on the big picture and that is we have a race to run next year against the republicans i also think that we have to again probably sing a little louder on the quality of life issues like health care like the economy like housing all of the things that democratic votes are hungry and thirsty for and not just democratic voters independent thinkers independent voters and even some of those voters who may have voted for the president in 16 but voted for democrats in 2018 margaret brennan and ramesh what you just heard from senator graham was he characterized the debate stage as you know too extreme for those who are those triers those people in the middle maybe even some republicans who aren t comfortable with president trump is there anyone yet who they feel comfortable voting for on that stage ramesh ponnuru national review rameshponnuru bloomberg opinion well i think that the democrats right now the candidates are not concentrating on swing voters they re not concentrating certainly on persuadable republicans and the process of winning the primaries may be pushing them too far to the left on some issues look i think the the trump reelection campaign had a very good week not because of anything the president did but the frontrunner joe biden got dinged in the debate three of his top rivals came out for outlining the kind of health insurance that two hundred million americans rely on they are they are on a in a race to the left on immigration all of these things are going to make people who don t necessarily love everything that the president does think i don t know if i m comfortable with this other side antjuan seawright but but but margaret to one point we saw very few people between the two nights quote unquote play with that this idea of what the republicans and some in the right wing media called liberal what we saw i think holistically was a real center left type of approach to how we govern and what a policy agenda looks like there s only two people on wednesday night who raised their hand for medicare for all and i think it may have been two on thursday night so this idea that the party is driving the car to the left i think is just a false narrative one that the republicans are pushing because they know it plays well to their base but two the media some in the media are pushing this narrative because it s good for political conversation that does not make it true margaret brennan mm hm ramesh ponnuru warren sanders and harris are three of the top candidates and they re all for outlining this kind of private health insurance that most americans rely on margaret brennan shannon picking up shannon pettypiece bloomburg news spettypi right margaret brennan pick it up there with do you see it as a good week for the trump reelection campaign shannon pettypiece everything went exactly as the campaign had hoped it would and as they expected it would whether they have really gone to the left or not the trump campaign will use those moments from the debate to make it look like they moved to the left whether swing voters are watching the debate or not they will cut moments from that debate and use them in campaign ads that to them this was a television commercial against the democrats for their 2020 campaign so it it went exactly as they wanted and i and on the expectation point they expected biden to be a bit off his game they ve been sort of talking their advisers have been talking for a while about feeling like joe biden today isn t joe biden of 2012 they expected warren to be strong they re concerned by her sort of authenticity and on message brand and i think kamala did catch some by surprise though margaret brennan ed one of the factors here for any big geopolitical calculations is who s going to be in the oval office edward wong the new york times ewong right margaret brennan after 2020 there is this perception that whether it s kim jong un or leadership in iran that they re waiting out president trump is that factoring into some of what we re saying edward wong right i think with iran it s be they ve been put in difficult position because the sanctions really are hurting iran so i think they have wanted to try and hold out for a change of commander in chief in 2020 now you re seeing them push back a little bit in the persian gulf because they think they might not be able to wait out that the sanctions that long kim kim is a different position i think he has nuclear weapons he wants to be able to keep them and as long as he keeps trump talking in this sort of diplomatic sort of round robin game then i think he feels comfortable because he gets to keep his weapons maybe trump eases up on sanctions and in the end that s what kim wants and that s what as we heard mike morell said that might be what the u s needs in terms of pushing forward on on diplomacy and maybe the in the long run you ratchet back the tensions but right now you do need some diplomatic opening margaret brennan as one source said to me kim jong un has to look at this and say no president but president trump would take this level of risk of meeting with me edward wong right margaret brennan so maybe there s a narrow window of opportunity but you heard senator amy klobuchar on here say well maybe he would just reduce the number of nuclear weapons that s different than full denuclearization edward wong right the margaret brennan are we seeing him he he s kind of shopping for options edward wong i think the stated policy is full denuclearization i think what we re seeing in this administration maybe in a future administration is that there might have to be a tacit acceptance of the fact that north korea is a nuclear power it s unstated like with israel but but that these administrations will have to accept that and figure out how to deal with the nuclear north korea margaret brennan i want to go to you antjuan on this next i want to play for all of you what former vice president joe biden came out the day after the debate and said regarding his past record on forced busing joe biden i want to be absolutely clear about my record and position on racial justice including busing i never never never ever opposed voluntary busing margaret brennan how big of a misstep was this truly antjuan seawright i don t know if it was a misstep but i do think the vice president and his team are going to have to make some adjustments going forward look this country and our party has been shaped by the experiences of joe biden and kamala harris and i think we can t lose sight of that but i also think that we can t ignore or turn the volume down on how the experiences of kamala harris and how she s been impacted by this throughout her life but i will also say that sometimes a moment doesn t mean it s transferable to several moments in the future and i think that s what we all have to keep in mind this was one debate joe biden has a strong body of work on issues that have been pro civil rights and for the improvement of quality life for african americans just like senator harris and i think we just have to get back focused to the big picture and that is quality of life issues and how we go forward margaret brennan shannon the issue racial issues though are coming up on on the trump side of things as well donald trump jr sent out a tweet this week that questioned whether kamala harris was quote an american black shannon pettypiece right it almost sounds reminiscent of the birther argument antjuan seawright absolutely shannon pettypiece as many people have pointed out in 2016 and of course with an administration that does not have a great track record with race and has really worked to try and overcome the people good people on both sides image they are trying to sell hard the economic argument about black unemployment hispanic unemployment you know cri criminal justice reform but i do think they miss sometimes that with issues of race it s not always dollars and cents and it s not always about you know we give you money and jobs there is a you know a a moral sense here and a a sense of self too that if you degrade people in that way no matter what you can give them financially it s not going to overcome that margaret brennan ramesh do we need to hear from more republicans on this most of all the democrat competitors to kamala harris have come out in support of her ramesh ponnuru well i don t think that republicans are afraid of having an argument about busing in the 1970s let s recall busing was unpopular with white americans margaret brennan but on this issue ramesh ponnuru not terribly popular among black americans it s bizarre that the democrats have latched on to this if they re not i mean it s not like they re trying to bring it back on the republican side you ve got the fundamental problem that you ve got a presidency that is not especially sensitive on racial matters not necessarily thinking about a demographic future with the changing racial composition of this country and you ve got congressional republicans who don t really want to take him on that s just the way it s been for three years now antjuan seawright margaret your question was about margaret brennan the tweet antjuan seawright the
