bricks and gasoline bombs toward the police the result was a surreal scene of small fires and scattered paving bricks on the street between the two sides rising clouds of tear gas and green and blue laser lights pointed by the protesters at the police the protesters eventually decided to abandon their position two water cannon trucks and a phalanx of police vehicles with flashing lights joined riot police on foot as they advanced up the street they met little resistance television footage showed a water cannon being fired once but perhaps more as a test as it didn t appear to reach the

defend themselves as they retreated police said that one officer fell to the ground and six drew their pistols after they were surrounded with one firing the warning shot some protesters said they re
