lynchburg va sen ted cruz r texas announced again his candidacy for president in a speech monday morning at a landmark of the american evangelical movement liberty university today i am announcing that i am running for president of the united states cruz said about 20 minutes into a speech to students here ted ted students yelled it is the time for truth it is the time for liberty it is the time to reclaim the constitution of the united states cruz said cruz s speech had the feel of a sermon at a megachurch with the candidate wearing a wireless microphone and walking around a stage while delivering his remarks he discussedthe humble background of his parents how his wife is the daughter of missionaries and how he took out 100 000 in student loans that he only paid off a few years ago he talked about the power of the american dream and harnessing the grassroots to propel his campaign forward i want to talk to you this morning about reigniting the promise of america he said the speech embraced the goals of christian social conservatives military hawks and small government tea partiers and illustrated the broad republican coalition he is hoping to assemble the location of the announcement at an evangelicalcollege showed that cruz hopes to mobilize young people behind a campaign that will start at the back of the gop pack but a position advisers said they feel good about because they can build upon by aggressively courting the conservative base an adviser to cruz said the speech was meant to highlight the optimistic side of cruz which often gets lost amid his reputation as a senate bomb thrower it s an approach that cruz will continue on the campaign trail as he looks to accentuate a positive message of moving america forward and uniting conservatives behind his campaign at the same time he will continue to position himself as someone who has and is willing to take on both parties and is uncompromising in his beliefs cruz has called for the repeal of the affordable care act and the abolition of common core education standards and has been skeptical of climate change cruz had technically already announced his candidacy with a tweet sent early monday morning part of a targeted multi day rollout by the campaign they had considered announcing online only cruz decided about a month ago to declare here at liberty underscoring that he has beenassiduously courting evangelicals and conservatives who are frustrated with republicans in washington and young people i m running for president and i hope to earn your support he wrote just after midnight that made cruz who has been in the senate since 2013 the first major presidential contender to formally declare himself a 2016 candidate it followed several months of fervent but entirely unofficial jockeying by cruz and a large field of other republican hopefuls i m running for president and i hope to earn your support pic twitter com 0utqaioytp on monday cruz said it again even more officially in person at the convocation ceremony at liberty university a required event for students enrolled there we stand together for liberty cruz said this is our fight the answer will not come from washington it will come when the american people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that made this country great cruz began his speech with a discourse about his parents describing his mother s childhood in delaware and his father s escape from cuba he drew from their stories lessons about the power of christianity which cruz said he convinced his father to return after abandoning his family and about american freedom his father s experience in cuba cruz said had taught him how fragile liberty is the student audience was buoyant cheering like a concertcrowdwhen cruz mentioned their home states texas california delaware orvirginia icon patrick henry or his own student loan debt or the idea of abolishing the irs they booed loudly when cruz mentioned president obama s health care law which was signed five years ago today cruz moved around the stage urging students to imagine scenarios in which conservative ideals prevailed on a variety of policy issues imagine no obamacare imagine no common core education curriculum instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life and to uphold the sacrament of marriage he said focusingon evangelical priorities as well as secular conservativeones instead of a government that works to undermine our second amendment rights that seeks to ban our ammunition imagine a federal government that protects the right to keep and bear arms of all law abiding americans it wasn t your imagination ted cruz said imagine a lot in his announcement speech cruz drew parallels with moments in american history the american revolution the great depression the election of ronald reagan in 1980 he said reagan helped win the cold war and revive the american economy compared to that repealing obamacare and abolishing the irs ain t all that tough cruz said ted cruz just launched his presidential campaign who s next earlier cruz
