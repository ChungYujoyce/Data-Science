 if we nominate trump we will get destroyed and we deserve it lindsey graham the republican party has put itself in an impossible position for months they ve told us over and over and over again how unstable trump is how unfit for office he is they ve told us he s a con artist a clown a bigot now that he s decimated their party now that s he toppled every hackneyed candidate he s faced they re forced to perform an about face and endorse him as their nominee for president it won t work and no one will buy it hillary clinton s campaign has already done the easy work of compiling the statements made by republicans about trump the result predictably is brutal in less than 90 seconds we hear mostly from other republican presidential candidates why trump is a menace who must be stopped here s a few highlights he is a con artist marco rubio donald trump is the know nothing candidate george pataki this is an individual who mocked a disable reporter who attributed a reporter s question to her menstrual cycle mitt romney the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency marco rubio the man who only feels big when he s trying to make other people feel small carly fiorina the man is utterly amoral a narcissist at a level i don t this country has ever seen ted cruz he s a race baiting xenophobic religious bigot this guy is so unfit to be commander in chief lindsey graham he needs therapy jeb bush some party elders will have the dignity to follow their conscience and hold to their convictions both george w bush and george h w bush for instance informed the hill that they do not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential race neither bush attended the previous convention but the decision not to comment at all is revealing it says as clearly as possible we can t support donald trump for president others like south carolina gov nikki haley who accused trump of cynically exploiting an angsty public during her response to the obama s state of the union address are already falling into line i have great respect for the will of the people she told the charleston post and courier and as i have always said i will support the republican nominee for president she quickly added however that she s not interested in serving as vice president and there will be many republicans like sen kelly ayotte of new hampshire and former florida gov bob martinez who know trump is cartoonishly unqualified but nevertheless support his candidacy from a new york times report this morning senator kelly ayotte of new new hampshire who is in a tough re election race signaled that she would support mr trump but not endorse him as a spokeswoman put it a rhetorical contortion that other republicans repeated privately representative raul r labrador of idaho a staunch conservative said he would support mr trump but derided him for not knowing much about the constitution or politics former gov bob martinez of florida who retains a strong network of donors said he would raise money for mr trump but was unsure about his proposals like temporarily banning foreign muslims from entering the united states this is what happens when politicians put re election or party over the moral imperative to do right by the country you can t say in good faith that trump doesn t know anything about the constitution or politics but that you support him nonetheless this is the presidency after all it s rather important that the candidate know such things nor is there any room to equivocate about trump s proposal to ban all muslims from entering the country it s both wrong and unconstitutional republicans let this monster into their house he s their problem they have a responsibility to do what s right the stakes are too high to do otherwise if they choose blind fidelity to the party over their obligation to the country they ve lost the right to call themselves public servants sean illing is a usaf veteran who previously taught philosophy and politics at loyola and lsu he is currently salon s politics writer follow him on facebook and twitter read his blog here email at silling salon com copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
