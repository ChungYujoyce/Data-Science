 2016 hillary clinton s running mate is viewed as a deal maker not an attack dog by burgess everett and darren samuelsohn 07 24 2016 08 22 am edt sen tim kaine has been described by his republican colleagues in the senate as very bipartisan and well respected getty miami tim kaine is not going to be an easy target for republicans after all they all but love the guy as a rank and file democratic senator kaine has shown deal making tendencies with top gop lawmakers and an affinity for breaking with his own party that s earned him respect across the aisle advertisement those traits would make him especially valuable as hillary clinton s vice president the virginia senator would be her line into senate republicans a direct conduit to a group that s been extraordinarily reluctant to work with president barack obama kaine s most high profile achievement is work in the trenches on a bill that allowed congress a vote on obama s nuclear deal with iran working with more conservative democrats and deal cutting republicans kaine helped drive a 98 1 vote in the senate effectively forcing obama to sign it and begin the task of lining up democrats to support it in a roll call vote he s sort of biden lite on the engagement with the hill said south carolina republican sen lindsey graham who s been part of negotiating groups with kaine on iran and preventing terrorists from buying guns tim would be a good steady hand for her he d be well received on our side of the aisle if he s an emissary from the president but it s not just aisle crossing republicans like graham who kaine knows well he s also rubbed shoulders with the senate s conservative firebrand class upon entering the senate kaine began getting to know texas sen ted cruz who would later run for president as a rock ribbed hero of the right and is perhaps the least compromising lawmaker in the halls of the capitol 2016 by nolan d mccaskill after being oriented together as part of the class of 2012 kaine dined with cruz at the house of independent maine sen angus king and the two have spoken regularly about books and legal issues we get along great kaine said of cruz in an interview in 2014 reported for the first time here we ve socialized together took dinners sometimes he and i together just the two of us sometimes with others we re often disagreeing but we re both serious about our work in his first rally with clinton in south florida on saturday kaine s centrism was in the background as the democratic party digested the selection of a senator who has been amenable to new trade deals and occasionally out of step with liberals on abortion issues clinton and kaine instead talked up immigration reform and health care expansion red meat for a crowd of revved up partisans and here s how we re going to continue that work with a strong progressive agenda kaine said emphatically close friends don t expect kaine to advertise his bipartisan leanings in front of most audiences he won t be talking about reaching across the aisle but he s got a record of doing it said sen chris coons a delaware democrat despite his reputation among senate republicans at his core kaine is an ally of democratic leaders and obama he eventually supported the president s iran deal as did all but four senate democrats but initially the administration and its allies on the hill were reluctant to even put the iran deal up for a vote a vote that the gop was clamoring for kaine s blessing for a congressional review helped drive other capitol hill democrats to the bill but also had a side benefit for democrats kaine s work with foreign relations chairman bob corker r tenn made it more difficult for the gop to try and amend the bill with conservative goodies the greatest example you can point to is the role he played in fashioning the iranian compromise said sen heidi heitkamp of north dakota among the most conservative democrats in congress it illustrates some of the work he s always done behind the scenes that you may not see every day indeed the parade of cheers among some senate republicans is more enthusiastic for clinton s vp selection than for gop presidential nominee donald trump pennsylvania republican sen pat toomey who has not endorsed trump praised kaine as a good choice for the democratic ticket and highlighted all the work they ve done together on fighting opioid addiction sugar subsidies and keeping people with mental illnesses from obtaining guns by doug palmer corker an increasingly vocal trump backer deemed the selection of kaine as solid he s very bipartisan said sen john mccain r ariz well respected chimed in sen lamar alexander r tenn but the most hard core partisans quickly moved to light up kaine one of president obama s most loyal yes men in the senate said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell there s likely to be more negativity toward kaine as the campaign progresses and he could lose his bipartisan sheen over the weekend conservative outside groups tried to sow discord between liberals and the clinton kaine ticket by highlighting positions that could rankle progressives i don t see how he can escape coming out of it as more partisan said mike thomas who ran former republican sen george allen s campaign against kaine in 2012 in the senate kaine s collegial manner is a throwback to another era he s a liberal leaning lawmaker who simultaneously realizes that 60 votes are needed in the senate and that his purple state status means he needs to come off the sidelines but perhaps even more than kaine s yearning for big fiscal deals and bipartisan agreements on foreign policy his bipartisan brand of politics is driven by his belief that the senate should vote on tough issues it s not always welcomed by other washington democrats party leaders ignored his frequent calls for holding a vote on authorizing the war against the islamic state and corker eventually shot down the idea after a retinue of media showed up with him to an otherwise dry foreign relations hearing last november at which kaine tried to force the issue kaine also disagreed publicly with obama over whether the white house could escalate its presence in syria and iraq without congress blessing it won him new respect from republicans for taking such a bold position the president shouldn t be doing this without congress kaine said in a 2014 speech at the center for american progress widely viewed as a rare rebuke of obama congress shouldn t be allowing it to happen without congress by politico staff sen jeff flake r ariz eventually worked hand in hand with kaine to introduce a draft bill that was shunned by both parties but it had the benefit of deepening the relationship between the first term senators trying to count the ways i hate kaine drawing a blank congrats to a good man and a good friend flake said after kaine was selected by clinton flake has yet to endorse trump sen jeff flake trying to count the ways i hate kaine drawing a blank this summer as the speculation around kaine as clinton s running mate swirled around him kaine was still advocating for a vote on the trans pacific partnership a trade deal with other pacific rim nations that clinton helped negotiate but now opposes shortly after kaine was selected as her running mate he announced he d vote against it but suspicions among the left are unlikely to be immediately quelled by that assurance but kaine is no scourge of the left just a few weeks ago kaine s work with rank and file republicans also put gop leaders in a tough spot kaine collaborated with republicans like graham flake kelly ayotte of new hampshire and susan collins of maine to write a bill that created a small list of suspected terrorists that could be blocked from buying firearms he was very helpful collins said i believe his participation was instrumental in convincing other democrats to give their support to the compromise the bill eventually stalled under strong opposition from mcconnell but it ended up pitting conservatives like ayotte and flake against the nra an unusual occurrence that happened in part because of kaine s deep gop relationships behind that smile tim also has a backbone of steel clinton said saturday just ask the nra missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your
