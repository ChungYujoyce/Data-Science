the democratic establishment is putting all the heat it can onbernie sanders to drop his weapons and put his hands where we can see them this includes the media establishment last monday politico ran a piece headlined democrats to sanders time to wind it down quoting a bunch of senators who said bernie could stay in so long as he talks just about stuff he and hillary agree on claire mccaskill if the contrast is about what separates us from donald trump then i think it s fine if they can t end the race they ll settle for ending the debate a times story headlined obama privately tells donors time is coming to unite behind hillary had obama telling dnc high rollers to come together in it obama didn t explicitly call on sanders to quit but a white house official confirmed his unusually candid words it was a plant dressed up as a scoop obama spoke not privately but on background and not to his donors but through them and the paper to his base it was a different portrait of obama as unifier political financial and media elites all working as one to put down a revolt obama s neutrality is a polite scam his private chat came before voters in 29 states even had their say presidents never let appointees makeendorsements but three obama cabinet secretaries agriculture s tom vilsack hud s julian castro and labor s thomas perez backed clinton early thus shepherding whole economic sectors into her camp at obama s dnc ethically challenged debbie wasserman schultz brazenly violates party rules by daily rigging the game for clinton sanders often says he took on the most powerful political machine in america by which he means the clintons he s really fighting the whole democratic party white house congress dnc elite media and sad to say national progressive groups that includes organized labor but alsonearly every liberal lobby in town he s been a more constant friend than hillary clinton to almost all of them but he must face and defeat them all that he s done so in 14 states 15 counting iowa and fought four more to a draw is a miracle and a sign their days are truly numbered donald trump has accomplished little by comparison everything was easier for him when he hit party elites no one hit back democratic elites had a flawed but still formidable clinton to carry their water republicans had jeb bush and now ted cruz trump took the low road and then lowered it some more yet could help himself to issues of broad populist appeal without an establishment type feigning agreement the media that ignored or dismissed sanders coddled and appeased trump eight years of open gop warfare prepared trump s way bernie s in the first wave to hit the democratic beach with each call to surrender sanders just gets stronger the day the politico story ran he swept democrats abroad 69 percent to 30 percent the next day hillary took arizona with 58 percent of the vote but sandersblew her out in idaho and utah polling an unheard of 79 percent in caucuses that shattered turnout records on saturday he d chalked up three more wins in alaska hawaii and washington with average margins of 76 perfent in a times cbs poll out this week the man who started the race 60 points down closed the gap to five in a bloomberg poll released saturday he took a 1 point lead it raises a question that the elites who rig rules stifle debate and call on sanders to withdraw must answer who do you think you are it also raises a question for washington based organizations allegedly safeguarding progressive values what have you done with all her money contacts and celebrity and full albeit covert support of her president and party clinton needed every last liberal endorsement to survive iowa nevada missouri illinois and massachusetts how did she get them if those endorsements don t strike you as at least counterintuitive ponder the record clinton backed nafta and the tpp dithered on the minimum wage and still doesn t support a living wage why would labor help her defeat a man who never once left its side on these and countless other vital issues she backed the defense of marriage actin the 90s opposed same sex marriage till 2013 and recently recalled nancy reagan as a hero of the aids crisis the human rights campaign may be the bravest and most loyal of all liberal lobbies why abandon a stalwart ally like sanders for one who dithered and dodged on every tough issue from sister souljah in 1992 to barack obama in 2008 the clinton record on racial politics is highly mixed she backed the clinton gingrich welfare bill that left millions of african americans in poverty and the clinton crime bill that landed millions more in jail why did a pac run in the name of the congressional black caucus pick her over a guy who went to jail to protest segregated housing the answers are many and complicated one is that some once great grass roots movements pledged their troth to a political party and lost touch with their values and their members led by hired technicians and assorted other washington lifers many froze members out of their decisions it s a big part of the story but not the whole story another part pertains to ideology and the tyranny of tactical thinking ideology is easy to spot in those we deem extremist it s harder to see in those we deem centrist all ideologues think their ideology is empirical engels called his scientific socialism but centrists get away with it we call their shared ideology neoliberalism its adherents include deficit hawks military interventionists market deregulators free traders and the key to it all pay to play politicians this ideology is bipartisan without the full support of democratic elites nafta the tpp the iraq war wall street deregulation every revolving door and no bid contract every cut ever made to social security or medicare would be impossible the culture wars we so loudly deplore are mostly a sideshow staged by political elites to hold onto their base while conducting their business this election exposes the real divide in american politics the one separating us from them neoliberal politics is entirely tactical and tactical thinking is static most people oppose wall street crooks mideast ground wars and cuts to social security so they talk endlessly about what the congress they ve corrupted won t pass and what other voters allegedly won t support neoliberals love horse race politics because it never favors reform polls favor known quantities endorsements go to people in power money to those willing to reward the investment tacticians rely on marketing tools made to manipulate not illuminate since global finance capitalism runs on pay to play politics neoliberals promise change but can never deliver reform they can t talk us out of wanting a living wage or universal health care so they argue tactics change is impossible because someone else doesn t want it we can t afford it even though it saves us money the tyranny of tactical thinking surely led some progressives to clinton despite knowing she d likely let them down again it even infects the minds of voters in hopes of catching a democratic ear or two i ll illustrate the point using polls eight month ago bernie was a stranger to democrats in a recent cnn poll his popularity among them surpassed clinton s 85 percent 10 percent versus 76 19 the times poll shows the gap widening in it 56 percent of dems say if he s the nominee they ll support him enthusiastically just 40 percent say the same of her on issues his lead is far greater that swhy she mimics him rather than the other way around yet this is the same poll in which she beats him by 5 percent some democrats who prefer him vote for her i put it down to tactical thinking in that same poll 72 percent of democrats say regardless of how they feel she ll be the nominee seventy eight percentsay her ideas are realistic 56 percnt say his are the case she makes is purely tactical she can win she can pass her program she has more delegates they d be reasonable arguments if they were true but all evidence says they aren t that so many smart people buy into them only proves my point ideology makes you stupid like all ideologues neoliberals see themselves as fact driven free thinkers last fall polls started showing bernie beating republicans who beat hillary clintonites said early polls mean nothing in their best pay no attention to the man behind the curtain voices neoliberal pundits treated this baseless assertion like a law of physics it s not we take early polls with big grains of salt but clinton and trump were very well known with high hard negatives that s different six months later he still beats her in every general election poll her people still dismisses the polls she says republicans haven t attacked him yet but she sure has the result people like her less and him more she says wait till voters find out he s a socialist they did and guess what socialism got more popular if they find out how honest and frugal his brand of socialism is they ll like it even more pundits tout clinton s foreign policy cred as secretary of state she no doubt took copious notes but she s wrong on every issue she and sanders dispute she says her iraq war vote was a long time ago and anyway she apologized but her theory of the case resembles jeb bush s she blames w jeb blames the staff as secretary she applied her iraq war logic to libya and syria she promoted fracking bugged the office of the u n secretary general and meddled illegally in a honduran coup at what point is her experience cancelled out by her inability to learn from it and does bernie ever get credit for being right she has vast political experience but may be the most gaffe prone major candidate ever to run for president bernie on the other hand rarely misspeaks pundits who prize message discipline seem not to notice they used to say independent voters decide elections but independents abhor hillary and adore bernie so they say it less now hillary ranks worst of all the candidates on honesty and bernie best he has the highest favorability rating of any candidate in the race save for trump she has the lowest of any major candidate in the history of polling to fact driven free thinking neoliberals none of it matters facts that contradict ideology never do clintonites say bernie should quit so she can focus on trump but trump s no more inevitable than clinton if he gets croaked in cleveland does anyone believe she has a better shot than bernie of bringing some of his followers back into the democratic fold in any case it s not bernie but her response to him that kills her coming out against the tpp or the banks would help if she seemed at all sincere her clumsy smears bernie wants to repeal medicare bernie opposed the auto bailout bernie loves the minutemen etc etc serve only to fuel doubts about her character her shameless surrogates accuse him of partisan disloyalty could voters care less bernie won t quit but even if he did it wouldn t fix what ails her both clinton and trump argue their inevitability it s an illusion propped up by rules meant to stifle dissent superdelegates in her case winner take all in his she d be the weakest candidate democrats have nominated in half a century or more he d be the worst ever nominated by either party neither will finish strong both may crumble each will then say early wins in a rigged system entitle them to nominations will either party have the wisdom to say no current rules of both parties are undemocratic all conventions are free to adopt their own rules victory may well go to whichever one has the courage to change hillary clinton s closing argument other than her inevitability is the impossibility of the middle class getting what it wants a living wage single payer health care an end to pay to play politics one thing s for sure we ll never get them without new leader and new rules the range of possible outcomes includes a clinton trump race but also a paul ryan ted cruz or john kasich led ticket coming out of cleveland 10 points ahead of hillary clinton or 5 points behind bernie sanders it also includes a sanders trump race in which bernie beats trump by more than fdr beat alf landon it only sounds crazy if you re wearing neoliberal blinders two polls in the last five days bloomberg and cnn say that s exactly what would happen for this to happen lots of other stuff has to happen first republicans have to flinch and nominate trump bernie has to pick all the low hanging fruit that s left and win a couple of tougher races the democrats have to unstack the deck i have a suggestion start with the superdelegates for a solid year the democratic national committee has broken its own rules as hawaii rep tulsi gabbard noted in resigning as a dnc vice chair to back bernie officers may not back candidates until a nominee emerges schultz and other clintonites mock the rule in slashing debates from 26 in 2008 to six in 2016 and repealing a ban on federal contractor donations schultz a payday loan industry ally acted with zero due process no notice minutes meeting or vote dnc members said not a word 435 of them all unelected are superdelegates they had no business voting to begin with all their votes should be allotted to candidates in proportion to their performance in each state bernie sanders must stay in the race not only till the convention but till the end of whatever ballot nominates him or hillary clinton he must do so because he and not she would make the stronger candidate and the better president regardless of how the next primaries he should do it because his campaign isn t just a revolution it s a movement that must outlast this election and many more to come blinded by ideology and self interest party elites say everything we want is impossible the people in the movement know if we keep eyes on the prize we can do great things even a thing as great as electing bernie sanders president bill curry was white house counselor to president bill clinton and a two time democratic nominee for governor of connecticut copyright 2019 salon com llc
