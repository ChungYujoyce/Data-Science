donald trump is a proud man he rarely admits thathe s wrong he even said at one point in this campaign a lot of times when you apologize they use it as ammunition against you but donald trump effectively apologized twice on friday or at least admitted he was wrong twice and arguably he did itthree and even four times first on friday morning there was trump s admission that he mistook video of the release of u s hostages held by iran in geneva as video of a transfer of 400 million from the united states to iran then on friday night he endorsed house speaker paul d ryan s r wis reelection after declining to do so just threedays prior oh and he also endorsed sens john mccain r ariz and kelly ayotte r n h whom he also conspicuously declined to back earlier this week we will have disagreements but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory and very importantly toward real change trump said of ryan in green bay wis the endorsement followed plenty ofuncertainty in commentsto the washington post s philip rucker on tuesday trump declined to back ryan and said nice things about ryan sprimary opponent paul nehlen the snub was particularly notable since ryan delayed his own endorsement of trump but given that endorsement eventually arrived trump s lack of reciprocation was seen as a political faux pas or perhaps a signal to ryan that his continued criticism of trump s controversial comments wasn t appreciated trump also thumbed his nose at ayotte citing her lack of direct support you have a kelly ayotte who doesn t want to talk about trump but i m beating her in the polls by a lot trump told rucker you tell me are these people that should be representing us okay you tell me in the end though it looks like a gop nominee who often says things he might regret had cometo regret these comments trump trails in the presidential race badly in recent polls by as much as 15 points and the potential for the gop establishment to desert him was just not something he could take on ryan has set himself up as the conscience of the gop he withheld his endorsement of trump for a long time before coming around and he has regularly weighed in when the establishment saw trump going too far but what s most notable here is that ryan continued his criticism of trump even after trump threatened to withhold his endorsement we just came out our convention and yeah he shad a pretty strange run since the convention ryan told jerry bader ofwisconsin local radio station wtaqin an interview thursday you would think you ought tobe focusing on hillary clinton on all of her deficiencies she is such a weak candidate that one would think we d be on offense against hillary clinton and it is distressing that that s not what we re talking about these days ryan reassured that his support wasn t a blank check and even sent a fundraising email that could be read to warn of a potential landslide trump loss in november if trump wanted ryan to kiss the ring and back down he didn t get it but despite that he felt the pressure to back the most significant figure in the gop establishment and in doing so he also bowed to the pressure he faced to endorse two senators who would be very important to gop efforts to hold onto the senate we re past the point where things like this can be cast as trump truly changing tack and shifting into general election mode but clearly this was one case in whichhe bowed to the kind of political reality he usually shrugs at receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
