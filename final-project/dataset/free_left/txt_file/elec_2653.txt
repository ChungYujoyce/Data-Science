advertisement supported by by jonathan martin and patrick healy north charleston s c donald j trump and senator ted cruz of texas sharply attacked each other on thursday night over the canadian born mr cruz s eligibility to be president and mr trump s new york values shedding any semblance of cordiality as they dominated a republican debate less than three weeks before the iowa caucuses their exchanges showcased the intense and unpredictable new phase of the race as polls tighten and 11 candidates jockey for political advantage not only over issues like imposing tariffs on chinese goods and fighting the islamic state but also over matters of character and integrity that drew some of the hardest punches of the race so far in many ways it was the darkest debate of the campaign as the republicans tried to paint the grimmest possible portrait of an america in decline economically despite rapid job growth and militarily though they praised service members the ferocity onstage reflected the pressure in the race as it distills into a contest between the anti establishment mr trump and mr cruz followed by other candidates like senator marco rubio of florida and gov chris christie of new jersey mr rubio and mr christie along with jeb bush and john kasich are vying to emerge as the leading candidate of mainstream republicans yet they struggled to be heard on thursday night mr cruz who has gained ground against mr trump recently and is now virtually tied with him in the polls in iowa charged that mr trump was turning desperate because his standing as front runner had turned shaky after months as mr trump s closest ally in the race mr cruz pointedly noted that mr trump had dismissed questions in the fall about mr cruz s constitutional eligibility given his birth to an american mother living in calgary alberta the constitution hasn t changed but the poll numbers have mr cruz said donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in iowa mr cruz added that the law was on his side noting that senator john mccain while born in the panama canal zone was eligible to run for president by mr trump s standard mr cruz asserted mr trump himself might not be eligible to run for president because his mother was born in scotland but i was born here big difference mr trump said mr cruz gave his most aggressive performance so far as he sought to protect the support he has built among social conservatives and evangelical christians he was relentless in trying to put mr trump in his place in part to appeal to establishment republicans who are deeply uncomfortable with mr trump s candidacy transcript na the debate turned from a reality show into a comedy as mr trump mused that if he chose mr cruz as his running mate democrats would sue to challenge mr cruz s eligibility as they would he said if mr cruz won the presidential primary if you become the nominee who the hell knows if you can even serve in office mr trump said mr cruz a pugnacious polished debater as a princeton undergraduate gave no quarter i m not going to take legal advice from donald trump he said to laughter and he offered to make mr trump his running mate so he could assume the presidency if a theoretical legal challenge against mr cruz s eligibility were successful mr rubio seeing an opening to position himself above the spat eventually interjected mocking his rivals i hate to interrupt this episode of court tv he said drawing laughs and applause he then sought to refocus the conversation on president obama s shortcomings and what he said was a need to revive the country safe terrain for republican primary voters neither mr rubio who spent most of the debate delivering rehearsed lines that seemed to come out of speeches nor the other four republicans on the debate stage left nearly as big an impression during the night as mr trump and mr cruz mr cruz seemed more comfortably in command with his needling of mr trump who was booed frequently but then he was asked to elaborate on his suggestion earlier in the week that mr trump embodied new york values mr cruz stood by it saying americans outside new york city understood the reference i think most people know exactly what new york values are socially liberal pro gay marriage pro abortion focused on money and the media he said but mr trump in an uncharacteristically calm and measured answer that built to a powerful conclusion recalled the way that new yorkers suffered grieved and recovered from the sept 11 2001 attacks drawing applause even from mr cruz the people in new york fought and fought and fought and we saw more death even the smell of death no one understood it mr trump said and we rebuilt downtown manhattan and everyone in the world watched and loved new york and new yorkers and i ll tell you that was a very insulting statement that ted made other candidates yearned to cut in several attacked mr trump s recent comment to the new york times editorial board that he would favor a 45 percent tariff on chinese exports to the united states mr trump denied making the comment though he had been recorded saying that he would tax china on products coming in and that the tax should be 45 percent this would be devastating for our economy said mr bush a former governor of florida he added we need someone with a steady hand being president of the united states mr trump shot back and we don t need a weak person being president of the united states and that s what we would get with jeb mr bush who had his best debate last month when he doggedly criticized mr trump but saw little bounce in his poll numbers in new hampshire took another pass at mr trump when he urged him to reconsider his proposal for a temporary ban on muslims entering the country but mr trump refused i want security for this country o k i want security he said he denounced the shootings last month in san bernardino calif and said it was a serious problem that no one had reported suspicious activity by the muslim couple under investigation for the killings why didn t they call the police mr trump asked of the couple s neighbors and others mr cruz like other candidates repeatedly attacked president obama criticizing his omission from his state of the union address on tuesday any mention of the navy sailors who were temporarily detained by iran this week it was heartbreaking but the good news is the next commander in chief is standing on this stage mr cruz said his rivals joined in trying to keep the focus on mr obama and hillary clinton the new york times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign on tuesday night i watched story time with barack obama and it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing mr christie said adding that american alliances were in bad need of repair and that adversaries needed to understand the limits of our patience the candidates also sought to find provocative new ways to tar mrs clinton if she gets elected her first 100 days instead of setting an agenda she might be going back and forth between the white house and the courthouse mr bush said drawing applause mr rubio sought to top that she wouldn t just be a disaster he said hillary clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the united states over applause he continued someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in benghazi can never be president of the united states mr rubio also seized an opportunity to challenge mr christie s conservative credentials on a host of issues important to party activists i like chris christie but we cannot afford to have a president of the united states that supports common core he said referring to the education standards we cannot afford to have a president of the united states that supports gun control saying mr christie had also contributed to planned parenthood and backed justice sonia sotomayor s appointment to the supreme court mr rubio added all i m saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage barack obama has done to this country it cannot be someone that agrees with his agenda mr christie responded with ridicule recalling that mr rubio had repulsed an attack from mr bush at an earlier debate by suggesting that mr bush had been told to criticize him out of desperation though mr christie ridiculed senators as all talk no accountability he largely avoided responding with specific critiques of mr rubio s views though he recalled that mr rubio had once lauded him as a conservative reformer that new jersey needed according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president while mr cruz and mr rubio have turned their attention to their most immediate threats mr trump and mr christie they clashed after mr cruz claimed that the immigration overhaul mr rubio helped put together in 2013 had made it easier for mr obama to bring syrian refugees to america mr rubio accused mr cruz of shifting to the right on immigration saying mr cruz had once supported increasing legal immigration levels he also said that mr cruz had reversed himself on crop supports because it would help you in iowa that is not consistent conservatism mr rubio said that is political calculation mr cruz replied with mockery i appreciate your dumping your oppo research folder on the debate stage he said referring to the compilation of vulnerabilities campaigns keep on their rivals he said mr rubio s accusations were flat out false drawing boos from a crowd friendly to mr rubio and then invoked a cast of politicians well known to republican primary voters marco stood with chuck schumer and barack obama on amnesty he said i stood with jeff sessions and steve king two immigration hard liners in congress mr cruz faced with a question about his failure to disclose a large loan in his 2012 senate race attacked the new york times and called the lack of disclosure a paperwork error the entire new york times attack is that i disclosed that loan on one filing with the united states senate that was a public filing but it was not on a second filing with the f e c he said referring to the federal election commission both of those filings were public mr cruz s bank loan was the focus of a times article published wednesday night which reported that he and his wife had borrowed up to 1 million from goldman sachs and citibank during his 2012 senate primary race in texas mr cruz did not disclose the loans on campaign finance reports as required by law during that race he railed against wall street bailouts and the influence of big banks in washington a populist outsider message that is also central to his presidential campaign after his 2012 victory he said in interviews that he and his wife heidi had sacrificed all we had saved by putting personal funds into his senate campaign near the end of the debate the disputes took a turn toward the substantive as mr rubio unbidden targeted a business tax proposal by mr cruz calling it a value added tax mr cruz countered that mr rubio s tax plan would leave the internal revenue service in place mr rubio shot back there has to be some agency that s going to collect your vat tax after one exchange between mr cruz and mr rubio mr christie saw an opportunity i d like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the senate he said pointing out that the original question had been about entitlements mr rubio sought to retake the floor but mr christie cut him off you already had your chance marco mr christie said you blew it advertisement
