on tuesday hillary clinton s campaign revealed her plan for tackling autism that in and of itself isn t huge news clinton has tons of plans she s got a plan to cure alzheimer s disease a plan to crack down on campus sexual assault a plan to reduce out of pocket health costs and many many more but the nature of the plan is news some of the major elements of the plan include the major throughline in each element of the agenda is a desire to help autistic individuals to make schools and workplaces more accessible for and understanding of them to prevent them from being mistreated to fund housing caregiving and other services they need politicians efforts on autism have historically focused on researching the condition s causes and ways to prevent it it seems obvious that a presidential campaign s autism plan should focus on helping autistic people but for years it hasn t been obvious that the democratic frontrunner s plan is about helping autistic people rather than curing them or eliminating their condition is actually quite a radical shift it s helpful to contrast clinton s agenda with that of the combating autism act which george w bush signed into law in 2006 the first problem with the act was its name which implied that the goal of public policy should be to stamp out autism rather than helping autists this is troublesome both because it does nothing for autistic people alive today and because many on the autism spectrum myself included don t view autism as wholly negative and argue that society could benefit from acknowledging and celebrating neurodiversity we don t want autism to be combated we want autistic people to be supported that means government policy that provides services that enable people on every point in the autism spectrum to learn work and find acceptance in their communities but the law was also troubling because of how some 945 million in federal spending authorized by the act was allocated a 2013 report from the government accountability office found that of 1 206 autism research projects funded by the federal government from 2008 to 2012 after the combating autism act was passed a little under half focused on either the biology behind autism or on the condition s causes by contrast only 21 percent researched treatment and interventions what s more an analysis by the autism self advocacy network found that only about 1 5 percent of the national institutes of health s spending on autism research goes to the needs of autistic adults and only 2 4 percent goes to improving services hillary clinton was very much on board with this approach and language and in the 2008 election cycle spoke of the need to face the rising tide of autism and bragged about co sponsoring the combating autism act there s nothing wrong with learning more about the biology of autism and there s nothing wrong with trying to figure out how to treat or reverse its more debilitating effects life self harm and co morbid conditions autists are at elevated risk of epilepsy for example but many autism advocates have argued that this funding would be better spent researching how to help autistic people alive now that could bring more immediate tangible benefits to people on the autism spectrum clinton s new proposal is a step toward doing that she focuses almost exclusively on improving treatment of and services for autistic people she highlights autistic adults who have traditionally been neglected in public policy discussions around autism while she calls for an increase in research funding she emphasizes that it must fund a range of autism related research including studies that improve the quality of patient services for people with autism not just biological research she also makes a point of calling on the centers for disease control and prevention to accurately measure the incidence of autism among adults something that the uk has done but the us thus far has not in talking about treatment the plan specifically mentions behavioral and developmental interventions the including of developmental is meant to indicate that clinton doesn t only want to cover applied behavioral analysis a treatment that s highly controversial among autistic people it suggests clinton wants to support less divisive evidence based behavioral interventions like the play project model as well as developmental support through things like occupational and speech therapy the construction and rollout of the plan is also illustrative the announcement of the plan included a conference call in which ari ne eman head of the autistic self advocacy network a leading autism rights group participated and asan was also consulted as the package was being put together this is a sign of how far the world of autism politics has come in the last ten years ne eman writes in an email in 2006 congress was passing a combating autism act focusing exclusively on causation and cure related research ten years later one of the leading candidates for president has put forward an agenda that includes a heavy focus on services and adults that s significant have we gotten everything that we wanted of course not is this
