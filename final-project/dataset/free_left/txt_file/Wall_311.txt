advertisement supported by for once vladimir putin followed in the path of his american counterpart president trump and with similar results a greater risk of catastrophe that might have been avoided by maxim trudolyubov mr trudolyubov a contributing writer edits the russia file a blog published by the kennan institute in washington vilnius lithuania i was stuck at home for too long had to go for a ride a friend from moscow shouted into his phone several weeks ago trying to outyell the noise around him on a trip it turned out to st petersburg we re going to hit a bar here and get some drinks will call he then disappeared from the video chat in which i could see people behind him walking along a familiar st petersburg street i get very different dispatches from friends who live in a small town in italy there they stay home and tell me about relentless police raids against wanderers in the streets a friend in berlin says it is ok to go out but not to gather in groups of more than two the coronavirus pandemic caught me in vilnius lithuania a city where the streets are deserted the bars are dead and all flights have stopped never in my wildest dreams did i imagine seeing in a european democracy a police enforced order that limits personal freedoms contrasted by scenes of boisterous social merriment in moscow my normally order obsessed and state controlled hometown as i write this russia is catching up still the inversion between east and west of attitudes toward individual freedoms during the covid 19 disaster is startling there is certainly no shortage of police in moscow but the kremlin has been late in introducing consistent quarantine measures because it is undecided it evokes the confusion now engulfing the united states where president trump s late and muddled start has contributed to disaster president vladimir putin did no planning for a coronavirus coming in from abroad now it has interfered with his politics which in his view should always take precedence over everything else as a result his country will face a far more destructive outcome than might have been avoided had he started earlier on march 28 russians were shown pictures of mr putin wearing a bright yellow hazmat suit and a breathing mask he visited a hospital housing covid 19 patients and inspected a construction site for an emergency hospital near moscow mr putin was transitioning from an it s a foreign threat stage to accepting the reality of an infectious threat to the population but like president trump mr putin seems uncomfortable with recognizing the virus s biological nonpolitical nature a chinese virus they call it as if that explains its ferocity the default mode of laying blame in which both leaders politics and popularity are paramount is apparently hard to reconcile with a reality that can t be manipulated in times of natural calamities hard truths suddenly take command and if you live in a world where everything and everyone is either for you or against you the whole virus thing sounds politically suspicious that is why for the past several weeks some of russia s state run media and security agencies have been preoccupied with silencing those who spread panic among the population and russia s tabloid style press has been filled with conspiracy theories that the virus is a biological weapon or a hoax much of that has been translated abroad through russia s influence media an internal european union report said recently the kremlin has seemed confused on march 25 in a surprise address to the nation president putin postponed indefinitely an april 22 vote about constitutional amendments that include allowing him to run for president again in 2024 he had already signed the changes into law making the vote meaningless he then declared last week a nationwide paid holiday but his spokesman dmitry peskov later said it was not meant to be a holiday for people working remotely on thursday mr putin extended the holiday until the end of april effectively placing the burden of supporting a failing economy squarely on the shoulders of businesses and other employers the paid holiday move puzzles many with time it became clear that announcing a holiday was a typical putin ruse deployed to prevent him from being associated with negative decisions he refuses to use words like emergency restrictions or quarantines in response moscow s mayor sergey sobyanin has taken the lead in quarantine policymaking he has issued additional regional restrictions on businesses and movements around town he has imposed a self isolation regime and is seeking an app that would allow the mayor s office to police the compliance now with no coherent nationwide policy announced other regional and municipal authorities have been making their own decisions which is unusual considering russia s normally hypercentralized decision making process after mr putin s address to the nation the number of covid 19 cases started to grow on sunday russia confirmed more than 670 new coronavirus infections in a day bringing the official total to almost 5 400 but most people in russia are unsure what to believe 24 percent of those polled by the nongovernmental levada center say they distrust official information on the pandemic 35 percent say they trust it only in part that leaves many russians thinking the authorities have been whitewashing the threat by preventing doctors from diagnosing covid 19 indeed in january russia registered a spike in pneumonia of 37 percent more cases than a year ago according to russia s statistical agency many think that most of the pneumonias could in fact have been covid 19 cases in a country of 144 million people with a long border with china and until recently busy connections with italy the official tally seems incredibly low the true scale of the virus spread in russia is unknowable for all those reasons and more russia s tests for the coronavirus are much less sensitive than those used in other countries as of march 21 russia had carried out 133 100 tests with 306 returning positive at 0 21 percent the ratio of tests to positive cases is startlingly low when compared with most other countries results amid the current confusion a grim alternative explanation for russia s lax response has been circulating that it is a deliberate policy of letting the virus spread to as many people as possible in expectation that they will become immune to the new pathogen assuming they live that s a rumor of course too gruesome to discuss publicly because of the obvious human cost such a policy would risk so what can russia do china and germany provide opposing alternatives china s leaders after hesitation unleashed the full power of an authoritarian state against the outbreak it worked but the aggressive quarantine efforts and extensive use of human tracking technologies will attract criticism for a long time germany chose political openness early on chancellor angela merkel laid out facts and statistics charting germany s likeliest prospects the consensus among experts she said is that 60 to 70 percent of the population will be infected as long as this remains the situation so far germany s response has been relatively successful with a covid 19 fatality rate far lower than in many other countries the kremlin s reaction has been much less aggressive than in china and much less open than in most european countries it may be falling behind the disease s progress because of mr putin s political goals or it may be purposefully letting the virus run its course in both cases we are dealing with a political experiment with human subjects with the consequences unknown maxim trudolyubov is an editor at large for the business magazine vedomosti in
