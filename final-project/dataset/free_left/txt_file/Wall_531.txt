advertisement supported by the evolving story of this drug represents one failure after another among government officials physicians and the media by haider warraich dr warraich is a cardiologist and researcher at brigham and women s hospital and harvard medical school president trump revealed on monday that despite warnings from the food and drug administration he said he has been taking hydroxychloroquine for about a week and a half as a preventive measure the f d a warnings about hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine follow studies of the drug that have so far largely proved disappointing while not definitive large studies have showed no benefit for covid 19 though some indicated an elevated risk of serious adverse effects like cardiac arrest the president is not alone in taking this risky drug in an analysis in this paper for example prescriptions surged to almost 32 000 on the night of march 19 when president trump supported the drug during a news conference representing more than 46 times the rate of the average weekday for the drug the evolving story of hydroxychloroquine represents one failure after another involving political leaders media talking heads like laura ingraham and sean hannity physicians researchers and regulators the bottom line is that even as we are in the midst of a pandemic with a climbing death toll hydroxychloroquine has potentially added to the body count because of its serious possible side effects like liver and kidney damage heart failure and cardiac arrest and by creating a shortage of the drug for patients with lupus whose disease flares when they don t take hydroxychloroquine reforms we enact now can optimize our response to the next phase of this evolving pandemic as well as to future emergencies to fix this process we should take four steps first we need to ensure that the f d a retains patient safety as its top priority on march 28 in an unprecedented move based on little clinical rationale the f d a issued an emergency use authorization for the use of the drugs for patients with covid 19 even as the same institution subsequently warned about its risks while the f d a has a long history of protecting the american public from harm this decision was highly unusual and has been criticized roundly rick bright the removed chief of the biomedical advanced research and development agency said in a whistle blower statement that he was ousted in part for resisting potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections there is a critical need to make the emergency use authorization process more transparent and to maintain the independence of regulators second pharmacists can offer an additional layer of protection from potentially dangerous prescriptions in an analysis using national anonymous pharmacy data that my team of physician researchers performed with goodrx we found that while prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine rose by 99 percent over the usual rate in independent pharmacies in the week of march 15 chain pharmacies saw a giant spike of 285 percent confirming reports of chain pharmacies being engulfed in chaos during the pandemic independent pharmacies may have seen an attenuated surge in hydroxychloroquine prescription compared with chains because pharmacists there usually have more time which allows them to provide more counseling to individuals picking up prescriptions reducing pharmacists workload and providing them more time and more of a say in the prescriptions they dispense can be helpful in reducing the filling of inappropriate or unsafe prescriptions third no amount of reforms will be successful if they don t address those signing the prescriptions physicians are on the front lines of this ravaging pandemic and have seen the destruction this disease can cause many are rightfully fearful not just for their patients but also for their own well being in fact some physicians stockpiled hydroxychloroquine for themselves or their loved ones yet it has never been more important to be guided by evidence rather than emotion physicians should be required to document the diagnosis they are writing a prescription for before it can be filled as many states now require many physicians felt they had to react quickly in a data free zone to the information available as they faced off a harrowing disease yet their widespread prescribing of hydroxychloroquine may have had a paradoxical effect by potentially diverting patients from continuing clinical trials instead of providing more insights it has greatly diminished what we know about the effects of the drug on covid 19 a pandemic is in fact the best time to enroll patients in trials since the pool of potential subjects is enormous and treatment standards have not been established for rapid generation of knowledge bureaucratic hurdles to enrollment in clinical trials need to be significantly eased so that novel interventions can be swiftly assessed if even a small fraction of the patients prescribed hydroxychloroquine had enrolled in trials instead we would already have definitive evidence of any potential benefit of this drug as others including the american medical association have warned given the potentially dangerous side effects and no proof of defense against covid 19 taking the drug to prevent the disease as president trump is reportedly doing may not be a wise decision in my view given what we know today americans should stay away from this drug until definitive trials are published the hydroxychloroquine fiasco is not the first time a public health crisis has been created by rampant distribution of prescription drugs let s not forget that we are still in the midst of an opioid epidemic that was largely ignited by similar factors loosely regulated drugs with limited evidence that were overprescribed by doctors with little pharmacist oversight pandemonium often follows a pandemic while we were clearly unprepared for this first wave let s not repeat these missteps in the future physicians pharmacists and regulators are working to protect patients from the pathogen but they also need to protect them from themselves haider warraich haiderwarraich the author of state of the heart exploring the history science and future of cardiac disease is a cardiologist and
