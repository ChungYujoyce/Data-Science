the democratic frontrunner won decisively to take a stranglehold on the race despite all of sanders s rallies and celebrity endorsements washington bureau chief hillary clinton claimed that she was finally in the homestretch of the democratic nomination battle tuesday night after halting bernie sanders s comeback with a decisive victory in the new york primary sanders spent the week sowing the seeds of doubt within clinton s coalition blistering her for her association with wall street holding a series of mega rallies collecting a host of celebrity endorsements and out spending her by 2 1 on tv ads he needed a win or a very close finish to maintain the momentum in his unlikely bid to upset clinton but the brooklyn native was defeated by more than 15 points victory is in sight declared clinton at a new york rally staffers near the back of the room hugged each other visibly relieved that this particularly ugly part of the primary campaign had concluded the democratic race had taken a turn for the combative in new york a family feud that played out in prime time last week during the debate in brooklyn at about a quarter to 10 another one bites the dust blasted through the sheraton ballroom at the same moment clinton tweeted her thanks to new york for electing her statewide yet again with 98 percent of the precincts declared she was leading 57 9 percent to 42 1 percent you proved once again there s no place like home she said this one is personal she claimed the race was all but over and that a certain wild haired socialist might start thinking about packing it in clinton even tried to knock the assumption that the sanders campaign had a monopoly on excitement tonight i want to say to all of my supporters and all of the voters you have carried us every step of the way with passion and conviction that some critics have tried to dismiss she said a campaign version of a we ve got spirit taunt after days of massive confidence boosting rallies most sanders supporters were were likely in no mood to listen but clinton also tried to reach out i believe there is much more that unites us than divides us she said judging by sanders s fundraising email blast as the results came in the vermont senator is not about to give up and unite behind the frontrunner sisters and brothers it began we didn t get the victory we had hoped for this evening but what s important is that it looks like we re going to win a lot more delegates in new york than any state that voted or caucused before tonight he then suggested a donation of 2 70 to keep the bern going despite the sanders insurgency hillary clinton has looked every inch the democratic nominee for years across town tuesday night donald trump walked through the lobby of trump tower looking more like a potential nominee than a celebrity for the first time he entered to frank sinatra s new york new york bathed in the red and blue lights that have decorated each of his victory speeches to date he shook hands and hugged bystanders before taking to the lectern surrounded by his family and friends like carl paladino the failed gubernatorial candidate ten months ago on june 16 trump was in this very room in what he now believes to be an iconic scene he came down the escalator with his wife melania and into a sea of reporters and paid extras pretending to be fervent fans back then he seemed like a sideshow and beltway analysts and pundits predicted he would fizzle out quickly this time the escalator was frozen his fans stood on it and peered down at him as he spoke he had just won his 20th contest with more than 60 percent of the vote and added to his substantial delegate lead on his way to the 1 237 needed to secure the republican nomination the event was billed as a press conference by trump s campaign but he didn t take any questions instead giving a condensed version of his stump speech that focused primarily on jobs he promised not just to make america great again but to make it really legitimately so great but as always politics not policy specifics preoccupied the candidate we re gonna end at a very high level and get a lot more delegates than anybody projected in their wildest imaginations he said this has been an incredible evening it s been an incredible day and week he said it has really been something amazing like clinton he suggested it was time for primary season to come to an end we don t have much of a race anymore based on what i m seeing on television he added sen cruz is just about mathematically eliminated and we ve won another state ted cruz was beaten into third place in the new york primary with just 14 5 percent of the vote while ohio gov john kasich was at 25 1 percent with 98 percent of precincts counted we expect we re going to have an amazing number of weeks he said we re going to go into the convention i think as a winner and nobody can take an election away the way they re doing it in the republican party he said
