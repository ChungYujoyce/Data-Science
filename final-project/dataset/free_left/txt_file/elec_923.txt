advertisement supported by by scott shane and sheera frenkel the russian influence campaign on social media in the 2016 election made an extraordinary effort to target african americans used an array of tactics to try to suppress turnout among democratic voters and unleashed a blizzard of activity on instagram that rivaled or exceeded its posts on facebook according to a report produced for the senate intelligence committee the report adds new details to the portrait that has emerged over the last two years of the energy and imagination of the russian effort to sway american opinion and divide the country which the authors said continues to this day active and ongoing interference operations remain on several platforms says the report produced by new knowledge a cybersecurity company based in austin tex along with researchers at columbia university and canfield research llc one continuing russian campaign for instance seeks to influence opinion on syria by promoting bashar al assad the syrian president and a russian ally in the brutal conflict there the new knowledge report is one of two commissioned by the senate committee on a bipartisan basis they are based largely on data about the russian operations provided to the senate by facebook twitter and the other companies whose platforms were used read the new knowledge report here the second report was written by the computational propaganda project at oxford university along with graphika a company that specializes in analyzing social media the washington post first reported on the oxford report on sunday read the oxford report here the russian influence campaign in 2016 was run by a st petersburg company called the internet research agency owned by a businessman yevgeny v prigozhin who is a close ally of president vladimir v putin of russia mr prigozhin and a dozen of the company s employees were indicted last february as part of the investigation of russian interference by robert s mueller iii the special counsel both reports stress that the internet research agency created social media accounts under fake names on virtually every available platform a major goal was to support donald j trump first against his republican rivals in the presidential race then in the general election and as president since his inauguration among the services the russians have provided mr trump is to join in and amplify his regular attacks on mr mueller posing as fed up americans the internet research agency trolls have denounced the investigation of russian election interference as a weird conspiracy pushed only by liberal crybabies the new knowledge report says one facebook page called merican fury declared falsely that mr mueller worked with radical islamic groups another back the badge called james b comey the f b i director fired by mr trump a dirty cop creating accounts designed to pass as belonging to americans the internet research agency spread its messages not only via facebook instagram and twitter which have drawn the most attention but also on youtube reddit tumblr pinterest vine and google among other platforms its attack on the united states used almost exclusively high tech tools created by american companies the new knowledge researchers discovered many examples of the russian operators building an audience with one theme and then shifting to another often more provocative set of messages for instance an instagram account called army of jesus first posted in january 2015 images from the muppet show then shifted to the simpsons and by early 2016 became jesus focused multiple memes associated jesus with mr trump s campaign and satan with that of his rival hillary clinton see the russians most popular posts and memes the russian campaign was the subject of senate hearings last year and has been widely scrutinized by academic experts the new reports largely confirm earlier findings that the campaign was designed to attack mrs clinton boost mr trump and exacerbate existing divisions in american society but the new knowledge report gives particular attention to the russians focus on african americans which is evident to anyone who examines collections of their memes and messages the most prolific i r a efforts on facebook and instagram specifically targeted black american communities and appear to have been focused on developing black audiences and recruiting black americans as assets the report says using gmail accounts with american sounding names the russians recruited and sometimes paid unwitting american activists of all races to stage rallies and spread content but there was a disproportionate pursuit of african americans it concludes the report says that while other distinct ethnic and religious groups were the focus of one or two facebook pages or instagram accounts the black community was targeted extensively with dozens in some cases facebook ads were targeted at users who had shown interest in particular topics including black history the black panther party and malcolm x the most popular of the russian instagram accounts was blackstagram with 303 663 followers the internet research agency also created a dozen websites disguised as african american in origin with names like blackmattersus com blacktivist info blacktolive org and blacksoul us on youtube the largest share of russian material covered the black lives matter movement and police brutality with channels called don t shoot and blacktolive the report does not seek to explain the heavy focus on african americans but the internet research agency s tactics echo soviet propaganda efforts from decades ago that often highlighted racism and racial conflict in the united states as well as recent russian influence operations in other countries that sought to stir ethnic strife renee diresta one of the report s authors and director of research at new knowledge said the internet research agency leveraged pre existing legitimate grievances wherever they could as the election effort geared up the black lives matter movement was at the center of national attention in the united states so the russian operation took advantage of it she said and added blue lives matter material when a pro police pushback emerged very real racial tensions and feelings of alienation exist in america and have for decades ms diresta said the i r a didn t create them it exploits them roger j stone jr one of six trump advisers convicted in cases stemming from the investigation by the special counsel was sentenced to more than three years in prison of 81 facebook pages created by the internet research agency in the senate s data 30 targeted african american audiences amassing 1 2 million followers the report finds by comparison 25 pages targeted the political right and drew 1 4 million followers just seven pages focused on the political left drawing 689 045 followers in response the n a a c p said it would not use facebook or instagram for a week and urged its social media followers and partners to do the same while the right wing pages promoted mr trump s candidacy the left wing pages scorned mrs clinton while promoting senator bernie sanders of vermont and jill stein the green party candidate the voter suppression effort was focused particularly on sanders supporters and african americans urging them to shun mrs clinton in the general election and either vote for ms stein or stay home whether such efforts had a significant effect is difficult to judge black voter turnout declined in 2016 for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election but it is impossible to determine whether that was the result of the russian campaign the new knowledge report argues that the internet research agency s presence on instagram has been underestimated and may have been as effective or more effective than its facebook effort the report says there were 187 million engagements on instagram users liking or sharing the content created in russia compared with 76 5 million engagements on facebook in 2017 as the american news media focused on the russian operations on facebook and twitter the russian effort shifted strongly to instagram the report says the new knowledge report criticizes social media companies for misleading the public regrettably it appears that the platforms may have misrepresented or evaded in some of their statements to congress the report says noting what it calls one false claim that specific population groups were not targeted by the influence operation and another that the campaign did not seek to discourage voting it is unclear whether these answers were the result of faulty or lacking analysis or a more deliberate evasion the report says the report suggests a grudging respect for the scale and creativity of russian influence operations but the russians were not eager to take credit for their own efforts after the election the report says the internet research agency put up some 70 posts on facebook and instagram that mocked the claims that russia had interfered in the election you ve lost and don t know what to do said one such post just blame it on russian hackers
