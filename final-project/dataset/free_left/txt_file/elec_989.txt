 former vice president joe biden has been viewed with suspicion at times by immigration reform advocates for his lack of outreach to latino communities in the past charlie neibergall ap photo 2020 elections biden echoed a conservative talking point in the last democratic debate saying undocumented immigrants need to get in line by marc caputo and natasha korecki 08 14 2019 05 21 am edt joe biden s presidential campaign is quietly playing cleanup with dozens of immigration activists and latino leaders weeks after upsetting them by using what they considered loaded language to describe his views on immigration policy biden said at the july 31 democratic debate that undocumented immigrants need to get in line and that the country has been right to cherry pick high skilled immigrants notably those with advanced degrees advertisement that language more commonly used by conservatives triggered widespread criticism from immigrant rights activists some of whom said the former vice president was echoing republican talking points on how migrants are admitted to the united states the campaign quickly embarked on damage control aides assuaged aggrieved activists and biden had a closed door meeting with latino leaders in san diego before his speech at the unidosus conference last week it is unacceptable for a candidate vying to be the democratic nominee for potus to use language like that used by vp biden when talking about immigration during the second debate said mayra mac as executive director of latino victory we immediately reached out to the campaign and were told it was being addressed activists view the get in line language as a dodge invoked by immigration hard liners they argue that it s used to obscure that there really is no practical line for many hopeful migrants from latin america to stand in if they don t have an employer or family member sponsoring their immigration and biden s line about advanced degrees they say deemphasizes family reunification and has a racial component as well when biden uttered the words get in line mac as said my phone started blowing up with messages and calls from other activists about his rhetoric former vice president joe biden speaks while sens kamala harris cory booker listen during the democratic debate on july 31 in detroit biden said that people should have to get in line that s the problem scott olson getty images on the receiving end of most of the calls and messages to the campaign more than 100 was biden s senior adviser crist bal alex a well respected operative in the immigrant rights community for his previous work at latino victory alex quickly began clarifying biden s remarks immediately after he briefed biden about the nuances of the policy and pushed for the roundtable with latino leaders in san diego though he acknowledged some people were upset or confused by biden s comments alex downplayed the extent of the controversy pointing out that biden has long been well respected by latino leaders and that he has impressed members of the congressional hispanic caucus i wouldn t say we re putting out fires or dealing with fallout we are taking in a lot of comments and suggestions from the community alex said it s hard to convey his true grasp of this issue and it s hard to convey how much he cares about immigrants in the community in a 15 second retort to someone attacking him he added biden s campaign says he supports comprehensive changes to the immigration system that would increase immigration levels provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who haven t committed crimes and are employed and legalize the status of immigrants brought to the country illegally as children known as dreamers biden has been viewed with suspicion at times by immigration activists they point to what they call his lack of outreach to latino communities in the past and his time as vice president under barack obama who was tagged by liberal leaning activists as the deporter in chief because of his administration s border enforcement policies activists interrupted biden s remarks during last month s debate in detroit and in early july six demonstrators were arrested during a sit in at biden s philadelphia campaign headquarters the tension between biden s campaign and the activist community has roots in his overall campaign strategy he s running as a centrist in a primary in which most of the other top tier candidates are tilting left and many liberal activists aren t enthused about an old white moderate leading the ticket we re only going to go as far left as we have to one top latino supporter of biden s said we re looking at november 2020 but we know we have to deal with the primary so it s a tightrope for sure 2020 dems on the issues immigration daca illegal entry the wall the criticism of biden s immigration policies of course comes as president donald trump is stretching the outer limits of u s policy and presidential rhetoric on immigrants since taking office trump s policies have spanned from separating families at the u s mexico border to imposing a ban on travel from several muslim majority countries to denying green cards to immigrants who have accessed welfare programs biden s camp argues his approach is not only an antidote to trump s extreme policies but one that doesn t move too far left and is therefore in line with the majority of primary and general election voters it also thinks trump s far right policies and racist rhetoric will drive latinos to the polls one top biden surrogate former labor secretary and current los angeles county supervisor hilda solis said his get in line remark was just a poor choice of words i think he has to rephrase and pivot solis said i know the man is compassionate and more importantly he has a record she added that hispanic voters care most about health care and greatly benefit from obamacare which biden has pledged to protect and improve the importance of the hispanic vote will come to bear feb 22 when nevada where about 15 percent of the democratic voters are hispanic holds the third nominating contest in the nation ten days later california and texas voters will cast ballots on super tuesday after which 70 percent of the latino vote will have weighed in hispanic voters also will be crucial in swing states florida and nevada in november jose parra who once advised former senate majority leader harry reid on latino issues said he wondered how biden could have made the get in line comment if he truly had been involved in the bipartisan immigration reform effort in 2013 parra also noted that biden during the debate refused to discuss where he differed with obama on deportations many just don t understand why he was onstage spewing republican talking points parra said biden was on defense throughout the debate on immigration he drew the most fire from the only latino onstage juli n castro who called for decriminalizing border crossings biden disagreed saying immigrants have to wait in line moments later biden said when people cross the border illegally it is illegal to do it unless they re seeking asylum people should have to get in line that s the problem and the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of donald trump we should defeat donald trump and end this practice people with doctorates should get a green card for seven years biden also said we should keep them here cory booker criticized him for that it really irks me because i heard the vice president say that if you got a ph d you can come right into this country the new jersey senator said well that s playing into what the republicans want to pit some immigrants against other immigrants in iowa last week biden cited the 2008 economic meltdown as an explanation for obama era deportations saying the administration was consumed by keeping the country from going over the cliff financially and didn t turn to deportations until after that crisis we were losing 800 000 jobs a month when we started biden said by the time we were able to get things moving and focused on this we did not send anybody back who had in fact not committed a felony joe biden s resume is unmatched but his past positions make him a target on the left see where he stands on all the issues speaking at length before the asian and latino coalition in des moines iowa biden said he would give dreamers legal status and promised to end trump s zero tolerance policy that led to widespread family separation at the border if you re coming here and you re making the case you should be able to come to the country and have your case adjudicated so i would flood the zone with officers who can make the initial determination of whether or not you qualify immediately he said and you don t have to lock a single person up there is no rationale whatsoever to separate families zero rationale biden added to applause we did not do that asked earlier in the day while at the iowa state fair if he thought he adequately addressed deportations under obama biden told politico yes i do for angelica salas executive director for the coalition for humane immigrant rights biden s effort to explain his debate comment was welcome at the san diego meeting with the candidate she spoke her mind and said she appreciated that he listened when she discussed the fallacy of immigration lines for mexican and central american migrants the big problem is the belief that the system is working for people of color it is not salas said people talk about how this is a broken system and that s not the case it is designed to be like this and the idea of oh just get in line like everyone else is just a falsehood astrid silva a nevada immigration activist and dreamer who arranged a private meeting in may with biden and undocumented immigrants said there was a disconnect between the biden she has engaged with and the one she saw at the debate the way the vice president has come across in the meetings we have had isn t necessarily coming across on the stage silva said can i say i liked his answer onstage no i didn t appreciate it but i ve had the opportunity to speak to him and watch him with these families and the way he spoke to them missing out on the latest scoops sign up for
