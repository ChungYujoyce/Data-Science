hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities now he has 1 000 more masks on order but he s not sure what to do with them he said amazon had been vague about what constituted price gouging scaring away sellers who don t want to risk losing their ability to sell on its site to regulators and many others the sellers are sitting on a stockpile of medical supplies during a pandemic the attorney general s offices in california washington and new york are all investigating price gouging related to the coronavirus california s price gouging law bars sellers from increasing prices by more than 10 percent after officials declare an emergency new york s law prohibits sellers from charging an unconscionably excessive price during emergencies an official at the washington attorney general s office said the agency believed it could apply the state s consumer protection law to sue platforms or sellers even if they aren t in washington as long as they were trying to sell to washington residents tennessee where mr colvin lives has a price gouging law that bars people from charging unreasonable prices for essential goods and services including gasoline in direct response to a disaster according to a state website on saturday after the the times published this article the tennessee attorney general s office said it had sent investigators to mr colvin s home given him a cease and desist letter and was now investigating his case mr colvin does not believe he was price gouging while he charged 20 on amazon for two bottles of purell that retail for 1 each he said people forget that his price includes his labor amazon s fees and about 10 in shipping alcohol based sanitizer is pricey to ship because officials consider it a hazardous material current price gouging laws are not built for today s day and age mr colvin said they re built for billy bob s gas station doubling the amount he charges for gas during a hurricane he added just because it cost me 2 in the store doesn t mean it s not going to cost me 16 to get it to your door but what about the morality of hoarding products that can prevent the spread of the virus just to turn a profit mr colvin said he was simply fixing inefficiencies in the marketplace some areas of the country need these products more than others and he s helping send the supply toward the demand there s a crushing overwhelming demand in certain cities right now he said the dollar general in the middle of nowhere outside of lexington ky doesn t have that he thought about it more i honestly feel like it s a public service he added i m being paid for my public service as for his stockpile mr colvin said he would now probably try to sell it locally if ican make a slight profit that s fine he said but i mnot looking to be in a situation where imake the front page of the news for being that guy who hoarded 20 000 bottles of sanitizer that i m selling for 20 times what they cost me after the times published this article on saturday morning mr colvin said he was exploring ways to donate all the supplies advertisement
