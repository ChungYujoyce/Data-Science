advertisement supported by by jonathan martin westhampton beach n y when jeb bush stopped by the hampton synagogue here on saturday he was expected to offer a critique of the iran deal and a short version of his stump speech to the orthodox congregation but something else was on his mind the insults hurled at him by donald j trump i ll just give you a little taste of the low energy candidate s life this week mr bush said referring to the stinging taunt mr trump has repeatedly used to describe him mr bush then spent a minute and a half reeling off the cities he had visited since monday among them mcallen tex salt lake city denver pensacola fla birmingham ala greensboro n c and noted that earlier in the week he had risen at 6 a m to go running with former members of the navy seals near the virginia coast the low energy candidate this week has only been six days 16 hours a day campaigning with joy in my heart he said but mr bush does not seem to be radiating much joy these days he said last year that he would run for president only if he could do so with a sunny spirit but mr trump the surprise leader in the polls has turned this summer into a miserable one for mr bush gleefully ignoring the traditional rules of political engagement there is the personal ridicule continually questioning mr bush s vigor invoking a since retracted statement by his mother barbara bush that we ve had enough bushes in the white house and on wednesday suggesting that mr bush should stop speaking spanish but the torment goes deeper than that emphasizing bluster over ideas mr trump has turned the campaign into a tabloid style clash of personalities heavy on provocation and insults what little policy that has been discussed mostly revolves around mr trump s appeals to anxious white conservatives stoking fears about immigrants gang members and foreign countries that in his telling are eclipsing the united states it is a race in other words that embodies what mr bush likes least about politics mr bush is at his most animated discussing policy and the only thing he may be more passionate about than issues is his conviction that the republicans must become an inclusive big hearted party that appeals to people s hopes rather than their resentments history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling it s got to be difficult said john mckager stipanovich a veteran florida lobbyist who has known mr bush for more than 30 years donald trump epitomizes everything that jeb has spent his political career trying to prevent the republican party from becoming mr bush and his aides insist that they are not bothered by mr trump and how he has upended the race but moments of irritation keep spilling out in public just to state the obvious can t wait for this summer reality tv show to be over mr bush s son jeb jr said on twitter on tuesday alongside a link to a new video his father released attacking mr trump that same day his father after a campaign event in miami seemed irked when reporters asked him about mr trump he attacks me every day with nonsense with things that aren t true mr bush said in spanish before saying much the same in english he tries to personalize everything if you are not totally in agreement with him you re an idiot or stupid or you have no energy or blah blah blah that s what he does when a reporter proposed asking a non trump question if you don t mind mr bush replied i d love it more than annoyance is at stake mr bush s advisers say they believe that the relentless mockery by mr trump is contributing to their candidate s slide in the polls in a new des moines register bloomberg politics poll more iowa republicans view mr bush unfavorably than favorably mr bush has also slipped in some national surveys falling into single digits and well back in the republican pack the campaign does not want donors and up for grab republican voters to see mr bush as meekly absorbing mr trump s blows so mr bush a former florida governor has begun to criticize mr trump aggressively on the campaign trail this week he released a video highlighting the developer s previous liberal views still seemingly powerless to pull mr trump down mr bush and his advisers are expressing anger over what they see as the news media s enabling of mr trump by not scrutinizing his far fetched plans such as making mexico pay for a wall along the united states southern border look this guy s the front runner mr bush said last week at a town hall style meeting in norfolk va he should be treated like a front runner not like some kind of alternative universe to the political system at a private fund raiser the night before in richmond va mr bush was even more direct when asked by a contributor what he would do about mr trump mr bush said with a touch of wonder that mr trump s rise reminded him of reality tv adding that he was the only candidate taking him on and that he hoped the news media would begin aggressively vetting mr trump according to an attendee who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about a private event mr bush s aides have recently asked reporters why they will not say outright that mr trump s ideas on to name two issues mass deportations and trade tariffs are fantasy our country faces serious challenges we need a serious candidate who has real solutions said sally bradshaw mr bush s strategist and closest adviser mr bush s backers note that the campaign has yet to broadcast any tv ads and that their candidate s standing in the polls is likely to look different after they highlight mr bush s conservative record as florida governor on the air as mr bush himself said tuesday the election is not tomorrow of course mr trump s strength could ultimately be a political gift to mr bush if the real estate mogul remains atop the polls heading into next year and denies attention to other hard line candidates republicans could flock to support mr bush the safe well credentialed and well funded son and brother of presidents to stop mr trump but any long term optimism is tempered by recognition that the race has become a grind and that mr trump has for now made the campaign about himself his appeal and how far he can go he has faith over time in the people and the power of his ideas said mike murphy mr bush s longtime adviser and the head of his super pac but he has to exist for a while in a world where every news clip is horse race reporting on saturday after remaining with the congregation for a singing of the hymn adon olam set to the tune of god bless america mr bush walked out of the synagogue toward his waiting sport utility vehicle he was asked by a reporter if he was frustrated with mr trump mr bush shot back i don t think i mentioned his name but he did not leave it there after climbing into the passenger seat and closing the door mr bush lowered the window and as the vehicle edged out of the parking lot three more times demanded did i mention his name advertisement
