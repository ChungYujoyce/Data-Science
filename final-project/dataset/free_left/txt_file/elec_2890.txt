not qualified to be president bernie sanders told a crowd of supporters packed into temple university s arena delivering his fiercest jab yet to the struggling democratic front runner advertisement now the other day i think secretary clinton appeared to be getting a little bit nervous he began we have won we have won seven out of eight of the recent primaries and caucuses and she has been saying lately that she thinks that i am quote unquote not qualified to be president well let me let me just say in response to secretary clinton i don t believe that she is qualified if she is if she is through her super pac taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds he said i don t think you are qualified if you get 15 million from wall street through your super pac sanders pivoted to her record on foreign policy saying i don t think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in iraq i don t think you are qualified if you ve supported virtually every disastrous trade agreement which has cost us millions of decent paying jobs i don t think you are qualified if you supported the panama free trade agreement something i very strongly opposed and which as all of you know has allowed corporations and wealthy people all over the world to avoid paying their taxes to their countries clinton s camp fired back almost immediately with great umbrage taken as the sanders operation shot out new fundraising appeals keying off the senator s comments her campaign spokesman brian fallon denied that she had said the vermont senator wasn t qualified to be president

extraordinary claim she s probably among the very best qualified candidates to run for this office said schiff the ranking member on the house intelligence committee she was just an extraordinary secretary of state she has broad experience i think she ll make a tremendous commander in chief i don t think people will take that very seriously frankly he said i m much more concerned this week with what i heard sen sanders say on the gun issue sanders told a newspaper recently that shooting victims should not be able to sue gun manufacturers the sanders camp meanwhile responded that clinton had started the fight by declining three times on wednesday to say that sanders is qualified when asked point blank by morning joe host joe scarborough whether sanders was ready for the oval office clinton raised the senator s recent interview with the new york daily news well i think the interview raised a lot of serious questions clinton said i think of it this way the core of his campaign has been break up the banks and it it didn t seem in reading his answers that he understood exactly how that would work under dodd frank asked again whether sanders is qualified clinton dodged well i think he hadn t done his homework and he d been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadn t really studied or understood and that raises a lot of questions she said asked a third time clinton said she would leave it to voters to decide who of us can do the job the country needs 2016 by steven shepard by wednesday afternoon the sanders campaign was blasting out two fundraising emails reacting to clinton s comments on morning joe as well as to an anonymously sourced cnn report claiming her campaign was planning to disqualify him defeat him and then they can unify the party later the clinton campaign has been watching these wisconsin results come in and the delegate race of course is tight there but the reality is they re running out of patience so they re going to begin deploying a new strategy it s going to be called disqualify him defeat him and then they can unify the party later one email said emphasizing the need for cash to help mount a defense bernie sanders addresses supporters during a campaign rally at temple university on april 6 2016 in philadelphia pennsylvania getty polls in wisconsin haven t even been closed for 24 hours and we re already seeing the start of the clinton campaign s full on attack before the new york primary we knew they were getting nervous but candidly we didn t think they would go this negative so quickly we have to be ready for what comes next another sanders campaign email read a third email sent to reporters after sanders comments had exploded online quoted his attack on clinton and all but accused her of complicity in panamanian tax evasion schemes the sanders campaign s more aggressive tone comes along with a newfound swagger as the vermont senator has racked up wins though in states where the demographic mix favored him over clinton his aides have spoken more confidently about the once unthinkable possibility of him becoming the nominee and have speculated about challenging clinton at an open convention in july sanders has also outraised clinton for three months in a row pulling in more than 44 million in march alone before the evening rally at temple sanders met with the editorial board of the philadelphia inquirer and daily news i honestly believe we have the possibility of pulling off one of the greatest upsets in history he said according to philly com by thursday morning the clinton campaign was punching back more aggressively and mobilizing its allies to denounce sanders and donate money in a fundraising appeal to supporters campaign deputy communications director christina reynolds called it a ridiculous and irresponsible attack for someone to make not just against the person who is almost certainly going to be the nominee of their party this november but against someone who is one of the most qualified people to run for the presidency in the history of the united states show bernie sanders there are consequences for this kind of attack she wrote before asking recipients to donate 1 sanders doubled down on his remarks speaking to reporters thursday morning ahead of a speech to the afl cio in philadelphia slamming the media fortheir perceived lack of interest about why the middle class declines about wage and income disparity referring to the washington post headline that first stoked his ire clinton questions whether sanders is qualified to be president sanders remarked that he would stick to his message of economic populism but would not take clinton s words lying down if secretary clinton thinks that just because i m from a small state in vermont and we re gonna come here to new york and go to pennsylvania and they re gonna beat us up and they re gonna go after us in some kind of really uncalled for way that we re not gonna fight back well we got another you know they can guess again because that s not the case sanders said this campaign will fight back as sanders spoke to reporters in philadelphia clinton held an impromptu news conference in the bronx during which she shrugged off sanders comments i don t know why he s saying that but i will take bernie sanders over donald trump or ted cruz anytime she remarked so let s keep our eye on what s really at stake in this election we have republicans whose values are so antithetical to what s right for new york or right for america missing out on the
