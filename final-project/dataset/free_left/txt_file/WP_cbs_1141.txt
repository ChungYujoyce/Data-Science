the founder of the most successful hedge fund in the world says capitalism needs to be reformed and that the american dream is lost one of the most successful investors of all time is somebody you probably have never heard of despite his net worth of 18 billion ray dalio avoids extensive interviews and had not allowed news cameras full access to his firm bridgewater associates until our visit he predicted the 2008 financial crisis today he sees a prolonged period of sluggish economic growth and the threat of a confrontation between the u s and china but as we first reported in april there is a greater danger dalio wanted to warn us about so we figured it was a good investment of our time to do a deep dive on the principles of ray dalio when a billionaire invites you to his boat you gotta go bill whitaker it looks like a terrific day to be out on the water especially if he sends a chopper to take you we flew just north of nassau in the bahamas to meet ray dalio alucia is a 180 foot long research ship and ray dalio s pride and joy dalio who loves scuba diving bought it nine years ago he wouldn t tell us for how much but he had it decked out with scientific gear including submarines that can dive a half mile bill whitaker this is fantastic ray dalio isn t it great bill whitaker this is fantastic bill whitaker here we go before we go deeper we should tell you what s on his mind dalio who grew up middle class is alarmed about the growing divide between the haves and have nots he points out that over the span of a decade america s lowest paid workers had just a 14 percent chance of rising to the middle class bill whitaker what has happened to the american dream ray dalio i think the american dream is lost i think for the most part we don t even talk about what is the american dream and it s very different from when i was growing up bill whitaker but what s not working ray dalio it s not redistributing opportunity we can call it a wealth gap you can call it an income gap and so i think that if i was the president of the united states or it has to come from the top what i would do is recognize that this is a national emergency bill whitaker it s it s that bad ray dalio if you look at history if you have a group of people who have very different economic conditions and you have an economic downturn you have conflict in the 30s for example you had four major countries that were democracies that chose not to be democracies because they wanted leadership to bring order to the conflict i m not saying we re going to go there i m saying that right now it s a huge issue it s unfair and at the same time it s unproductive and at the same time it s threatens to split us dalio spends a lot of time thinking about where the markets and the world are going here at the financial powerhouse he built bridgewater associates is tucked in the woods of connecticut at the confluence of two rivers popular for fishing it s 50 miles from the chaos of wall street bill whitaker so you play it calmly ray dalio calmness critical you know the emotions ll kill you at 69 ray dalio bears little resemblance to any wall street shark he s more like a quirky professor dalio has joined fellow billionaire bill gates and others in their belief that the concentration of wealth in fewer and fewer hands is a threat to democracy bill whitaker so should taxes on people like you be raised ray dalio of course bill whitaker you say of course ray dalio of course one way or another the important thing is to take those tax dollars and make them productive bill whitaker very very recently the idea has been that cutting taxes on people like you will promote productivity ray dalio yeah i i that i that doesn t make any sense to me at all any sense at all bill whitaker so it s gotta be through taxation ray dalio yes am i saying something that s controversial bill whitaker it s just strange to hear it come from the mouth of a billionaire ray dalio i lived the american dream ya know his father was a jazz musician his mom a homemaker dalio bought his first stock when he was 12 with money he earned as a golf caddy today dalio s firm manages 160 billion it has all the excitement of an insurance agency dalio s analysts don t chase the gyrations of the market instead they quietly study centuries of history looking for patterns in stocks politics anything to help buy winning investments dalio is especially bullish on china which he predicts will be the greatest economy of the 21st century and america s greatest rival last year his global approach helped him earn a remarkable 15 percent for his clients while the dow dropped 6 percent bill whitaker we see the successful ray but you hit some bumps along the road on the way here ray dalio yeah of course bill whitaker like in the 80s you kind of bottomed out ray dalio oh yeah back then he was a wall street whiz kid absolutely certain a depression was on the horizon he was wrong very wrong he missed the boom of the 1980s bill whitaker i read that you called yourself an arrogant jerk ray dalio oh i was an arrogant jerk i had to borrow 10 000 from my dad to take care of my family bill whitaker you your ray dalio i mean i was broke bill whitaker your musician dad ray dalio my musician dad bill whitaker had to cough up 10 000 to keep you afloat ray dalio yeah and it was one of the best things really that ever happened to me because it changed my whole approach to decision making it gave me the humility that i needed to balance with my audacity he took note of his failures and other lessons over the next 25 years and wrote principles published by simon and schuster a division of cbs two million copies of the book have been sold worldwide it s dalio s recipe for creating what he calls an idea meritocracy ray dalio so what i mean is that i want a system in which the best ideas win out and i would describe it as tough love and i want to get there through radical truthfulness in other words people say what they honestly mean and radical transparency allows people to see things for themselves bill whitaker so does this get rid of the office backstabbing ray dalio oh yeah the bill whitaker politicking ray dalio oh yeah there s a rule here that you can t talk behind anybody s back you do that three times you re outta here everybody at bridgewater is monitoring everybody else almost all the time we saw it at this meeting where workers and managers gave each other grades in real time bill whitaker what sort of grades do you get ray dalio you can see like i get blasted laughter a lot there s a bit of a big brother vibe here that camera isn t ours it s theirs nearly every meeting is recorded and scrutinized bill whitaker can you understand somebody looking at it from the outside that sounds a little strange ray dalio no i understand it i understand bill whitaker it may be even a little creepy ray dalio i totally understand how that could sound that way you also have to understand that when you re doing this awhile and you look at other organizations and people are not open with each other and they re hearing a lot of spin that from this point of view that seems creepy bill whitaker do you have a high turnover ray dalio i would say in the first 18 months it s about 30 maybe a little over 30 percent bill whitaker but 30 percent sounds like a lot ray dalio some people describe it as an intellectual navy seals you know you go a certain percentage are not gonna make it and that s the way it is think what you want it s hard to argue with success bridgewater has made money for its clients 25 of the last 28 years whether it s investing or exploration dalio goes his own way bill whitaker while your fellow billionaires bezos branson elon musk they re all going into outer space they re headed towards mars and the moon you choose to go down why is that ray dalio well i as i say i find ocean exploration a lot more exciting a lot more important than space exploration right and then you think about it affects our lives so much more dalio routinely hosts scientists who have found new creatures in the deep like these that generate their own light there was also this off the coast of japan a live 26 foot long giant squid we didn t have that kind of luck but we had plenty of company ray dalio so they ll have tiger sharks bull sharks bill whitaker what kind is this buck that s a caribbean reef shark bill whitaker caribbean reef shark ray dalio sharks are beautiful powerful machines bill whitaker wow look at this ray dalio i don t understand the resource allocation of space to the ocean really in terms of return on investment you know i think about return on investment the return on investment down here is fabulous as we went deeper the ocean became barren the coral once here was gone a symptom of nature out of balance and dalio says a metaphor for what s happened to economic opportunity ray dalio if i come down here and i see the coral reefs are dying and the population is dying i know that we re out of balance it it doesn t take a genius to know that you re out of balance and you should do something so lately he s putting his money into public education to help restore economic balance to his home state his wife barbara handles that portfolio in april the dalio foundation pledged a record 100 million to connecticut schools bill whitaker so you and ray are partners in this endeavor barbara dalio we re not partners ray has his passion which is the ocean and my passion is public education bill whitaker so he does he does his passion and you do yours barbara dalio exactly the program takes a page out of bridgewater s investing strategies by relying on data to closely follow student performance and behavior so teachers can help at risk students it s paid dividends in just three years the number of kids on track to graduate in this high school is up by 8 percent ray dalio has agreed to donate half his 18 billion fortune to charity to help mend the system that made him rich with the right and left at each other s throats dalio warns time is running short ray dalio capitalism needs to be reformed it doesn t need to be abandoned so like anything like a car like anything a plane a school system anything it needs to be reformed in order to work better bill whitaker american capitalism is not sustainable that s what i hear you say ray dalio yes i don t think it s sustainable we re at a juncture we can do it together or we will do it in conflict that there will be a conflict between the rich and the poor bill whitaker which path do you think we will take ray dalio i play probabilities and i would say it s probably 60 40 65 35 that it will probably be done badly and that it would be a bad path but i m saying it doesn t have to be that way by realizing that it is a juncture maybe we can nudge just a little bit the probabilities so that we can have a better outcome produced by guy
