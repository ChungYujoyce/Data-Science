the next two hours when you are asked a question you will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer and 45 seconds for follow ups so let s begin senator sanders we haven t had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years here in south carolina the unemployment rate is even lower how will you convince voters that a democratic socialist can do better than president trump with the economy sanders well you re right the economy is doing really great for people like mr bloomberg and other billionaires applause sanders in the last three years last three years billionaires in this country saw an 850 billion increase in their wealth but you know what for the ordinary american things are not so good last year real wage increases for the average worker were less than 1 percent half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck 87 million americans have no health insurance or are underinsured 45 million people are struggling with student debt 500 000 people tonight are sleeping out on the street including 30 000 veterans that is not an economy that s working for the american people that s an economy working for the 1 percent we re going to create an economy for all not just wealthy campaign contributors bloomberg senator o donnell mayor bloomberg bloomberg senator cheering and applause bloomberg senator o donnell mayor bloomberg i ll let you respond to that do you think senator sanders economy would be better for america than president trump s bloomberg i i think that donald trump thinks it would be better if he s president i do not think so vladimir putin thinks that donald trump should be president of the united states and that s why russia is helping you get elected so you will lose to him sanders oh mr bloomberg let me tell mr putin ok i m not a good friend of president xi of china i think president xi is an authoritarian leader and let me tell mr putin who interfered in the 2016 election try to bring americans against americans hey mr putin if i m president of the united states trust me you re not going to interfere in any more american elections cheering and applause o donnell senator warren buttigieg look we know what the president what russia wants it s chaos sen elizabeth warren d ma presidential candidate so look the way i see this is that bernie is winning right now because the democratic party is a progressive party and progressive ideas are popular ideas even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don t want to say so applause warren you know but bernie and i agree on a lot of things but i think i would make a better president than bernie and the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and it s going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen bernie and i both wanted to help rein in wall street in 2008 we both got our chance but i dug in i fought the big banks i built the coalitions and i won bernie and i both want to see universal health care but bernie s plan doesn t explain how to get there doesn t show how we re going to get enough allies into it and doesn t show enough about how we re going to pay for it o donnell thank warren i dug in i did the work and then bernie s team trashed me for it we need a president who is going to dig in do the hard work and actually get it done progressives have got one shot and we need to spend it with a leader who will get something done king mayor buttigieg we want to bring you in this conversation cheering and applause king why would the russians want to be working on behalf of bernie sanders buttigieg i will tell you what the russians want they don t have a political party they want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way i mean look if you think the last four years has been chaotic divisive toxic exhausting imagine spending the better part of 2020 with bernie sanders vs donald trump laughter buttigieg think about what that will be like for this country applause buttigieg and meanwhile folks at home from south carolina to south bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us because it s right that there is a progressive majority an american majority that wants to see real change wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement but also there s a majority of the american people who i think right now just want to be able to turn on the tv see their president and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof cheering and applause buttigieg we have an opportunity to set a different tone o donnell mr steyer king mr steyer steyer bernie sanders analysis is right the difference is i don t like his solutions i don t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families i think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed the answer is not for the government to take over the private sector though the answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again king vice president biden applause steyer we need to well let me just finish because we need to have an alternative to donald trump i m talking about doubling the minimum wage cutting taxes by 10 percent for everybody who makes less than 250 000 and creating over 4 5 million good paying union jobs applause steyer donald trump thinks he s incompetent as a steward of the american economy we have to show that we can create a growing prosperous economy that works for american working people o donnell thank you mr steyer gayle king mr steyer thank you your time is up cheering and applause king vice president biden biden you know when we talk about progressive let s talk about being progressive walking distance of here is mother emanuel church nine people shot dead by a white supremacist bernie voted five times against the brady bill and wanted a waiting period cheering and applause biden no let me finish 2010 2015 josh a waiting period of 12 hours i m not saying he s responsible for the nine deaths but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what i suggest until you are cleared in addition to that being progressive he thought barack obama he wanted a primary he said we should primary barack obama someone should and in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it look folks this is let s talk about progressive progressive is getting things done and that s what we got done we got a lot done applause king senator sanders senator sanders your response sanders you know pete mentioned i m hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight laughter sanders i wonder why and maybe you know pete mentions what the american people want i will tell you pete what the american people want and joe what the american people want they don t want candidates to be running to billionaires for huge amounts of funding buttigieg all right let s clear this up once and for all sanders pete has gotten funding from over 50 billionaires buttigieg you ve got people believing something that is false this needs to be cleared up sanders joe i think has gotten a little bit more what the american people want by the way and a lot of the issues we ll be discussing tonight are issues i raised four years ago raising the minimum wage to a living wage 15 bucks an hour making public colleges and universities tuition free and finally doing what every other major country on earth does guaranteeing health care to all people as a human right through a medicare for all single payer system crosstalk buttigieg i can t allow i can t allow this to stand because it s just not true senator sanders king we re going to allow everyone an opportunity opportunity to respond buttigieg has got people believing something that is untrue about my campaign the idea that most of my campaign is funded by billionaires sanders i didn t say that pete buttigieg fifty people all right in charleston alone just in charleston over 2 000 people have contributed to my campaign that means the dollars that have come to my campaign just from charleston is more than the dollars that have come from the 50 people that you mentioned grassroots contributions are the life blood of my campaign in fact i shouldn t miss the opportunity if you re watching right now and you support my campaign go to peteforamerica com and chip in and if you are watching right now and you re a billionaire i will raise your taxes but if you d like to defeat donald trump please go to peteforamerica com and donate legal maximum of 2 800 if you re a billionaire king all right all right mayor buttigieg vice president biden i want to make i want to bring us to another topic we re in south carolina it s the first primary with a significant black voting population your numbers appear to be slipping with black voters and i m wondering if you could respond about why that is happening to you at this particular time biden well first of all the latest poll i saw my numbers i m still 15 points ahead the latest poll king yes yes you re correct you re correct applause biden but look look king but senator sanders is in striking distance of you you are within the margin of error in this state biden well it depends which look i ve earned the vote i ve worked like the devil to earn the vote of the african american community not just here but across the country i ve been coming here for years and years creating jobs here making sure that the port for example that employs one in 11 people we put 500 million in our administration just into this county we ve created jobs for people the people know me my entire career has been wrapped up in dealing with civil rights and civil liberties i don t expect anything i plan to earn the vote i m here to ask i m here to earn it but folks i intend to win in south carolina and i will win the african american vote here in south carolina applause king mr biden will you continue if you do not win south carolina you have said that south carolina will determine the outcome of this presidential race if you don t win south carolina will you continue in this race biden i will win south carolina applause king all right sir mayor bloomberg i d like to bring you into this conversation i want to ask you about a question that impacts the black and brown community you ve apologized for stop and frisk repeatedly what exactly are you apologizing for bloomberg we let it get out of control and when i realized that i cut it back by 95 percent and i ve apologized and asked for forgiveness i ve met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how i can better position myself and what i should have done and what i should do next time but let me tell you i have been working very hard we ve improved the school system for black and brown students in new york city we ve increased the jobs that are available to them we ve increased the housing that s available to them we have programs like the king but what more can you do about this issue mr mayor to put people s fears and skepticism to rest it continues to follow you bloomberg no well that s because it s in their interest to promote that but if you talk to the people in new york city i have over 100 black elected officials that have endorsed me a lot of them are in the audience tonight and i ve earned the respect of people in new york city i was the mayor of the largest most populous city in the united states for 12 years and people will tell you it s a lot better city today it is safer for everybody the school system is better the budget is under control we ve done the things that people need in new york city for all ethnicities applause king mayor buttigieg mayor to mayor mayor to mayor you ve certainly had your issues with the black community as well do you think the new york city s implementation of stop and frisk was racist buttigieg yes in effect it was because it was about profiling people based on their race and the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped white people too often and minorities too little and i m not here to score points i come at this with a great deal of humility because we have had a lot of issues especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community and i come to this with some humility because i m conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice none of us none of us have the experience the lived experience of for example walking down the street or in a mall and feeling feeling eyes on us regarding us as dangerous without knowing the first thing about us just because the color of our skin none of us had the experience that black women have had that drives that maternal mortality gap that we are all rightly horrified by of going into a doctor and being less likely to have your description of being in pain believed because of your race since we don t have the experience the next best thing we can do o donnell thank you mayor buttigieg is actually listen to those who do bloomberg i know wait a second i know that if i were black my success would have been a lot harder to achieve and i know a lot of black people that if they were white it would have been a lot easier for them that s just a fact and we ve got to do something about it than rather just demagogue about it o donnell senator klobuchar was the way that the mayor implemented stop and frisk racist klobuchar yes and i think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where we re going to go forward martin luther king once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly so when there is racism in the criminal justice system then we need to fix it and to me that means sentencing reform like the first step act and extending that to the states with the second step act it means equal opportunity because if we don t pass representative clyburn s bill out of south carolina here to invest in impoverished communities we re never going to get to that single garment of destiny and we also need to do something about child care about making sure we increase the minimum wage and then finally voting while we are all sitting here debating wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls georgia kicked 100 000 off as president i will get voting rights to be a reality for everyone applause king senator warren i m coming to you i want to direct this question to you because you because mayor bloomberg has said he got in this race late because he doesn t believe that any of you on stage can beat donald trump you said mayor bloomberg is not the safest candidate he is the riskiest candidate what did you mean by that warren i mean that mayor bloomberg let s think of it this way we re here in charleston and you know who is going to be in charleston later this week is donald trump he s going to be here to raise money for his buddy senator lindsey graham who funded lindsey graham s campaign for re election last time it was mayor bloomberg and that s not the only right wing senator that mayor bloomberg has funded in 2016 he dumped 12 million into the pennsylvania senate race to help re elect an anti choice right wing republican senator and i just want to say the woman challenger was terrific she lost by a single point in 2012 he scooped in to try to defend another republican senator against a woman challenger that was me it didn t work but he tried hard applause warren i don t care how much money mayor bloomberg has the core of the democratic party will never trust him he has not earned their trust i will and the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the democratic party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage applause king all right senator warren thank you mayor bloomberg would you like to respond mayor bloomberg bloomberg i have been training for this job since i stepped on the pile that was still smoldering on 9 11 i know what to do i ve shown i know how to run a country i ve run the city which is almost the same size bigger than most countries in the world i am not the i m the one choice that makes some sense i have the experience i have the resources and i have the record and all those sideshows that the senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that when people hired me to run new york city three times in an overwhelmingly democratic progressive city they elected me again and again o donnell mr vice president warren i was mentioned in this biden no crosstalk warren i d like to respond o donnell go ahead senator warren he called me out by name biden there was a i thought warren and referred to what i talk about as a sideshow you know this is personal for me when i was 21 years old i got my first job as a special education teacher i loved that job and by the end of the first year i was visibly pregnant the principal wished me luck and gave my job to someone else pregnancy discrimination you bet but i was 21 years old i didn t have a union to protect me and i didn t have any federal law on my side so i packed up my stuff and i went home at least i didn t have a boss who said to me kill it the way that mayor bloomberg is alleged to have said bloomberg i never said that oh come on warren to one of his pregnant employees people want a chance to hear audience boos people want a chance to hear from the women who have worked for crosstalk bloomberg i never said that and for the record if she was a teacher in new york city she would never have had that problem we treated our teachers the right way and the unions will tell you exactly that applause o donnell well mayor bloomberg senator warren has raised warren then let us let us have the women have an opportunity to speak the bloomberg corporations and mayor bloomberg himself have been accused of discrimination they are bound by nondisclosures so that they cannot speak if he says there is nothing to hide here then sign a blanket release and let those women speak out applause crosstalk warren so that they can tell their stories the way i can tell my story without having the fear they re going to be sued by a billionaire crosstalk o donnell thank you thank you we have a number of issues to discuss tonight but i want to give the mayor an opportunity to respond because she has raised concerns about women in your workplace at the last debate you said some of your female employees might not have liked some of your jokes did these women take your jokes wrong or were you wrong to make the jokes bloomberg probably wrong to make the jokes i don t remember what they were so i assume if it bothered them i was wrong and i apologize i m sorry for that but what happened here is we went back 40 years and we could only find three cases where women said they were uncomfortable nobody accused me of doing anything other than just making a comment or two and what the senator did suggest was that we release these women from the nondisclosure agreement i did that two days later and my company has said we will not use nondisclosure agreements ever again the senator has got it and i don t know what else she wants us to do warren oh i ll be clear bloomberg we re following exactly what she asked to do warren i ll tell you exactly what i want you to do bloomberg and the trouble is with this senator enough is never enough for what this i m going to start focusing on some of these other things we just cannot continue to re litigate this every time we did what she asked and thank you we ve probably made the world better because of it and by my company renouncing using these we probably changed hopefully the corporate landscape all across america buttigieg if you get nominated we ll be re litigating this all year crosstalk warren sorry mayor you did not do what i asked king senator warren that is a very serious charge that you leveled at the mayor warren yes king he told a woman to get an abortion what evidence do you have of that warren her own words king and mayor bloomberg could you respond to this bloomberg i never said it period end of story categorically never said it when it was accused when i was accused of doing it we couldn t figure out what she was talking about but right now i m sorry if she heard what she thought she heard or whatever happened i didn t take any pleasure in that and we ve just got to go on but i never said it come on warren what i asked the mayor to do is to do a release of all people who have discrimination claims bloomberg we are doing that senator crosstalk o donnell we want to get to the we want to get to the issue we want to get to the issue of electability and the ideological difference within the democratic party warren ok o donnell senator sanders the cost of your agenda yesterday you released information about how you will pay for your major proposals but not all of your details are clear you ve proposed more than 50 trillion in new spending sanders over a 10 year period o donnell you ve said medicare for all will cost 30 trillion sanders over a 10 year period o donnell but you can only explain how you ll pay for just about half of that can you do the math for the rest of us sanders how many hours do you have king two crosstalk biden that s the problem sanders no it s not the problem all right let s talk about medicare for all i m sure you re familiar with the new study that just came out of yale university published in lancet magazine one of the prestigious medical journals in the world you know what it said medicare for all will lower health care costs in this country by 450 billion a year and save 68 000 lives of people who otherwise would have died what we need to do is to do what every other major country on earth does guarantee health care to all people not have thousands of separate insurance plans which are costing us some 500 billion a year to administer our plan we have laid out options all over the place one of the options is a 7 5 percent payroll tax on employers which will save them substantial sums of money another klobuchar bernie let me let me respond to this crosstalk sanders you asked me a question o donnell senator klobuchar does the math add up klobuchar no the math does not add up in fact just on 60 minutes this weekend he said he wasn t going to rattle through the nickels and the dimes well let me tell you how many nickels and dimes we re talking about nearly 60 trillion do you know how much that is for all of his programs sanders not true klobuchar that is three times the american economy not the federal government the entire american economy the medicare for all plan alone on page eight clearly says that it will kick 149 million americans off their current health insurance in four years that is true as one prominent democrat once said we should pay attention to where the voters of this country are bernie that prominent democrat was barack obama a few months ago and i think that s what we should do they are not with you on spending nearly 60 trillion sanders first of all klobuchar what i think we should do is make things more affordable nonprofit public option make sure we re paying for long term care better take on the pharmaceuticals like you and i have done together o donnell thank you senator klobuchar and do something for the people of america king thank you senator klobuchar crosstalk klobuchar instead of a bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers king mr steyer mr steyer buttigieg i think we re talking about math king we ll get to you mr sanders buttigieg let s talk about it steyer can i say something sanders first of all crosstalk steyer no let me go sanders no i think tom i think she was talking about my plan not yours buttigieg i think we were talking about math and it doesn t take two hours to do the math sanders no no well let s talk about math buttigieg because let s talk about what it adds up to sanders let s talk about math buttigieg let s talk about math indeed ok so here s the math sanders if we do nothing is what buttigieg no here s the math sanders excuse me can i respond to the attack crosstalk buttigieg to do nothing is what will happen crosstalk o donnell senator sanders you are allowed a quick response and then we would like to allow the other candidates crosstalk sanders listen to the moderator guys o donnell senator sanders senator sanders sanders the moderator is it my turn biden this helps a lot doesn t o donnell senator sanders you have been name checked you are allowed to respond sanders ok what the health and human services have said in analyzing health care costs what yale recent yale study has said is that your program would cost some 50 trillion over a 10 year period we would continue to pay in some cases 10 times more for the same exact prescription drugs what every study out there conservative or progressive says medicare for all will save money ours will cost about 45 billion not 60 trillion crosstalk klobuchar bernie i was talking about i was talking about crosstalk king we would like senator sanders we would like to bring mr steyer in on this conversation crosstalk steyer mr steyer please klobuchar i was talking about all your programs crosstalk steyer excuse me amy this conversation shows a huge risk for the democratic party we are looking at a party that has decided that we re either going to support someone who is a democratic socialist or somebody who has a long history of being a republican and let me say that i got into this race because i wanted to fight for economic justice for racial justice and to make sure we had climate justice for the american people and i am scared applause if we cannot pull this party together if we go to one of those extremes we take a terrible risk of re electing donald trump o donnell thank you mr steyer steyer and that is something i still have some time and let me say this o donnell thank you mr steyer steyer that is a risk that will hurt the american people in a way that none of us on this stage should be willing to risk o donnell thank you let s keep this topic going mayor pete buttigieg so let s do this math senator sanders at one point said it was going to be 40 trillion then it was 30 trillion then it was 17 trillion that s an incredible shrinking price tag at some point has said it is unknowable to even see what the price tag would be now there are new numbers i ll tell you exactly what it adds up to it adds to four more years of donald trump kevin mccarthy as speaker of the house and the inability to get the senate into democratic hands the time has come for us to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters not only is this a way to get donald trump reelected cheering and applause buttigieg we got a house to worry about we got a senate to worry about and this is this is really important look biden hello buttigieg if you want to keep the house in democratic hands you might want to check with the people who actually turned the house blue 40 democrats who are not running on your platform crosstalk buttigieg they are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can cheering and applause buttigieg i want to send those democrats back to the united states house king vice president biden cheering and applause buttigieg let s listen to them king vice president biden buttigieg when they say that they don t want to be out there defending senator sanders crosstalk king thank you mayor buttigieg thank you mayor buttigieg vice president biden please biden whoa whoa whoa i guess the only way you do this is jump in and speak twice as long as you should laughter biden here s the deal here s the deal look a guy who s a friend of mine down here named fritz hollings he passed away he said you want to know what a woman will do look what they have done look what they have done you talk about concerned about race well my good friend on the end of this platform he in fact bought a system that was a private prison system after after he knew that in fact what happened was they hog tied young men in prison here in this state they in fact made sure that in georgia they did not have health care for the people who were being held they in fact went on and he said after he knew that he bought it and then he said he was proud of his accomplishment you talk about what we re talking about with bernie bernie in fact hasn t passed much of anything the fact of the matter is steyer ok but i get to answer cheering and applause biden no no no steyer i get to answer that biden the look look steyer no that biden fact is steyer you re out of time i get to answer biden here s the deal i m not out of time you spoke over time and i m going to talk here s the deal cheering and applause biden here s the deal the fact of the matter is look at what s happening here look at what s happening here we have to win the senate back and by the way i went into all of those races that got 41 new democrats the majority of them are supporting me for president and endorsing me cheering and applause o donnell and mr vice president i have to allow yes mr mayor crosstalk o donnell mr mayor you re allowed to respond steyer i bought stock in a prison company thinking they would do a better job and i investigated and i sold it bloomberg ok biden but you knew you knew when you bought it they d done that crosstalk steyer i get to answer this question and in fact since then i have worked to end the use of private prisons in my home state and we have ended it i have started a bank to support black ownership of businesses women ownership of businesses and latino owners of businesses because this financial service industry is prejudiced i have worked tirelessly on this and you know i m right you wrote the crime bill that you called crosstalk biden where we come from that s called tommy come lately bloomberg there are other people here crosstalk steyer crime bill that put hundreds of thousands of young black and latino men in prison biden not true bloomberg ok let me say something crosstalk o donnell thank you mr steyer steyer there s something going on here i have worked for racial justice o donnell thank you king thank you mr steyer steyer completely and that is an absolute unfair statement o donnell thank you mr steyer klobuchar all i know crosstalk biden tommy come lately king mayor bloomberg mayor bloomberg klobuchar if we spend the next four months tearing our party apart we re going to watch donald trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart biden look klobuchar so my argument here is that we need to get back to what s happening right now we have a clear choice of who s going to lead this party and i am the only one in the new hampshire debate when asked if we had a problem with a socialist leading the ticket that raised my hand i like bernie we came in together to the senate but i do not think that this is the best person to lead the ticket applause klobuchar and if you want to talk about getting things done and make a comparison according to vanderbilt university in tennessee last congress i was the most effective democrat in the u s senate on 15 metrics bernie and elizabeth were in the bottom half it matters it matters if you can actually get things done bloomberg ok gayle klobuchar it is not just who talks the best who actually gets things done and especially with the african american community there have been a lot of broken promises and i think having someone that keeps their promises and follows through and is going to get things done for these people matters and that s why i ask for your support crosstalk king mayor bloomberg please bloomberg let s just go on the record they talk about 40 democrats 21 of those were people that i spent 100 million to help elect all of the new democrats that came in and put nancy pelosi in charge and gave the congress the ability to control this president cheering and applause bloomberg i i got them number two when you talk about money let s put this in perspective the federal budget is 4 5 trillion a year we get 3 5 trillion in revenue we lose 1 trillion a year that s why the federal budget deficit is right now the debt is 20 trillion going up to 21 we just cannot afford some of this stuff people talk about but if you crosstalk bloomberg let me finish if you keep on going we will elect bernie bernie will lose to donald trump and donald trump and the house and the senate and some of the statehouses will all go red and then between gerrymandering and appointing judges for the next 20 or 30 years we re going to live with this catastrophe o donnell mayor bloomberg thank you cheering and applause o donnell i will allow senator sanders a quick response and then senator warren sanders thank you very much norah o donnell senator sanders a quick response and then senator warren sanders thank you very much mayor bloomberg has a solid and strong and enthusiastic base of support the problem is they re all billionaires booing sanders now if you look oh on the other hand of the last 50 polls that have been done nationally mr bloomberg i beat trump 47 of those 50 times if you look at battleground states like michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania polling just done this sunday bloomberg the polls aren t the election sanders i beat trump and if you want to beat trump what you re going to need is an unprecedented applause sanders grassroots movement of black and white and latino native american and asian people who are standing up and fighting for justice o donnell thank you sanders that s what our movement is about bloomberg can anybody can anybody in this room imagine moderate republicans going over and voting for him sanders absolutely bloomberg and you have to do that or you can t win warren you know that is o donnell thank you senator warren warren that is the problem and that is that a progressive agenda is popular mayor bloomberg and for everyone on this stage we talk about how to build a future that s what matters i talk to people in selfie lines every day who tell me about the importance of getting real help on health care it s why i also have a way to pay for health care that doesn t raise taxes on middle class families but it s so much more than that as democrats we need to speak to the future we can build together we need to speak of the prosperity we can build together how about a wealth tax in america because with a 2 cent tax on just the top one tenth of 1 percent we have a chance to invest in universal child care for every one of our babies to really level the playing field o donnell thank you warren put 50 billion into historically black colleges and universities o donnell thank you senator applause warren and start closing the racial wealth gap by canceling student loan debt for 43 million americans crosstalk warren we need to talk about our aspirations our hopes this is a moment o donnell senator warren to choose hope over fear o donnell senator thank you warren this is our moment o donnell senator thank you cheering and applause o donnell we have to take a quick break when we come back the democratic presidential debate continues right after this only on cbs cheering and applause commercial break applause king i m gayle king with norah o donnell joining us now on the question here in charleston south carolina are cbs news colleagues the a team bill whitaker of 60 minutes chief washington correspondent that s major garrett and margaret brennan moderator of face the nation we re going to begin with you vice president biden for this part just across the street as you mentioned at the top of the debate is the theater sic where nine people were shot and killed inside the mother emanuel church we all remember that day back in 2015 and every day in our country over 100 people die from gun violence you all have plans i know on this stage to address the gun crisis but congress has not been able to pass a major gun legislation in a quarter of a century and just think about this in those 25 years we ve had columbine newtown parkland las vegas we could go on and on vice president biden i want to start with you why should anyone have faith that you re the one who can get this done now biden because i m the only one that ever got it done nationally i beat the nra twice i got assault weapons banned i got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them i got them eliminated except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in florida and it was not reauthorized in addition to that i passed the brady bill with waiting periods i led that fight but my friend to my right and others have in fact also gave into the gone manufacturers absolute immunity imagine if i stood here and said we d give immunity to drug companies we would give immunity to tobacco companies that has caused carnage on our streets 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability more than all the wars including vietnam from that point on carnage on our streets and i want to tell you if i m elected nra i m coming for you and gun manufacturers i m going to take you on and i m going to beat you i m the only one who has done it applause buttigieg that s why we have got to change what washington can deliver crosstalk warren so this is about being able to dig in and talk about what really it s going to take to get something done i ve been in the senate what i ve seen is gun safety legislation introduced get a majority and then doesn t pass because of the filibuster understand this the filibuster is giving a veto to the gun industry it gives a veto to the oil industry it s going to give a veto on immigration until we re willing to dig in and say that if mitch mcconnell is going to do to the next democratic president what he did to president obama and that is try to block every single thing he does that we are willing to roll back the filibuster go with the majority vote and do what needs to be done for the american people crosstalk king we re going to stay on this top and allow senator biden and i can beat mitch mcconnell warren understand this many people on this stage do not support rolling back the filibuster until we re ready to do that we can t have real change o donnell i want to allow senator sanders to respond because you ve gone after the insurance industry you ve taken on pharmaceutical companies and you ve taken on big tech why did you vote repeatedly to give gun manufacturers a pass sanders well you know joe has voted for terrible trade agreements booing sanders no no no no no joe voted for the war in iraq my point was not to be i have cast thousands of votes including bad votes that was a bad vote i have today a d minus voting record from the nra thirty years ago i likely lost a race for the one seat for congress in vermont because 30 years ago i opposed i supported a ban on assault weapons thirty years ago right now my view is we need to expand background checks end the gun show loophole and do what the american people want not what the nra wants biden ok but wait a second crosstalk buttigieg the opposition to the filibuster is not a discretion from a long time ago bloomberg i think she recognized me thank you i have a 6 million person organization around this country moms demand action and everytown applause bloomberg we have put background checks we have got background checks in 20 states so you can do it it s congress that can t seem to do it and i don t know why we think they re going to do it the vice president voted for a death bill and supported the nra and certainly senator sanders has supported the nra but we can do this we have just got to stop talking about it klobuchar but the way we do it the way we do it is having someone leading the ticket from a part of the country that we actually needs the votes so i have long supported the assault weapon ban i am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can t go out and get an ak 47 biden i wrote that law klobuchar that bill along with you didn t write that bill i wrote that bill biden i wrote the bill the violence against women act klobuchar ok you did you that biden that took out of the hands of people who abused their klobuchar ok we ll have a fact check look at this biden let s look at the fact check klobuchar oh my goodness biden the only thing that the boyfriend loophole is was not covered i couldn t get that covered you in fact when you were as a senator tried to get it covered and mitch mcconnell is holding it up on his desk right now and we re going to lose the violence against women act across the board klobuchar ok so if i could finish i have the bill anyone can check it out to close the boyfriend loophole also to close the charleston loophole is another bill that is out there universal background checks but let me say how we win this we have got to win in the middle of the country and while everyone talks about winning rural areas suburban areas i m the only one up here with a receipts that has actually repeatedly while being for the assault weapon ban won in republican congressional districts over and over again including michele bachmann s district so having someone that can lead the ticket that can bring people with her is the way you get gun safety legislation i look at these proposals and say do they hit my uncle dick in the deer stand they do not so coming from a proud hunting state and still being able to pass this legislation is going to be the key o donnell senator klobuchar thank you we want to allow many people to get in on this topic mayor buttigieg buttigieg i m definitely on board with the part about sending up somebody from the middle of the country but i want to come back to this question about the filibuster because this is not some long ago bad vote that bernie sanders took this is a current bad position that bernie sanders holds applause and we re in south carolina how are we going to deliver a revolution if you won t even support a rule change we are in this state booing buttigieg we are in the state where strom thurmond used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation repeatedly no less a senate traditional figure than harry reid has called for it to go it has got to go because otherwise washington will not deliver i was in high school when the columbine shooting happened and i remember everybody in washington saying never again we ll never let this happen again and then a second school shooting generation has now been produced shame on us if we allow there to be a third and also crosstalk buttigieg in terms of making the case i think it wouldn t be a bad idea for somebody to illustrate from the perspective of the a veteran why the kinds of weaponry anything remotely like what i trained on in order to go serve in a war zone has no business being sold anywhere near an american school or church or neighbor applause king all right senator sanders please sanders thirty years ago i supported a ban on assault weapons mike bloomberg has started a very good organization moms demand actions congratulations bloomberg thank you sanders they have credited me with gun sense as you know bloomberg yes we did sanders furthermore furthermore it is my view the time is now and joe made this point look at the end of the day we need to rally the american people here is the good news because of all these disgusting and horrific mass shootings the american people now understand that we must be aggressive on gun safety not be dictated to by the nra and i am proud that i have a d minus voting record from the nra if elected president it will get worse than that applause king all right mr steyer please mr steyer steyer look it isn t a question of the american people deciding that we have too much gun violence everyone in america knows we have too much gun violence the problem we have is that corporations have bought washington d c the gun manufacturers own the senate of the united states so even though more than 90 percent of americans want mandatory background checks on every gun purchase we can t get it through the senate so the question you have to ask yourself is how do we change the senate of the united states in a material way and there are two things that s why i am for term limits of 12 years for every congressperson and senator to change who s in charge to get rid of mitch mcconnell and lindsey graham and ted cruz applause but i am also senator sanders is right we need to win a huge victory across the board king all right mr steyer steyer democrats need to go to the grassroots i built one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the united states king your time s up sir steyer the way to win at the grassroots is tell the truth and organize king your time s up sir bill whitaker steyer that s what it s going to take in 2020 king your time s up sir bill whitaker whitaker let s talk about education south carolina s schools score in the bottom half of the national assessment black students here consistently score worse than white students mayor bloomberg a key element of your response to failing schools in new york city was a dramatic increase in public charter schools as president would you pursue that same strategy and seek to expand charter schools nationwide bloomberg i m not sure they re appropriate every place i can only tell you in new york they provided parents with an alternative to send students to them we had the charter schools are mixed in with the non charter public schools because our charter schools are public schools as well they ve helped each other i saw a statistic the other day when i came into office zero new york city schools were in the top 25 of the state when i left 23 out of 25 were from new york city we ve cut the gap between the rich and the poor we ve made an enormous difference in all of the options that parents have i raised teacher salaries by 43 percent i put an extra 5 billion into our school system i value education it is the only way to solve the poverty problem is to get people a good education and rather than just talk about it in new york we actually did it applause whitaker senator warren warren so this is one thing where a president can make a big difference all by herself and i m going to start with my secretary of education my secretary of education will be someone who has taught in public school applause my secretary of education will be someone who believes in public education and my secretary of education will believe that public dollars should stay in public schools applause one more thing my secretary of education will believe that it is time to get rid of high stakes testing we need to support our children but look we want to build a future in this country we build a future by investing in our children i ve got a plan to put 800 billion new federal dollars into our public schools whitaker thank you thank you senator warren education is not free we must invest in the future of our children applause whitaker senator sanders sanders this campaign our campaign our campaign is about changing american priorities instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires we re going to have high quality universal childcare for every family in this country because the psychologists tell us 0 to 4 are the most important years of human development we are going to triple funding for low income title i schools because kids education should not depend upon the zip code in which they live we re going to make public colleges and universities tuition free through a tax on wall street speculation and we re going to move to make certain that no teacher in america earns less than 60 000 a year whitaker thank you senator sanders we want great teachers klobuchar can i whitaker mayor buttigieg buttigieg look the best thing that we can do to support public education is to support public educators i m a little biased because i m married to one and i get an education about education every day i come home i have seen how teachers are expected to dip into their own pockets to furnish their classrooms teachers are being expected to handle the mental health challenges that their students are facing because we don t have an adequate mental health system to support kids and now some politicians because they aren t willing to face the need for commonsense gun law are expecting teachers to somehow transform themselves into highly trained armed guards when there s a threat to a classroom we have to show not only with compensation but with support for the profession overall our regard for those who are educating our kids and yes that means a secretary of education who will support teachers it also means investing whitaker thank you crosstalk buttigieg i m proposing an education access crosstalk warren one way we one way we can support our teachers is to cancel student loan debt crosstalk whitaker we re going to pass this on to major garrett candidates good evening candidates good evening warren people across this country are being crushed by student loan debt this is an issue we need to talk about crosstalk buttigieg and that s what my plan would do through the education crosstalk garrett as we all know as we all know the political conversation in our country is interactive and because of our partner twitter this debate is no different so i want to put a question from twitter to you senator klobuchar this is from casey pennington how will your policies address and ensure affordable housing and education equity for minimum wage workers klobuchar thank you this is one of the first times we ve talked about housing and i put forward an extensive policy i think when i ve looked at this both in my job in local government and in the senate one sure way we can make sure that kids get a good start is if they have a roof over their head and a stable place to live so the way you do that is first of all taking care of the section 8 backlog of applicants there are literally hundreds of thousands of people waiting and i have found a way to pay for this and a way to make sure that people get off that list and get into housing secondly you create incentives for affordable housing to be built and third to help people pay for it and i want to make clear given south carolina and the rural population as well as urban that this isn t just an urban problem it s a big urban problem but it s also a rural problem where we have housing deserts and people want to have their businesses located there but they re not able to get housing so for me it s building a coalition and i actually like to get these things done and to the way you do it is by building a coalition between urban and rural so you can pass affordable housing and finally get it done warren this is a point crosstalk garrett senator warren hold on one second because i want to i want to warren this is a point where we need to talk about race though garrett i understand crosstalk warren it is not enough to talk about housing neutrally biden can we just speak up when we want to is that the idea warren and just be race blind it is important to recognize the role that the federal government played for decades and decades in discriminating against african americans having an opportunity to buy homes applause that s red lining garrett mayor warren and while mayor bloomberg was blaming the housing crash of 2008 on african americans and on latinos in fact i was out there fighting for a consumer agency to make sure people never get cheated again on their mortgages we have a i have a housing plan and what it has in it specifically garrett senator warren thank you warren is a piece garrett senator warren thank you warren to deal with the effects of red lining we can no longer pretend that everything is race neutral we have got to address race consciously what s happening in this country applause garrett ok mayor bloomberg please we were going to ask you about this i want to give you a chance to respond because in addition to what senator warren just said on twitter she called you a liar and a borderline racist because of what you said about red lining bloomberg yes she s i m sorry but unfortunately she s misinformed on red lighting you can go back and look at the record i fought against it before 08 the crisis during 08 and after that red lining is not the problem with the mortgage market but it was a problem for the communities where it was done and we stopped that let me also say because just since i have the floor for a second that i really am surprised that all of these my fellow contestants up here i guess would be the right word for it laughter given nobody pays attention to the clock i m surprised they show up because i would have thought after i did such a good job in beating them last week that they d be a little bit afraid to do that audience boos but let me just say when you re talking about affordable housing we created 175 000 units of affordable housing in new york city and i listened to them they re in congress and they say they can t get it done can t get it done but if you change something like the president they would no you have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle and then you can get stuff done i did it in new york city i got the republican state senate to vote for gay marriage virtually before anybody else in this country you can work across the aisle you just have to know how to deal with people garrett mayor bloomberg thank you very much back to you bill whitaker vice president biden black men earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by white men are about twice as likely to be unemployed five times more likely to be incarcerated conditions that ripple across black families and have endured during both democratic and republican administrations how do you convince black voters that you can change years of inequities biden two ways number one my entire life i ve been involved with the black community i was a public defender i worked in the projects i came along and the first thing i did as the chairman of the judiciary committee extended the voting rights act eventually for 25 years and i have been deeply involved and my first effort i had as a councilman was doing away with red lining in the county the way we do this we ve got to help them create wealth and that s why we double the amount of money that is available for young entrepreneurs and black entrepreneurs are as successful as any other group of people in the country we go from 1 5 billion to 3 billion taking 30 billion off the sidelines that s how you create wealth secondly i provide for the opportunity for first time home buyers to be able to have a 15 000 tax credit so they can get the mortgage at the front end and be able to keep it thirdly i go after those people who are involved gentrification because what s happening is we re moving people out of their neighborhoods in ways that in fact make no sense they re being bought out you cannot find a place to live and thirdly i make sure that with regard to housing we allow people look right now if you live in a black neighborhood and you have the same exact house as the guy across the street in a white neighborhood has your house is valued significantly less than the white the same exact house we ve got to deal with the institutional racism whitaker thank you mr vice president biden i note how you cut me off all the time but i m not going to be quiet anymore ok whitaker mr steyer steyer every single policy area in the united states has a gigantic subtext of race we re talking about education we re talking about criminal justice we re talking about housing we re talking about loans i started a bank to basically correct the injustice in the financial services industry basically to make loans to black owned latino owned and women owned businesses we ve supported over 8 000 affordable housing units but more than that i believe i m the only person on this stage who believes in reparations for slavery applause steyer something happened we should have a formal commission on race to retell the story of the last 400 plus years in america of african americans of systematic legal injustice discrimination and cruelty but also of 400 plus years of contribution in terms of building the united states of america and leading the united states of america from a moral standpoint whitaker thank you mr steyer crosstalk brennan senator klobuchar next question new topic new topic senator klobuchar buttigieg for this whole campaign i don t know where you got the impression brennan if you could honor the rules of the debate thank you senator klobuchar i d like to change topics and ask you rural areas have populations who are older sicker and poorer than non rural communities and they have to travel farther to get medical help when they need it expanding coverage is going to be useless if there are no providers to go to so how would you ensure that there is available health care in rural areas klobuchar people aren t always aware i know you are in south carolina about how much poverty there is particularly child poverty in rural areas so the answer is one size doesn t fit all and one of the ways you do this right now we have something called critical access hospitals so they re designated for rural areas and actually i am leading the lead democrat on a bill to extend that to have other types of hospitals like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered the other issue is we don t have enough personnel and so that s where we get to this education plan and i don t want agree with some of my colleagues here about putting hard earned taxpayer money into rich kids going to college what i think we need to do instead is look at what our needs are in our economy we re going to have a million openings for home health care workers particularly in rural areas that we don t know how to fill we re going to have over 100 000 openings for nursing assistants we re not going to have a shortage of sports marketing degrees we re going to have a shortage of plumbers and nurses so putting incentives in place with how we do loan payback making one and two year degrees free and then of course creating loan payback programs if people will go especially medical students into rural areas final thing is comprehensive immigration reform i have passed brennan senator time klobuchar i have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas we need to expand that brennan mayor buttigieg the floor is yours would you like same question buttigieg yes so when i was born there was no difference in your life expectancy if you were born in a rural area or a city now the gap is the biggest it has been in a generation and that is particularly affecting black rural families in places like south carolina we re seeing hospital closures right and left and we re seeing them in particular in states where medicaid was not expanded something that is hurting black and poor white families and is largely the result of racial voters suppression see all of these things are connected housing wages the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform all of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation which is happening on everything from the purging of voter rolls to the closing of voting locations and that harms everyone brennan you re out of time sir buttigieg it s why in my frederick douglass plan for comprehensively dealing with these issues part of the core of it is a 21st century voting rights act applause brennan senator sanders sanders yes i m very proud working with congressman jim clyburn south carolina that we increased funding for the community health center program by 11 billion as part of the affordable care act which now provides for 9 million americans access to primary health care dental care mental health counseling and low cost prescription drugs in that bill we also put 2 billion into a program which would provide debt forgiveness for doctors nurses dentists we have a major dental affordable crisis in this country to make sure that they are practicing in underserved areas the advantage of a medicare for all health care program because it s not driven by profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies we will have health care for all people in all parts of this country crosstalk buttigieg but in order for any of that to happen it has to pass and we re talking about a plan that brennan thank you next topic gayle buttigieg even goes beyond even what they do king i m sorry we re going to go to mayor bloomberg we re going to change topics mayor bloomberg as mayor of new york you declared war on obesity you banned trans fats from restaurants and you tried to do the same thing with large surgary drinks so if you become president will you push those policies on the national level as well bloomberg well i think what s right for new york city isn t necessarily right for all the other cities otherwise you would have a naked cowboy in every city so let s get serious here but i do think it s the government s job to have good science and to explain to people what science says or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives the we are a country where there are too many people that are obese we should do something about that but just a look what happened with smoking we did ban smoking in new york city in public places restaurants offices and that sort of thing and it has spread across america across europe across latin america even into places in the middle east and into the far east it has saved an enormous number of lives so it just goes to show if you have good public health then you can do things and one of the great problems today you read about the virus what s really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago so there s nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing applause bloomberg and he has defunded he had defunded centers for disease control cdc so we don t have the organization we need this is a very serious thing as you see the stock market is falling apart because people are really worried and they should be king we re going to talk about that bloomberg we don t have anybody to respond i m sorry king we re going to talk about that in our next segment before i leave you are new yorkers living longer because of your policies bloomberg there s no question about that king all right bloomberg before i left life expectancy in new york city had grown by three years during our 12 years in office such that when i left it was three years greater than the national average applause king all right vice president biden please vice president biden biden look one of the things we have to do we have a thing in the defense department called darpa a special operation thing to find out all the things we have to deal to make us safer they came up with the internet i mean they came up with the internet they came up with the whole idea of stealth technology i m going to do the same thing at the national institute of health we re going to focus at least 50 billion over the first five years on focusing on obesity diabetes alzheimer s and cancer and we re going to make that investment because no one else is willing to make that investment we can in fact find cures if we make the investment and we can get that done the american people support it even republicans will support it we have to focus on extending life saving life and making people put them in a position to be able to live longer and more securely applause king all right senator sic biden thank you o donnell senator klobuchar senator sanders wants to legalize marijuana on day one of his presidency applause o donnell and is promising to expunge the record of anyone who has been arrested for possession as a former prosecutor is that a a realistic promise klobuchar well it is realistic to want to legalize marijuana i want to do that too and i also think you need to look back and at people s records and you maybe can t do it on day one as he said i think you want to have a process that you go through because there s too many people that have things on their records that have stopped them from getting jobs i think a lot of what we also need to do is to make sure that when we do this that we have money for treatment and it s not necessarily because of marijuana it is because of things like opioids and the like and that s why one of the first plans i put out was for treatment because if you want to make the criminal justice system work you don t want to have repeat customers and you want to help people to get off of drugs and the way you do that is with drug courts the way you do that by the way is with my proposal for a clemency board in the white house so that you don t have a president that pell mell gives pardons to his buddies and to white collar offenders but that instead you have a set process that you use that s fair and is outside of the justice department and while getting their advice king all right thank you senator klobuchar sanders norah can i respond king mayor bloomberg biden can i respond to that as well sanders can i respond i was mentioned king i d like to get your thoughts on this because you have called marijuana another addictive drug that we ve never done research on bloomberg look the first thing you do is we should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount for dealers yes but for the average person no and you should expunge the records of those that got caught up in this before applause number two we re not going to take it away from states that have already done it but number three you should listen to the scientists and the doctors they say go very slowly they haven t done enough research and the evidence so far is worrisome before we get all our kids particularly kids in their late teens boys even more than girls where this may be damaging their brains until we know the science it s just nonsensical to push ahead but the cat s out of the bag so some states have it you re not going to take it away get rid of the decriminalize the possession king all right thank you mr mayor o donnell senator sanders you were name checked sanders thank you all right look you re right we have a criminal justice system today that is not only broken it is racist got more people in jail than any other country on earth including china and one of the reasons for that is a horrific war on drugs so i do believe that on day one we will change the federal controlled substance act which if you can believe it now equates heroin with marijuana that s insane we re going to take marijuana out of that and effectively legalize marijuana in every state in the country what we are also going to do is move to expunge the records of those people who were arrested for possession of marijuana applause and i ll tell you what else we re going to do we re going to provide help to the african american latino native american community to start businesses to sell legal marijuana rather than let a few corporations control the legalized marijuana market king all right senator sanders thank you biden i wrote the drug court bill king we passed the halfway mark biden can i respond to this i wrote the i wrote the bill that set up drug courts king all right thank you vice president biden we will get back to you the cbs news democratic presidential debate will continue right after the break commercial break o donnell welcome back the cbs news democratic debate each of you is campaigning for the role as commander in chief where you will command 1 3 million u s troops and be responsible for protecting america s national security there are also 53 000 here in south carolina you said senator warren you said you wanted to bring home all troops from the middle east and then you walked that back to say you want to bring home combat troops warren i do o donnell how does that protect america s national security warren look a president s job first job is to keep america safe and an important part of that is to have a strong military all three of my brothers served in the military and i understand how much the military sacrifices how much their families sacrifice and how much they are willing to put on the line that means that we have a sacred responsibility to them and that is not to use our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily we are not winning in afghanistan we are not winning in the middle east what we need to do is we need to use all of the tools in our toolbox we need a strong military we also need a strong state department those are our eyes and ears on the ground they are our frontlines in diplomacy we need a strong economy and to work worldwide on that economy and we need strong alliances we need to know the difference between our friends and between dictators who would do us harm and we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators we need not to cut and run on our allies and we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators we need not to cut and run on our allies we need an approach that keeps us safe by using all of the tools in a measured way o donnell mayor bloomberg voters have not heard much about your foreign policy views would you pull all combat troops out of the middle east bloomberg no you want to cut it back as much as you can but i think if we learned something from 9 11 people plan things overseas and execute them here we have to be able to stop terrorism and there s no guarantees that you re going to be able to do it but we have to have some troops in places where terrorists congregate and to not do so is just irresponsible we shouldn t be fighting wars that we can t win we should go to war only as a last resort nobody argues with that but this is a dangerous world and if we haven t learnt that after 9 11 i don t know what s going to teach us what to this we have to do something and i think the budget that we the things that i ve seen recently convinced me that the military today is better prepared than they have been in an awful long time and that the monies they are spending on the war of weapons we need for the next war and not for the last a common mistake that they re not making now o donnell thank you bloomberg they re doing a good job o donnell thank you mayor bloomberg gayle king mayor buttigieg i d like to go to you as the only veteran on stage can you weigh in on this buttigieg well the first time i ever set foot in south carolina it was stepping off the bus that brought me to combat training near fort jackson and that was to get ready to go to afghanistan where i saw that one of the things that kept me safe just as sure as my body armor was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country that was known to keep its word our allies and our adversaries knew it the president has torn that to shreds and so the first thing we ve got to do is restore the credibility of the united states applause the second thing we ve got to do is make sure that we not only have the intelligence capabilities and i guess i disagree with the mayor i don t think we need to have ground troops anywhere terrorists can gather because terrorists can gather anywhere in the world but we do need intelligence capabilities and specialists on the ground but what good is that if you have a president who won t listen to them right now some of the biggest threats that we face are not only things like counter terrorism but issues like global health security and the coronavirus that rely on the ability to listen to scientists king time mr mayor buttigieg listen to your own intelligence and coordinate with an international community that this president has alienated because his idea of a security strategy is a big wall king i know it goes fast applause but a minute fifteen is really a long time laughter so we d ask respectfully if you would all please try to keep to the time biden good idea king senator klobuchar good idea right mr vice president senator klobuchar today as we were coming over here today laughter i promise mr vice president we are going to get to you today i promise biden you keep promising me that but you haven t done it yet king i ve never broken a promise biden well let s get to it king senator klobuchar klobuchar why don t you let me answer ok king there was breaking news from the cdc about the coronavirus and so far there have been 2 700 deaths globally and so far in this country there have been no deaths but the cdc says this it s not a matter of if the virus will spread here but when the question to you is this would you close the borders to americans who have been exposed to the coronavirus in order to prevent an outbreak here in this country klobuchar well what we have to do is make sure that we have treatment for those americans and that they are in a quarantine situation we don t want to expose people but we want to give them help and i would agree when mayor bloomberg said that this president has not invested like he should have in his budget he tried to cut back on the cdc he tried to cut back on the international organization that would coordinate with the rest of the world he hasn t yet really addressed the nation on this topic i would do all of that but i want to take this out of politics right now and talk to the american people because this is so serious i m not going to give my website right now i m going to give the cdc s website which is cdc gov so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their health care provider because many doctors are saying it s just a matter of time before we re going to start seeing this here and i think the answers as president what would i do i would better coordinate throughout my presidency to be ready for the next pandemic and to prepare for this one king thank you senator klobuchar i would have better relations with our allies and i would support because i know the vaccine is out there in the head of some kid right now in school in columbia south carolina or houston texas and it s investing in education so we are ready to lead again in the world o donnell senator thank you applause mr vice president we reached a turning point today with the cdc warning schools that they must prepare that they might have to close members of the trump administration saying we don t have enough medical masks if necessary what would you do biden what we did with ebola i was part of making sure that pandemic did not get to the united states saved millions of lives and what we did we set up i helped set up that office in the presidency in the president s office on on diseases that are pandemic diseases we increased the budget of the cdc we increased the nih budget we should and our president today and he s wiped all that out we did it we stopped it and the second thing i d point out to you is that what i would do immediately is restore the funding he cut the funding for cdc he tried to cut the funding for nih he cut the funding for the entire effort and here s the deal i would be on the phone with china and making it clear we are going to need to be in your country you have to be open you have to be clear we have to know what s going on we have to be there with you and insist on it and insist insist insist o donnell thank you biden i could get that done no one up here has ever dealt internationally with any of these world leaders i m the only one that has o donnell senator sanders applause sanders in the white house today in the white house today we have a self described great genius self described and this great genius has told us that this coronavirus is going to end in two months april is the magical day that this great scientist we have in the white house has determined i wish i was kidding that is what he said what do we have to do whether or not the issue is climate change which is clearly a global crisis requiring international cooperation or infectious diseases like coronavirus requiring international cooperation we have to work and expand the world health organization obviously we have to make sure the cdc the nih our infectious departments are fully funded this is a global problem o donnell thank you sanders we ve got to work with countries all the over the world to solve it o donnell senator we re going to stay on the topic of foreign affairs margaret brennan brennan thank you norah mayor bloomberg you ve said that president xi jinping of china is not a dictator and that he is responsive to his constituents and that the u s must cooperate with beijing how far does that go would you allow chinese firms to build critical u s infrastructure bloomberg no i would not and i think the chinese government has not been open their press the freedom of press does not exist there they their human rights record is abominable and we should make a fuss which we have been doing i suppose but we make no mistake about it we have to deal with china if we re ever going to solve the climate crisis we have to deal with them because our economies are inextricably linked we would be not be able to sell or buy the products that we need and in terms of whether he s a dictator he does serve at the behest of the politboro of their group of people but there s no question he has an enormous amount of power and he but he does play to his constituency you can negotiate with him that s exactly what we have to do make it seem that it s in his interest and in his people s interest to do what we want to do follow the rules particularly no stealing of intellectual property follow the rules in terms of the trade agreements that we have are reciprocal and go equally in both directions brennan thank you mr mayor vice president biden crosstalk vice president biden same question to you would you allow chinese firms to build critical u s infrastructure biden no i would not and i spent more time with xi jinping than any world leader had by the time we left office this is a guy who is doesn t have a democratic with a small d bone in his body this is a guy who is a thug who in fact has a million uighurs in reconstruction camps meaning concentration camps this is a guy who you see what s happening right now in in hong kong and this is a guy who i was able to convince should join the international agreement at the paris agreement because guess what they need to be involved you can cooperate and you can also dictate exactly what they are when in fact they said we re going to set up a no fly zone that you can t fly through our zone he said what do you expect me to do when i was over there i said we re going to fly right through it we flew b 1 bombers through it we ve got to make it clear they must play by the rules brennan thank you mr vice president biden period period period brennan senator warren same question would you allow chinese firms to build infrastructure warren we we have to be able to trust our president because there are a lot of decisions a president makes that you just can t follow every part of that and that s one of the reasons that we need to see any candidate s taxes we know that mayor bloomberg has been doing business with china for a long time and he is the only one on this stage who has not released his taxes he plans to release them after super tuesday it is not enough to be able to say just trust me on this we have a president who said he was going to release his taxes after the election and has refused to do this brennan was that a yes or no warren no i would not brennan ok mayor bloomberg would you like to respond bloomberg i got into this race only 10 or 12 weeks ago we have been working on our tax returns i ve said they will be out we probably have another couple of weeks left to go we re doing it as fast we can we ve complied with every single requirement for disclosure and when i was mayor of new york we had our tax returns out twelve years in a row and we will do that in the white house warren no actually crosstalk buttigieg my tax return is online light now crosstalk brennan mr steyer steyer i released my tax returns warren yes steyer that was easy to do but i want to say something about foreign policy biden how many years steyer ten years i want to say something about foreign policy which is this we keep acting as if we re in the 20th century or the 19th century if you look at the biggest threats to the united states we re talking right now about coronavirus that cannot be solved within the borders of the united states we re talking about climate change which is a global problem where we need u s leadership for countries around the world in fact mr trump s policy of us going it alone of america first of having no values no allies and no strategy is disastrous for us the biggest threat to america right now in terms of our safety of our citizens is climate and it s time for us to deal with it that way every single foreign policy issue is about american leadership and coalition brennan new topic senator sanders sanders can i say one word on brennan you praised it s in the same theme sir you ve praised the chinese communist party for lifting more people out of extreme poverty than any other country you also have a track record of expressing sympathy for socialist governments in cuba and in nicaragua can americans trust that a democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass sanders i have opposed authoritarianism all over the world and i was really amazed at what mayor bloomberg just said a moment ago he said that the chinese government is responsive to the politburo but who the hell is the politburo responsive to who elects the politburo you have got a real dictatorship there of course you have a dictatorship in cuba what i said is what barack obama said in terms of cuba that cuba made progress on education yes i think booing sanders really really literacy programs are bad buttigieg yes because there s no comparing those two commentaries ph sanders what barack obama said is they made great progress on education and health care that was barack obama occasionally biden i talked to barack obama sanders excuse me occasionally it might be a good idea to be honest about american foreign policy and that includes the fact that america has overthrown governments all over the world in chile in guatemala in iran and when dictatorships whether it is the chinese or the cubans do something good you acknowledge that but you don t have to trade love letters with them crosstalk brennan mr vice president biden barack obama was abroad he was in a town meeting he did not in any way suggest that there was anything positive about the cuban government he acknowledged that they did increase life expectancy but he went on and condemned the dictatorship he went on and condemned the people who in fact had run that committee he also made sure to make it clear and by the way i called to make sure that i was prepared to i never say inaudible my private conversations with him but the fact of the matter is he in fact does not did not has never embraced an authoritarian regime and does not now applause biden this man said that in fact he thought it was he did not condemn what they did sanders that is untrue categorically untrue biden what did you tell them sanders i have condemned authoritarianism whether it is the people in saudi arabia that the united states government biden how about cuba or nicaragua sanders has loved for years cuba nicaragua authoritarianism of any stripe is bad biden period sanders but that is different than saying that governments occasionally do things that are good that s what barack obama said crosstalk klobuchar margaret margaret could i buttigieg the only way we re going to restore brennan mayor buttigieg buttigieg american credibility the only way you can do this is to actually win the presidency and i am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to donald trump with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s and bernie sanders with a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s applause booing buttigieg this is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or 80s this is about the future this is about 2020 we are not going to survive or succeed and we re certainly not going to win by reliving the cold war and we re not going to win these critical critical house and senate races if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the democratic party is telling people to look at the bright side of the castro regime we ve got to be a lot smarter about this and look to the future applause booing brennan senator sanders your response sanders let us be clear do we think health care for all pete is some kind of radical communist idea crosstalk buttigieg well you brought this up let s talk about that crosstalk sanders do we think raising the minimum wage to a living wage crosstalk buttigieg i m happy to respond to the question because this is really important crosstalk sanders do we think building the millions of units of affordable housing that we need crosstalk buttigieg if you re going to ask that rhetorical question let s crosstalk sanders do we think raising taxes on billionaires is a radical idea crosstalk buttigieg let s talk about this let s talk about what s radical about that plan crosstalk sanders do you think criminal justice reform is a radical idea crosstalk buttigieg the things you just named are things crosstalk sanders do you think immigration reform the truth is pete crosstalk brennan one at a time crosstalk sanders the american people support my agenda crosstalk buttigieg the way you re talking about doing it is radical by crosstalk sanders that is why i am beating trump in virtually every poll that is done and why i will defeat him crosstalk buttigieg we ve got to open this up universal health care for example brennan senator klobuchar crosstalk klobuchar donald trump s worst nightmare is having someone that the people in the middle who are tired of the insults and the extremes in our politics have someone to vote for and i was going to comment on cuba policy because i actually lead the bill to lift the embargo i went with barack obama when he went to cuba and i ve seen firsthand how the cuban are way in front of our their leaders they like america they want to be entrepreneurs and the way that we embrace them and not the socialist regime is by opening up cuba and starting to do business with them but to get at what we were just talking about i just think we have a huge choice super tuesday states one third of america will vote do you want to have someone brennan thank you senator klobuchar in charge of this ticket could i finish margaret brennan well you re out of time senator klobuchar you want to have someone in charge of this ticket who wants to put forward 60 trillion in spending three times the american economy brennan bill whitaker klobuchar i don t think we do i think that we can get all those bold progressive things done without having someone that is so alienating that we re going to turn off the voters that we need to bring with us crosstalk brennan you have to allow the senator to respond senator sanders buttigieg i want to respond to the question that senator sanders sanders can i respond amy used the word alienating hey amy my favorability nationally i believe are the highest up here as a matter of fact applause sanders all right but the point is the point is the way we are going to beat trump which is what everybody up here wants is we need a campaign of energy and excitement we need to have the largest voter turnout in the history of the united states we need to bring working people back in to the democratic party we need to get young people voting in a way they have never done before that is what our campaign is about applause brennan bill whitaker has the floor whitaker vice president biden biden yes whitaker the bipartisan senate select committee on intelligence report concluded russia interfered in our last presidential election and the obama administration failed to respond forcefully u s intelligence says russia is at it again if it is proven that russia has interfered in the 2020 elections would you as president launch a retaliatory cyber attack biden i would make them pay for it and i would make them pay for it economically they are engaged now as i speak in interfering in our elections they were engaged and when we when in fact we were the last election in 2016 against hillary they were there s no question this man stood before the whole world turned to the russian leader and said why in god s name would this man ever interfere in our elections give me a break seventeen intelligence agencies said he did when we got the information we went to the committee in the senate that s responsible for knowing these issues and dealing with them we went to mitch mcconnell and said join us and point out what is happening here he said no we want no part of it and if we had moved we didn t have all the information at that time until after the election was over and so the idea the bipartisan committee said we could have done more theoretically that s true but the fact of the matter is we didn t have the information until the end and so look we in fact should be imposing sanctions on russia now for their interference applause whitaker mr steyer steyer look 21st century warfare is cyber warfare what we re having is an attack by a hostile foreign power on our democracy right now the question you have to ask is where is the commander in chief and let me say this biden we don t have one steyer this isn t news what vice president biden said is true he did stand next to vladimir putin there was a hostile foreign attack on our election last time and the president sided with the hostile foreign power that s why i started need to impeach that s what we have to do we have to oppose a president who sides with a hostile foreign power that commits cyber warfare against the united states of america that s where we are where are all these patriotic republicans who wave the flag but when we re actually under attack they side with our enemies it s outrageous applause that s why he should have been impeached they covered it up and i was years before these people there s something wrong here we re under attack and they re not doing a darn thing about it garrett thank you mr steyer buttigieg look the way to deter a cyber attack garrett senator sanders no senator sanders i have a question for you sir you re the frontrunner in this race you re on the ballot in south carolina mayor bloomberg you ll understand that preamble in just a second if elected senator sanders you would be america s first jewish president you recently called a very prominent well known american israel lobby a platform for quote bigotry what would you say to american jews who might be concerned you re not from their perspective supportive enough of israel and specifically sir would you move the u s embassy back to tel aviv sanders let me just the answer is it s something that we would take into consideration garrett which would sanders but here excuse me but here is the point i am very proud of being jewish i actually lived in israel for some months but what i happen to believe is that right now sadly tragically in israel through bibi netanyahu you have a reactionary racist who is now running that country applause and i happen to believe i happen to believe that what our foreign policy in the mideast should be about is absolutely protecting the independence and security of israel but you cannot ignore the suffering of the palestinian people applause we have got to have a policy that reaches out to the palestinians and the americans and in answer to your question that will come within the context of bringing nations together in the mideast garrett mayor bloomberg would you like to weigh in on that please bloomberg well the battle has been going on for a long time in the middle east whether it s the arabs versus the persians the shias versus the sunnis the jews in israel and the palestinians it s only gone on for 40 or 50 years number one you can t move the embassy back we should not have done it without getting something from the israeli government but it was done and you re going to have to leave it there number two only solution here is a two state solution the palestinians have to be accommodated the real problem here is you have two groups of people both who think god gave them the same piece of land and the answer is to obviously split it up leave the israeli borders where they are try to push them to pull back some of those extra over the on the other side of the wall where they ve built these new communities which they should not have done that pull it back garrett mayor bloomberg thank you very much senator warren warren look the way we have to think about this is i think we have to start with the values and what has to be protected here israelis have a right to security and the palestinians have a right to be treated with dignity and to have self determination that is a two state solution but it s not up to us to determine what the terms of a two state solution are we want to be a good ally to everyone in the region the best way to do that is to encourage the parties to get to the negotiating table themselves donald trump s big mistake is he keeps putting a thumb on the scale on just one side and that moves the parties further away from working out their own solution here we need to be an ally by supporting them to come to negotiate to find a lasting peace garrett but senator warren just on the question of the embassy what was your position on that warren it is not ours to do garrett would you move it back warren it is not ours to do we should let the parties determine the capital garrett would you move it back or not yes or no klobuchar it s our embassy warren we should let the parties determine the capitals themselves garrett norah o donnell i want to turn now to the issue of north korea because president trump has engaged in direct diplomacy meeting directly with kim jong un senator klobuchar if you were commander in chief would you meet with the north korean leader klobuchar i would but not in the way this president has done it he literally thinks he can go over and bring a hot dish to the dictator next door and he thinks everything s going to be fine he has not done it with our allies he has literally just hastily called summits and run off that is no way to do it and as you can see north korea is emboldened they re still launching missiles they ve promised a christmas surprise that thankfully never happened and he has not been able to advance the ball at all so what would i do i would work with our allies and as has been pointed out this is what this president fails at all the time we should be negotiating ourselves back into the iran nuclear agreement we should be working with russia not only to stand up for the protection of our elections and call vladimir putin out for what he is the ruthless dictator that takes down planes that poisons dissidents but that also at the same time we have to acknowledge that we should be renegotiating the new start treaty and the other arms negotiations that must happen this president just likes to do tweets at 4 00 a m in his bathrobe gets out there and doesn t achieve the results we need i would meet with him but i would do it with our allies i would have clear deliverables and i would achieve those deliverables o donnell senator klobuchar thank you applause mr vice president how would you deal with north korea biden you don t negotiate with a dictator give him legitimacy without any notion whether he is going to do anything at all you don t do that look what happened he gave this dictator he s a thug legitimacy we ve weakened the sanctions around the world against holding us committing people not to trade if anything from oil to parts that can deal with providing missile technology and what s happened it s been weakened i would be in beijing i would be calling to i would be speaking with xi jinping i would be reassigning the relationship between the japan and south korea and i would make it clear i would make it clear to china we are going to continue to move closer to make sure that we can in fact prevent china prevent north korea from launching missiles to take them down o donnell ok biden and if we don t why am i stopping no one else stops applause o donnell ok ok sir biden it s my catholic school training applause o donnell ok king vice president biden you re a gentleman good home training thank you sir biden yeah gentlemen don t get very well treated up here o donnell margaret brennan brennan thank you very much norah this is a question for mayor buttigieg as you know viewers and voters are participating in this through twitter the city of idlib in syria is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis the syrian regime and russia are targeting schools bakeries and hospitals what would you do as president to push back regime and russian forces and stop the killing of innocent civilians buttigieg well first of all i stand with the people of idlib who are being targeted as you said in a brutal fashion by a dictatorship that has already been so brutal for so many years and this is one of the reasons we have got to change the balance of power in the region because the president has basically vanished from the stage when it comes to even playing a role in the future there turkey russia iran all have so much more of a say than we do we don t have to be invading countries to be making a difference working with our international partners in order to deliver peace and support those who are standing up for self determination now i want to come back to something and i promise it relates to international affairs because senator sanders asked me a question earlier he asked the question of whether health care for everybody is a radical idea and it s not which is why i m for it very much in a different way though what is a radical idea is completely eliminating all private insurance and part of how you know it is is that no industrialized country has gone that far he and i both like to talk about denmark for example but even in denmark they have not abolished the possibility of private insurance so this is an idea that goes further than what is acceptable in denmark the country let alone imagining how that s going to fly in denmark south carolina brennan thank you mayor sanders can i respond brennan senator warren would you like to respond what would do what would senator warren do to stop the mass murder warren i m sorry brennan what would same question what would you do to stop the mass murder in idlib syria warren look i think that what we ve got to do is we have to provide humanitarian relief we need to work with our allies on this but this is not a moment for military intervention we have got to use our military only when we see a military problem that can be solved militarily we cannot send our military in unless we have a plan to get them out so for me this is about working with our allies it is about standing with the people who are under enormous pressure right now this is recognizing what donald trump has put us in in a terrible box around the world but the solution is not to use our military the solution is to use the other tools here brennan thank you senator gayle king we ve talked a lot about your policies during this debate now we d like to get a little more personal i know senator sanders how much you enjoy that we re going to ask you when we come back from the break about the words you live by we re going to give you a couple of minutes to gather your thoughts and we ll be right back applause o donnell welcome back to charleston south carolina this is the final segment of the final debate before the first in the south primary this saturday and super tuesday one week from today gayle king all right one final question candidates and it is a two parter first i d like you each to tell us your the biggest misconception about you that s number one number two the south carolina motto is this while i breathe i hope so outside of politics in no more than 45 seconds or so what is your personal motto your personal belief your favorite quote that represents you mr steyer the biggest misconception and then your motto steyer the biggest misconception about me is that somehow i m defined by business success and money king ok and your motto steyer my motto every day i write a cross on my hand to remind myself to tell the truth and do what s right no matter what king all right applause thank you mr steyer senator klobuchar klobuchar i d say the biggest unknown inaudible klobuchar the biggest misconception is that i m boring because i m not laughter then i would say that my motto is the words of one of my political mentors paul wellstone who sadly is no longer with us and he said that politics is about improving people s lives and that s been my life from when my grandpa was an iron ore miner in the unions politics made those mines safer and when my dad needed treatment it was there for him and in his words he was pursued by grace and when my mom got divorced and she didn t have a job and she went back to teaching and that gift of public service got her through and then when our daughter was born and she couldn t swallow king senator klobuchar what was your motto i m sorry senator klobuchar what was your motto klobuchar oh i thought we had a minute to answer the question king no what was your motto i m sorry klobuchar my motto was that politics is about improving people s lives king got it got it klobuchar yes king vice president biden biggest misconception klobuchar it was a pretty good one king it was a very good one very good one laughter klobuchar thank you thank you biden when you get knocked down get up and everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity no matter what no matter who they are my also that everyone should be represented everyone and no one s better than me and i m no better than anyone else the fact is what we should be doing we talked about the supreme court i m looking forward to making sure there s a black woman on the supreme court to make sure we in fact get every representation applause not a joke not a joke i pushed very hard for that king vice president biden and my mother s motto was she said you know you re defined by your courage you re redeemed by your loyalty i am loyal i do what i say king what s the biggest misconception about you sir biden i have more hair than i think i do laughter king there s a way to fix that senator sanders sanders misconception king yes sanders misconception and you re hearing it here tonight is that the ideas i m talking about are radical they re not in one form or another they exist in countries all over the world health care is a human right we have the necessity the moral imperative to address the existential threat of climate change other countries are doing that we don t need more people in jail disproportionately african american than any other country on earth not a radical idea the motto the saying that that moves me the most is from nelson mandela and mandela said everything is impossible until it happens applause and that means if we have the guts to stand up to powerful special interests who are doing phenomenally well if we can bring working people together black and white and latino we can create a nation king all right senator sanders where all people have a good standard of living king senator thanks you sir senator warren applause warren well i suppose one misconception is that i don t eat very much in fact i eat all the time laughter because i get teased about this look i never was supposed to be on a stage like this and the misconception is that i thought i should be president of the united states no i got into this because i am a fighter my motto ties in directly to this it s mathew 25 and that is inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these the least of thy brethren ye have done it unto me for me this is about how we treat other people and how we lift them up that is why i am in this fight that is why i am running to be president and it is why i will be an effective president applause o donnell thank you senator now buttigieg buttigieg well i think the biggest conception misconception is that i m not passionate i get that i m kind of level some say unflappable i don t think you want a president who is flappable but it s precisely because i m so passionate about the things that are going on in this country that i consider it important to approach all of that with discipline and my disciplines are guided by the mottoes i try to live by many of which come from scripture and just to be clear i would never impose my interpretation of my religion to anybody just as sure as i m wearing this ring i ll never let that happen to anybody but i seek to live by the teachings that say if you would be a leader you must first be a servant and of course the teaching not unique to the christian tradition but a big part of it that holds that we are to treat others as we would be treated and when i think about everything at stake from racial and economic justice to our stewardship of the climate to the need to heal the sick and the need to heal this country i seek for those teachings to order my steps as i go through this campaign and as i go through life applause o donnell thank you mayor bloomberg bloomberg misconception that i m six feet tall laughter bloomberg and quote i ve trained for this job for a long time and when i get it i m going to do something rather than just talk about it applause king all right thank you candidates thank you very much o donnell well thank you that concludes our debate king no no we have time for one more break norah one
