marco rubio s 2016 campaign team wants to make one thing very clear they don t buy the new polling numbers from quinnipiac university that show him atop the republican presidential field polls in 10 mos out don t matter rt learyreports new q poll shows rubio leading gop field and clinton http t co is99mxzfin and they shouldn t as our own philip bump notes rubio s bump in the poll tracks with the upward momentum of other republicans when they have made their own candidacies official what the numbers tell you about rubio is that he had a nicely executed campaign launch and that at least initially people are interested in buying what he s selling but for all of the this means nothing ness coming from the rubio campaign i would argue that this poll does tell us or at least reminds us of two very important things 1 the 2016 republican primary is among the most wide open and fluid in modern memory 2 jeb bush is not the frontrunner all you need to do is look a bit more deeply into the q numbers to understand those points first off notice that seven candidates get somewhere between seven and 15 percent of the vote second note that 14 percent of those asked to choose a candidate opted for don t know a somewhat amazing finding given the massive number of candidates running the q poll tested 14 candidates the actual field will likely be significantly larger now check out the results over time in q polling so rubio s support tripled from last month to this one more importantly scott walker s support tripled from a november poll to one quinnipiac did in early march then dropped seven points in this latest survey why because people have no idea who they want to be for just yet most people up to and including those who will definitely vote next year in the republican caucuses and primaries just aren t paying close attention to the happenings on the campaign trail yet when rubio s name pops up more often due to his announcement they dial in briefly like what they see and then return back to not paying attention of course if someone calls them and asks who they like the positive and last impression they have is of rubio hence the bump now go back to that first chart above and zero in on bush s numbers bush s strongest performing subgroup he gets 20 percent among them is moderate liberal republicans among very conservative voters 8percent and those who align with the tea party 4percent bush fares far less well that s troubling for bush since very conservative and tea party voters tend to be the ones who turn out in the early days of these nomination fights and as a result often play an outsized role in picking the nominee it s also worth noting in regards to bush that a look back at the last three q polls suggests an electorate looking to vote for someone other than him back in november that person was mitt romney who led the way with 19 percent by march romney was out but walker not bush appeared to be the major beneficiary of that absence now rubio rises even as bush stays where he has roughly always been it s hard to justify calling someone a frontrunner who not only doesn t lead in most national polling but also fails to break 16 percent in a trio of polls conducted over the past six months or so why is this such good news for rubio because as i ve noted before he is the most naturally talented candidate in the field read this david brooks column about him if lots of voters haven t made up their minds for say bush or walker that leaves rubio a big opportunity to win them over the more fluid the field the better it is for candidates whohave the combination of relatively low name id and high upside in terms of raw campaign talent that s rubio
