has abandoned all hope of rescuing his candidacy by michael kruse september 10 2019 michael kruse is a senior staff writer for politico boston beto o rourke last week stopped here for beers he wasn t hunting big dollar donors or votes in a state with a meaningful primary he instead wanted to stand on a box in the middle of a pub and just let it rip so that s what he did the crowd was young diverse and notably not reaching to write checks but it was plenty ready to hear his profane riff on his proposed gun buybacks he downed a ricochet ipa while answering questions and then took his place in the picture line and ordered another beer two women joined him in raising their pints salud he said for a onetime democratic darling who hasn t sniffed double digits in the polls of his party s presidential candidates for months this brewery called backlash didn t seem like a materially strategic smart spot to be in the run up to a debate night that might for him be do or die but o rourke s not doing the obvious anymore advertisement in the wake of august 3 when a bigot with an ak 47 style assault rifle murdered 22 people in a walmart in o rourke s hometown of el paso texas the former congressman changed the way he s waging his presidential campaign he s running with arguably reckless abandon breaking norms to try to rekindle some lost spark beyond his much discussed uptick in swearing he has traveled to places that make limited political sense taken a provocative proposal on assault rifles that could permanently jeopardize his electoral viability in his native state and he has trashed president donald trump with increasingly explicit rhetoric what s interesting about o rourke at this moment is not just that he s saying fuck a whole bunch he s always dropped curse words on the stump but that he s entered more broadly a new phase of his 2020 bid which supporters find inspiring and critics consider desperate to the point of pathetic up close though it feels pretty compelling let s go ahead and call it beto s fuck it phase that s where i think he s at now moses mercado a democratic lobbyist from texas told me he s like ok well screw it eff it austin texas based republican strategist brendan steinhauser said he has no fucks to give added jay surdukowski an attorney and activist who is one of o rourke s most devoted backers in new hampshire this feels right to me o rourke told reporters by the fermentation tanks at backlash after i asked him about how he s campaigning he said this is the way politics should be the question lurking behind this caution free style is whether o rourke is doing this because he cares less about his stagnant candidacy or because he in fact cares so much more six months ago o rourke was drawn into this race it seemed because of some combination of a sense of entitlement born to be in it along with an irresistible inertia he did after all bring in a record breaking 80 million in his bid to unseat the unlovable ted cruz after the lengthy will he or won t he the middle of america meandering and his overwrought postings on medium his entrance prompted a frenzy of live coverage attention on cable news reality bit alas and right out of the gate was as good as it got his fundraising dipped precipitously after his considerable initial intake the mayor of the fourth largest city in indiana swiped his new guy next gen fizz he turned in oddly leaden showings in the first couple debates and languished in a polling position unbudgingly far behind the clear top three and trailing even out of nowhere entrepreneur andrew yang then though came the shooting o rourke hurried home he stayed in el paso for almost two weeks he listened and gave hugs and attended vigils and silently marched he called trump a white supremacist he called him the greatest threat to this country he couldn t fathom he would say leaving to go for the comparatively inconsequential corn dogs and ferris wheels of the iowa state fair anxious angry and rattled he was asked by a reporter if there were anything trump could do to make this any better he answered with a kind of righteous despair that sounded new but it boiled down to this what the fuck by the time he was ready to return to the trail he did so by saying he could see more clearly that there is a way to do this better and that one of those ways is to not simply retrace well trodden politically prudent early voting state paths he went to mississippi to try to shine a spotlight on the recent raids by u s immigration and customs enforcement he went to a gun show in arkansas he went to oklahoma to go to the 1995 bombing memorial and the site of a 1921 race riot and talked about white nationalism and domestic terrorism even at pit stops in more expected locales o rourke acted in ways that were suddenly strikingly even dangerously unstandard at historically black benedict college in south carolina for instance his campaign booted a reporter from far right breitbart news beto o rourke has transformed from a moderate congressman to a liberal hero see where he stands on all the issues it was in some ways reminiscent of his run against cruz in which he hit every one of the 254 counties in texas even the reddest of the red all part of an effort that was not just diy but to a fatal fault some said ditwhw do it the way he wanted and in a rural trump loving portion of virginia after yet another mass shooting in west texas he said it was fucked up and he said it live on cnn and made his stance on these kinds of guns even more blunt how he was asked by a reporter would he reassure owners of assault rifles that the government wasn t coming to take their guns i want to be really clear o rourke answered that s exactly what we re going to do just in case that wasn t enough his campaign manager added in a tweet get every one of those goddamn guns off our streets shortly thereafter the campaign leaned in harder hawking shirts that say this is f cked up not once not twice but six times stacked with this o rourke broke some glass as buzzfeed s ben smith wrote in his newsletter in the minds though of some texas political strategists republicans and democrats alike he did more than that he might have killed his career they told me those words will come back to destroy him should he run for statewide office again said longtime democratic strategist hank sheinkopf who s worked on campaigns all over the country to say we will take away your guns you know in this state in this culture that s a no no steinhauser said his presidential bid said matt mackowiak a gop strategist in austin has been very bad for his future in politics in texas last week though he was in new york for cnn s climate change town hall and from there he took the budget bolt bus to boston in the raw aftermath of the shooting in el paso the performance the ritual all the editing that goes into speaking when you re running for office he said during the ride just really evaporated or didn t seem important or i didn t even really know that i cared at that point he described the question that elicited his most memorable response the stupidest fucking question i ve ever been asked he described himself as pissed at the world o rourke s long been a slinger of four letter salt when making his political pitch but this new level has been hard to the point of impossible to ignore and now at backlash which endeavors to brew in defiance he harangued trump and the crazy shit he says he decried the suggestion that four black and brown women who are members of congress should go back to anywhere that isn t the united states of america tell me what the fuck that means he said and he lamented the prevalence of weapons that were built for war and meant to shred your insides to shit this is fucked up called out chris wright 39 a square jawed flat topped food distributor from nearby scituate wearing a blue beto por texas t shirt o rourke heard him and looked at him this is fucked up some see this as glorified performance art a caricature of authenticity but it s working for wright beto s not afraid to say things he said he s not afraid to say it like it is for those people that say oh trump says it like it is well guess what let s go head to head will it work for not only wright but many more persuadable voters the swearing the going anywhere and everywhere the talk of making people give up their prized but deadly guns that of course is tbd no sign so far in the polls politicos from both parties are not optimistic he s seeking ways to bring the fire back sheinkopf said too late he s almost become a target for mockery steinhauser added i don t know what he does after this i don t think he s going to run for congress again i think if he were to run for senate the editorial board of the houston chronicle recently pleaded for him to drop out of the presidential race and come home and challenge john cornyn i don t think he would just walk into the democratic nomination i think he s been that damaged after his stop in massachusetts he continued on up to new hampshire where he rejoined the rest of the still massive field of 2020 dems and did a town hall in keene he took off his shoes to go into a mosque to tell the people gathered that trump is the most dangerous president the united states has ever had he ate indonesian rice pudding at a festival in somersworth and complimented the vendors on it and at the state party s convention at the downtown arena in manchester wearing a white shirt with no tie and a navy suit with no belt he delivered a speech in which he said trump had no honor no morals and no ethics talking to reporters in a cramped stuffy room off the floor he discussed climate change if we can t make progress on climate change he said then people are going to give up on their government they re going to say you know what this shit does not work he was asked on his way out if he was going to swear thursday night on the debate stage in houston he responded with a verbal shrug of the shoulders maybe lot of talk of late of your use of the word fuck i told o rourke a few hours later when i caught up to him in the early evening at the university of new hampshire in durham where he spoke to perhaps a hundred students i m not interested so much in that but i am interested in the idea that you ve sort of entered this like fuck it phase of your campaign i wondered if that were an accurate read yeah he said i am trying my best to be as honest and direct as possible and when asked a question or thinking through a given issue to make sure that it is as candid a response as i can possibly produce in part because i think i realize that our rhetoric our politics the scripts we as politicians the talking points we as politicians have been using have been completely insufficient to the challenges that we face he said the demands that we have in this country i think necessitate you know a different kind of politics and a much more honest transparent way of discussing these issues he exited through a side door he needed to get some rest he was slated to make another unusual campaign
