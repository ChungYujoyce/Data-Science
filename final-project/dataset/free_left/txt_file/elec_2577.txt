policy adviser to the trump campaign made a startling revelation to australia s top diplomat in britain russia had political dirt on hillary clinton about three weeks earlier mr papadopoulos had been told that moscow had thousands of emails that would embarrass mrs clinton apparently stolen in an effort to try to damage her campaign exactly how much mr papadopoulos said that night at the kensington wine rooms with the australian alexander downer is unclear but two months later when leaked democratic emails began appearing online australian officials passed the information about mr papadopoulos to their american counterparts according to four current and former american and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the australians role the hacking and the revelation that a member of the trump campaign may have had inside information about it were driving factors that led the f b i to open an investigation in july 2016 into russia s attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of president trump s associates conspired if mr papadopoulos who pleaded guilty to lying to the f b i and is now a cooperating witness was the improbable match that set off a blaze that has consumed the first year of the trump administration his saga is also a tale of the trump campaign in miniature he was brash boastful and underqualified yet he exceeded expectations and like the campaign itself he proved to be a tantalizing target for a russian influence operation while some of mr trump s advisers have derided him as an insignificant campaign volunteer or a coffee boy interviews and new documents show that he stayed influential throughout the campaign two months before the election for instance he helped arrange a new york meeting between mr trump and president abdel fattah el sisi of egypt the information that mr papadopoulos gave to the australians answers one of the lingering mysteries of the past year what so alarmed american officials to provoke the f b i to open a counterintelligence investigation into the trump campaign months before the presidential election it was not as mr trump and other politicians have alleged a dossier compiled by a former british spy hired by a rival campaign instead it was firsthand information from one of america s closest intelligence allies interviews and previously undisclosed documents show that mr papadopoulos played a critical role in this drama and reveal a russian operation that was more aggressive and widespread than previously known they add to an emerging portrait gradually filled in over the past year in revelations by federal investigators journalists and lawmakers of russians with government contacts trying to establish secret channels at various levels of the trump campaign the f b i investigation which was taken over seven months ago by the special counsel robert s mueller iii has cast a shadow over mr trump s first year in office even as he and his aides repeatedly played down the russian efforts and falsely denied campaign contacts with russians they have also insisted that mr papadopoulos was a low level figure but spies frequently target peripheral players as a way to gain insight and leverage f b i officials disagreed in 2016 about how aggressively and publicly to pursue the russia inquiry before the election but there was little debate about what seemed to be afoot john o brennan who retired this year after four years as c i a director told congress in may that he had been concerned about multiple contacts between russian officials and trump advisers russia he said had tried to suborn members of the trump campaign mr papadopoulos then an ambitious 28 year old from chicago was working as an energy consultant in london when the trump campaign desperate to create a foreign policy team named him as an adviser in early march 2016 his political experience was limited to two months on ben carson s presidential campaign before it collapsed mr papadopoulos had no experience on russia issues but during his job interview with sam clovis a top early campaign aide he saw an opening he was told that improving relations with russia was one of mr trump s top foreign policy goals according to court papers an account mr clovis has denied traveling in italy that march mr papadopoulos met joseph mifsud a maltese professor at a now defunct london academy who had valuable contacts with the russian ministry of foreign affairs mr mifsud showed little interest in mr papadopoulos at first but when he found out he was a trump campaign adviser he latched onto him according to court records and emails obtained by the new york times their joint goal was to arrange a meeting between mr trump and president vladimir v putin of russia in moscow or between their respective aides in response to questions mr papadopoulos s lawyers declined to provide a statement before the end of the month mr mifsud had arranged a meeting at a london cafe between mr papadopoulos and olga polonskaya a young woman from st petersburg whom he falsely described as mr putin s niece although ms polonskaya told the times in a text message that her english skills are poor her emails to mr papadopoulos were largely fluent we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with mr trump ms polonskaya wrote in one message more important mr mifsud connected mr papadopoulos to ivan timofeev a program director for the prestigious valdai discussion club a gathering of academics that meets annually with mr putin the two men corresponded for months about how to connect the russian government and the campaign records suggest that mr timofeev who has been described by mr mueller s team as an intermediary for the russian foreign ministry discussed the matter with the ministry s former leader igor s ivanov who is widely viewed in the united states as one of russia s elder statesmen when mr trump s foreign policy team gathered for the first time at the end of march in washington mr papadopoulos said he had the contacts to set up a meeting between mr trump and mr putin mr trump listened intently but apparently deferred to jeff sessions then a senator from alabama and head of the campaign s foreign policy team according to participants in the meeting mr sessions now the attorney general initially did not reveal that discussion to congress because he has said he did not recall it more recently he said he pushed back against mr papadopoulos s proposal at least partly because he did not want someone so unqualified to represent the campaign on such a sensitive matter if the campaign wanted mr papadopoulos to stand down previously undisclosed emails obtained by the times show that he either did not get the message or failed to heed it he continued for months to try to arrange some kind of meeting with russian representatives keeping senior campaign advisers abreast of his efforts mr clovis ultimately encouraged him and another foreign policy adviser to travel to moscow but neither went because the campaign would not cover the cost mr papadopoulos was trusted enough to edit the outline of mr trump s first major foreign policy speech on april 27 an address in which the candidate said it was possible to improve relations with russia mr papadopoulos flagged the speech to his newfound russia contacts telling mr timofeev that it should be taken as the signal to meet that is a statesman speech mr mifsud agreed ms polonskaya wrote that she was pleased that mr trump s position toward russia is much softer than that of other candidates stephen miller then a senior policy adviser to the campaign and now a top white house aide was eager for mr papadopoulos to serve as a surrogate someone who could publicize mr trump s foreign policy views without officially speaking for the campaign but mr papadopoulos s first public attempt to do so was a disaster in a may 4 2016 interview with the times of london mr papadopoulos called on prime minister david cameron to apologize to mr trump for criticizing his remarks on muslims as stupid and divisive say sorry to trump or risk special relationship cameron told the headline read mr clovis the national campaign co chairman severely reprimanded mr papadopoulos for failing to clear his explosive comments with the campaign in advance from then on mr papadopoulos was more careful with the press though he never regained the full trust of mr clovis or several other campaign officials mr mifsud proposed to mr papadopoulos that he too serve as a campaign surrogate he could write op eds under the guise of a neutral observer he wrote in a previously undisclosed email and follow mr trump to his rallies as an accredited journalist while receiving briefings from the inside the campaign in late april at a london hotel mr mifsud told mr papadopoulos that he had just learned from high level russian officials in moscow that the russians had dirt on mrs clinton in the form of thousands of emails according to court documents although russian hackers had been mining data from the democratic national committee s computers for months that information was not yet public even the committee itself did not know whether mr papadopoulos shared that information with anyone else in the campaign is one of many unanswered questions he was mostly in contact with the campaign over emails the day after mr mifsud s revelation about the hacked emails he told mr miller in an email only that he had interesting messages coming in from moscow about a possible trip the emails obtained by the times show no evidence that mr papadopoulos discussed the stolen messages with the campaign not long after however he opened up to mr downer the australian diplomat about his contacts with the russians it is unclear whether mr downer was fishing for that information that night in may 2016 the meeting at the bar came about because of a series of connections beginning with an israeli embassy official who introduced mr papadopoulos to another australian diplomat in london it is also not clear why after getting the information in may the australian government waited two months to pass it to the f b i in a statement the australian embassy in washington declined to provide details about the meeting or confirm that it occurred as a matter of principle and practice the australian government does not comment on matters relevant to active investigations the statement said the f b i declined to comment once the information mr papadopoulos had disclosed to the australian diplomat reached the f b i the bureau opened an investigation that became one of its most closely guarded secrets senior agents did not discuss it at the daily morning briefing a classified setting where officials normally speak freely about highly sensitive operations besides the information from the australians the investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments including the british and dutch a trip to moscow by another adviser carter page also raised concerns at the f b i with so many strands coming in about mr papadopoulos mr page the hackers and more f b i agents debated how aggressively to investigate the campaign s russia ties according to current and former officials familiar with the debate issuing subpoenas or questioning people for example could cause the investigation to burst into public view in the final months of a presidential campaign it could also tip off the russian government which might try to cover its tracks some officials argued against taking such disruptive steps especially since the f b i would not be able to unravel the case before the election others believed that the possibility of a compromised presidential campaign was so serious that it warranted the most thorough aggressive tactics even if the odds against a trump presidency were long these agents argued it was prudent to take every precaution that included questioning christopher steele the former british spy who was compiling the dossier alleging a far ranging russian conspiracy to elect mr trump a team of f b i agents traveled to europe to interview mr steele in early october 2016 mr steele had shown some of his findings to an f b i agent in rome three months earlier but that information was not part of the justification to start an counterintelligence inquiry american officials said ultimately the f b i and justice department decided to keep the investigation quiet a decision that democrats in particular have criticized and agents did not interview mr papadopoulos until late january he was hardly central to the daily running of the trump campaign yet mr papadopoulos continuously found ways to make himself useful to senior trump advisers in september 2016 with the united nations general assembly approaching and stories circulating that mrs clinton was going to meet with mr sisi the egyptian president mr papadopoulos sent a message to stephen k bannon the campaign s chief executive offering to broker a similar meeting for mr trump after days of scheduling discussions the meeting was set and mr papadopoulos sent a list of talking points to mr bannon according to people familiar with those interactions asked about his contacts with mr papadopoulos mr bannon declined to comment mr trump s improbable victory raised mr papadopoulos s hopes that he might ascend to a top white house job the election win also prompted a business proposal from sergei millian a naturalized american citizen born in belarus after he had contacted mr papadopoulos out of the blue over linkedin during the summer of 2016 the two met repeatedly in manhattan mr millian has bragged of his ties to mr trump boasts that the president s advisers have said are overstated he headed an obscure organization called the russian american chamber of commerce some of whose board members and clients are difficult to confirm congress is investigating where he fits into the swirl of contacts with the trump campaign although he has said he is unfairly being scrutinized only because of his support for mr trump mr millian proposed that he and mr papadopoulos form an energy related business that would be financed by russian billionaires who are not under sanctions and would open all doors for us at any level all the way to the top one billionaire he said wanted to explore the idea of opening a trump branded hotel in moscow i know the president will distance himself from business but his children might be interested he wrote nothing came of his proposals partly because mr papadopoulos was hoping that michael t flynn then mr trump s pick to be national security adviser might give him the energy portfolio at the national security council the pair exchanged new year s greetings in the final hours of 2016 happy new year sir mr papadopoulos wrote thank you and same to you george happy new year mr flynn responded ahead of a year that seemed to hold great promise but 2017 did not unfold that way within months mr flynn was fired and both men were charged with lying to the f b i and both became important witnesses in the investigation mr papadopoulos had played a critical role in starting advertisement
