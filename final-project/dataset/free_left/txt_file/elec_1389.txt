advertisement supported by by michael barbaro and steve eder robert guillo gave a glowing evaluation to his instructor at trump university because he said the teacher pleaded for the best possible score warning that without it mr trump might not invite me back to teach again jeffrey tufenkian offered excellent ratings because his trump university assigned mentor refused to leave the room until he did so standing right in front of me as he filled out the evaluation form he said john brown tried to give his trump university teacher a poor review but said he was talked out of it by employees of the program who called him three times hounding him to raise his original scores tired of the continuing phone calls he later testified i finally gave in his dismal marks changed to top scores mr brown said in the sprawling business empire of donald j trump the real estate classes that bore his name seem to occupy a tiny insignificant corner but the controversy and litigation now enveloping them have taken on surprising potency in the republican presidential campaign that he is dominating now as mr trump tries to fend off claims of misleading and fraudulent practices from scores of former students claims his opponents have brought up in debates and in ads his biggest weapon is what appears to be the overwhelmingly positive reviews from past participants a 98 percent level of satisfaction in his telling beautiful statements is how he describes the evaluations but hundreds of pages of legal documents as well as interviews with former students and instructors suggest the surveys themselves were a central component of a business model that according to lawsuits and investigators deceived consumers into handing over thousands of dollars with tantalizing promises of riches interviews and documents show that employees of trump university at times applied pressure on students to offer favorable reviews instructed them to fill out the forms in order to obtain their graduation certificates and ignored standard practices used to ensure that the surveys were filled out objectively it s absolutely a con said mr guillo who spent 36 000 on trump university classes and later requested a refund the role of the evaluations were a defense against any legal actions they anticipated those actions at the same time students and their lawyers have raised doubts about mr trump s claim of 98 percent satisfaction a website set up to defend trump university 98percentapproval com has published 10 000 student evaluations but not all of them were from paying students they include some from the more than 3 000 free guests that paying participants were encouraged to bring to the classes more than 2 000 other students never made it to the end of their courses they sought and received refunds before the end of their classes as company policy allowed according to court records in an interview a lawyer for mr trump daniel m petrocelli said the experience of students who felt manipulated is not representative of what happened across the board folks were not coerced he said of the positive evaluations it s completely implausible to suggest that the 10 000 reviews from the students and their guests were the result of pressure or coercion they gave overwhelmingly positive reviews because they were being honest about their assessment mr trump has vowed to fight the litigation which includes a class action lawsuit in san diego seeking refunds for former trump university students and a lawsuit from the new york attorney general he has said the aggrieved former students are simply looking for easy money after having learned valuable lessons about how to buy and sell real estate obtain financing and spot undervalued properties though the business no longer operates mr trump has vowed to bring it back giving it to his children to run if he is elected president as he campaigns across the country boasting about the trump university success story he and his lawyers have deployed the evaluations to try to undercut the claims of former students who say they regret paying for the courses posting their reviews online and in one instance waving them in front of a camera that was the case with mr guillo 76 who lives on long island and filed an affidavit in the new york case after the former student criticized trump university in a campaign commercial for a super pac supporting senator marco rubio mr trump uploaded a video to youtube in which he produced a copy of mr guillo s positive evaluation all excellent mr trump said of the scores one hundred percent in court papers a lawyer for mr trump argued that another student suing the university was either dishonest in his evaluations of trump university or the allegations in the complaint are false by all accounts student evaluations held a crucial place inside trump university where students signed up for real estate training programs with escalating costs that promised to teach the mogul s techniques and wisdom at free 90 minute introductory sessions trump university representatives marketed three day workshops starting at 995 at those more intensive programs were pitched like trump gold elite whose price reached 35 000 at the conclusion of every program teachers instructed attendees to complete surveys rating the experience on a scale of 1 to 5 but in what academics and experts said were unusual practices trump university did not explicitly offer students anonymity on the forms often asked them to complete the documents in the presence of instructors and according to internal trump university documents made public in litigation asked students to submit the surveys in exchange for their graduation certificates does the word coercion come to mind asked howard e haller a former trump university consultant who has worked in the education world for decades in normal academic settings he said no one knows if you even filled it out the professor sure doesn t know lawyers for mr trump said students could elect not to put their names on the surveys as some did but they said the documents did not specify that doing so was an option most evaluations the lawyers added were handed out by staff members and completed in large classrooms where it was not possible for a teacher to influence the outcome tad lignell a mentor in the more personalized 35 000 program said that a number of his students achieved financial success from the lessons he had taught them but he conceded that the evaluation system made it uncomfortable for students to register their disapproval assigned to demonstrate how to buy and sell real estate in places such as las vegas mr lignell routinely asked students to fill out the evaluations in front of him at restaurants or coffee shops he said in an interview at that moment he said vulnerable students still needed and expected his guidance i want this guy to be my friend i need his help he said summing up their mind set as they filled out the forms virtually all his students he said gave him the top rating of 5 had they not his income 5 500 per student and later 4 500 could have been in jeopardy he said that trump university managers made clear that teachers with low ratings would be passed over in favor of those with high scores that puts an emphasis on getting 5 he said if you wanted more students you knew you needed those mr lignell said that trump university had failed to pay him for several students the company s lawyer did not comment on the claim if trump wins the presidency mr lignell said i ve got a president who owes me 50 000 mr tufenkian who enrolled in the 35 000 trump gold elite program with his wife sona to jump start a career in real estate said his mentor was adamant that he needed all 5s on his evaluation he even said something like i won t leave until you give me all 5s recalled mr tufenkian who lives in oregon when it was time to fill the evaluation out he put it in front of me right between the two of us on the table and reiterated that he expected all 5s while he watched me mr tufenkian who had just finished a three day visit with his mentor said he obliged because the program was supposed to be the start of a productive yearlong relationship am i supposed to upset the guy who s supposed to be helping me be successful not every student felt compelled in court filings lawyers for mr trump introduced the testimony of students such as amy hinderer who participated in the trump gold elite program every rating i gave my mentor was always positive and i still agree with what i said to this day she wrote mr trump has dismissed the criticism that trump university s evaluation system encouraged positive reviews asked about the lack of anonymity he said under oath in a january deposition i think it s much better when a student puts their name on it without names he said they don t mean anything actually pressed on whether students might fear repercussions mr trump rejected the notion only a lawyer could think of that mr trump said continuing you mean that s why they said such great things about the school he added i think they meant it was very good until they found out they could get their money back but experts said such practices were designed to influence the evaluations people don t want a fight people don t want to be mean people want to be nonconfrontational said john t reed who was hired as a potential paid expert witness for the plaintiffs in one of the trump lawsuits but has no current role in the cases so they write a seminar evaluation and hand it in face to face that mr reed added is where you get your 98 percent advertisement
