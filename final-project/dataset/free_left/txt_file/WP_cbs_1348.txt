watch cbsn live may 15 2019 8 52 am cbs ap he s been contradicted by one of his top advisers dinged in fact checks and called out by top economists still president donald trump is sticking to dubious declarations about trade policy raising questions among experts and even his allies about whether he either can t or won t grasp trade fundamentals this week as he escalates a trade war with china mr trump has misstated how the tariffs are paid who pays them and the significance and size of the trade deficit his assertions came even as others in the white house worry about whether trump s zeal for tariffs could have a political price in airing his grievances against china and promoting his administration s tariffs mr trump has exaggerated the size of the trade deficit wrongly claiming the u s loses 500 billion in trade to china he s also repeatedly misstated how tariffs working saying that china pays the duties to the u s government when in fact american consumers and businesses are paying the hefty import tax it s not as if the u s is losing actual dollars in its trade deficit with china or any other country for that matter the trade deficit refers to the gap between the value of imports and exports and economists note that they aren t considered inherently bad or good the president s frequent claims provide a window into his long held beliefs on trade and the difficulty of changing his economic worldview they also signal that trump may not back off the hawkish approach easily and is almost certain to continue to misrepresent the likely impact trump s views on tariffs depart from conventional economics in at least three ways he has repeatedly claimed that the chinese not americans are paying the 25 tariff he has imposed on 250 billion of chinese imports he has described the trade deficits that the united states runs with other individual countries as total economic losses and he argues that the u s trade deficit with all other countries combined is a result of bad trade policy on all three questions trade experts fundamentally disagree it is u s companies that import retailers wholesalers and manufacturers that pay the duties that trump has imposed not chinese companies one of trump s top economic advisers larry kudlow admitted as much in a television interview sunday but trump tweeted on monday tariffs are now being paid to the united states by china of 25 on 250 billion dollars worth of goods products these massive payments go directly to the treasury of the u s that s simply not true it s certainly possible that a huge retail chain for example could push its chinese supplier to cut its prices to offset the tariffs china s currency may also decline in value which makes chinese exports cheaper and international corporations may decide to locate their plants elsewhere such as in mexico or vietnam depriving china of jobs and export revenue but studies released in march found that those factors haven t made much difference and that nearly the entire cost of the import taxes is falling on u s consumers and businesses one of the studies by economists at ucla and the world bank found that american firms and shoppers lost 68 8 billion last year because of higher tariffs trump made taking a tough line with china an animating feature of his underdog presidential campaign and some of his advisers believe that even if the trade battle leads to short term economic pain it will have been worth it this is an epic fail of the wall street junta to have president trump accept a deal that was detrimental to the country he rejected that says steve bannon trump s chief strategist on the 2016 campaign he is not going to be tainted with a bad deal he intuitively knows that this is the right thing to do there has long been division within the west wing about tariffs effectiveness trump has often sided with china hawk peter navarro who argues that tariffs work but gary cohn the former director of the national economic council argued strenuously against them tariffs don t work if anything they hurt the economy because if you re a typical american worker you have a finite amount of income to spend if you have to spend more on the necessity products that you need to live you have less to spend on the services that you want to buy and you definitely don t have anything left over to save cohn told the freakonomics podcast in march his efforts to bring trump around to that way of thinking were a failure i was losing the war on tariffs every day with the president i knew i wasn t convincing him i was right cohn said in the interview i was not going to take a 74 year old man who s believed something since he was 30 and convince him that i was right some of trump s fellow republicans expressed weariness tuesday about the standoff with china senate majority leader mitch mcconnell declared ultimately nobody wins a trade war and kansas sen jerry moran said it s been said if you don t like the tariffs just don t buy something from china i understand that sentiment but what we do in kansas is we sell to china not dealing with china is not an option economists also dispute trump s portrayal of the u s trade deficit with china which reached 378 7 billion last year as evidence that beijing is ripping off the united states mary lovely an economics professor at syracuse university says trump is ignoring a simple point the u s obtained goods and services for that money it s like going to walmart and you giving them money and they re giving you goods she said there s an exchange trade experts typically consider one nation s trade deficit with another as economically irrelevant the united states also has a trade deficit with all other countries in the world combined which reached 622 1 billion last year most economists aren t very concerned about that as long as so many nations are willing to finance that deficit by purchasing u s treasury bonds and other assets trump frequently blames the overall deficit on bad trade deals he is in the midst of reworking several agreements including one with canada and mexico but that s not really the cause a country runs a trade deficit when like the united states it consumes more than it produces that s why the u s trade deficit typically falls sharply in a recession when americans spend less we run deficits because we re a wealthy country that can buy things that it doesn t produce said joe brusuelas chief economist at rsm a tax consulting firm trade deficits fundamentally don t matter first published on may 15 2019 8 52 am 2019 cbs interactive inc all
