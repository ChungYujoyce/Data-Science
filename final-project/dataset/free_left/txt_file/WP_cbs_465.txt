night and he directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern syria margaret brennan and over what time period will you be pulling back mark esper well it will be a deliberate withdrawal margaret brennan secretary of defense mark esper broke the news to us just a short time ago we ll have that interview the move comes after president trump pulled back dozens of american troops from northern syria a move that cleared the way for turkey to stage an incursion there attacking the kurds a group that has long been a u s ally in the fight against isis mister trump s actions have alienated both his allies abroad and on capitol hill president donald trump i m sort of an island of one again margaret brennan we ll have reaction from republican congressman adam kinzinger then week three of the impeachment inquiry was notable for new subpoenas behind closed doors testimony and the white house stonewalling president donald trump so they re pursuing an illegal invalid and

from two brand new cbs polls all that plus analysis on the news of the week just ahead on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation we are following two very big stories this sunday the impeachment investigation and the president s decision to pull u s troops out of syria a move that has turned into an international crisis we begin this morning with the secretary of defense mark esper mister secretary welcome to face the nation 3 mark esper secretary of defense esperdod good morning margaret thank you for having me margaret brennan the president pulled back from the border with turkey but there are still about a thousand u s troops in syria are you evacuating them mark esper look it s a very terrible situation over there a situation caused by the turks by president erdogan despite our opposition they decided to make this incursion into syria and at this point in time in the last twenty four hours we learned that they likely intend to expand their attack further south than originally planned and to the west and so we know that s happening we also have learned in the last twenty four hours that the syrian forces intend i m sorry the kurdish forces margaret brennan the sdf mark esper are looking to cut the sdf are looking to cut a deal if you will with the syrians and the russians to to counter attack against the turks in the north and so we find ourselves as we have american forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies and it s a very untenable situation so i spoke with the president last night after discussions with the rest of the national security team and he directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern syria margaret brennan a deliberate withdrawal from the entire country mark esper from northern syria margaret brennan from northern syria mark esper right which is where most of our forces are margaret brennan so the one thousand troops mark esper that s correct margaret brennan how long and over what time period will you be pulling back mark esper well it s going to be a deliberate withdrawal and we want to conduct it as as safely and quickly as possible so we want to make sure we deconflict a pullback of forces we want to make sure we don t leave equipment behind so i m not prepared to put a timeline on it but that s that s our general game plan margaret brennan you said you re doing this for u s force protection because of two advancing armies those armies are advancing after the u s had already pulled back after the u s air force mark esper right margaret brennan that had controlled the airspace stopped doing so 4 mark esper well we still have margaret brennan do you actually believe they would advance if u s forces were there in in the numbers and with the force and with the commander in chief saying don t do this mark esper i do because in my lead up to talks with my counterpart of the past several weeks i ve been on the job a little bit over two months it became very clear to me that the turks were fully committed to conducting this incursion the turks were committed to doing this this should not be a surprise and if you go back in time to when we first began this relationship with the with the syrian kurds at that time in 2014 the turks were protesting at that moment margaret brennan right mark esper and it s gone on and on and since that time they ve actually implemented three incursions into northern syria margaret brennan but do you actually believe turkey would fire on u s forces we are nato allies mark esper well i don t know whether they have they would or they wouldn t we have reports already of indiscriminate fire landing near american forces but they just margaret brennan was that accidental mark esper well we don t know margaret brennan was that deliberate mark esper we need margaret brennan was that reckless mark esper we need to sort that out we ve given them the locations of our forces but look i i ve been to war i know what wars like there s a fog out there and things happen and we want to make sure we don t put our soldiers in a situation where they could be killed or injured and look even if the turks decided not to attack forces i mean they got over fifteen thousand forces what we decide to pull back from that immediate zone of attack was about less than fifty maybe two dozen forces it would be irresponsible for me to keep them in that position and allow margaret brennan but you did have u s air force mark esper and we still do margaret brennan controlling airspace mark esper and we and we still do it was an a coordinated arrangement between us and the turks and despite our protestations despite the fact that we urged the turks not to do this they decided to do it and we told them that we would not support them militarily in this action 5 margaret brennan so how does that not amount to a retreat you re saying that the president of the united states the commander in chief said don t do this and then erdo an said i am and he said okay mark esper well i margaret brennan i m not going to fire back mark esper i wouldn t characterize margaret brennan i m going to pull back mark esper i i wouldn t characterize it this way that way what i m saying is we did not want to put american forces into harm s way we did not want to get involved in a conflict that dates back nearly two hundred years between the turks and the kurds and get involved in another yet another war in the middle east margaret brennan well when it comes to the forces you re talking about the sdf you referred to you said it has developed in the last twenty four hours that you ve learned mark esper right margaret brennan they ve struck a deal with russia mark esper well they are working on a deal i don t know that it s been finalized yet but we re pretty confident that they will go in that direction barring some we re trying to make some last minute interventions with president erdogan but again my expectation is president erdogan would not agree to a cease fire he would not agree to move back across the border which we ve been pushing him to do and so every there s every expectation that the again that the syrian kurds would cut a deal with the syrian and russian forces margaret brennan but to be clear the reason the syrian kurds are striking a deal here is to protect themselves from being killed by turkey mark esper that s right margaret brennan but that s what the united states was doing for them they were our allies that we were advising and assisting and protecting it it sounds a lot like they were being left to be slaughtered so what choice were they left other than to find someone else to protect them mark esper look the this the kurds have been very good partners in the d isis campaign they were very good fighters on the battlefield we obviously enabled that as well but at the same time we didn t sign up to fight the turks on their behalf and we ve been very clear with them about that that s why since i came into office over two months ago i worked week after week with my defense minister counterpart from turkey and urged them not to do this we cited all the reasons that are now playing out the biggest being the likely release of isis fighters from these camps and prisons not just that we see a humanitarian crisis emerging we that this relationship between the united states and turkey is being damaged their 6 standing in nato and europe is being hurt we see european capitals coming out and criticizing president erdogan for for this these actions everything that we told them all the reasons why we told them not to do this are are coming to bear margaret brennan and what price will they pay for it mark esper well we ll see over time you see that that some european countries are already talking about specific sanctions and actions the president is talking about the same we should expect to see something like that along those same lines margaret brennan doesn t that just drive them into the arms of russia mark esper i don t think so we got to see how this plays out but again we ve got to take this one step at a time it s a very fluid situation it s changing by the hour margaret brennan you just in the past few hours online mark esper mm hm margaret brennan there have been videos circulating horrific videos showing execution of some of these kurdish allies of ours there are reports of hundreds of isis fighters and family members just running free there are over a hundred thousand individuals fleeing this violence according to the u n does the united states have any idea who these forces are that turkey is sending in who these militias are mark esper it s terrible it s a terrible situation we condemn it we have condemned it it s these are justice things that we told the turks would happen and play out who s conducting it it s unclear at this point in time there are kurdish regular for i m sorry there are turkish regular forces and there are turkish proxy forces margaret brennan right mark esper engaged as well margaret brennan and we don t know who they are mark esper we don t know exactly that s right we don t know exactly who they all are and what they are doing but we re hearing the same reports from the battlefield as well margaret brennan these are war crimes mark esper it appears to be if true that they are would be war crimes margaret brennan european allies are looking at this and when they hear the president say things like these isis fighters will just flee to europe they say that is not appreciating the alliance that turkey has been far too permissive in allowing isis fighters within its territory they see this as inevitable that we are headed towards a terrorist attack mark esper we we 7 margaret brennan because of this chaos that the u s is allowing in the vacuum mark esper well let s be clear the united states is not allowing this turkey committed this action they decided to make an incursion in northern syria despite our protestations our urgings not to do it all of our warnings they decided to do it the situation with the isis margaret brennan but the u s is being permissive arguably by pulling back mark esper we we are margaret brennan and not stopping them mark esper we are doing what s in the interests of our service members not to put them in harm s way not to put twenty thirty forty soldiers up against a fifteen thousand man army which is using airstrikes artillery and ground forces to prosecute a war against the turks whose roots go back over two hundred years margaret brennan if the u s is fired at do forces have the ability to defend themselves mark esper they do margaret brennan can they fire back mark esper they do absolutely general milley has made that clear to his counterpart i made that clear to my counterpart i warned him just the other day that they need to respect our positions on the ground they need to respect our forces and i reminded them that we have the right of self defense and we will execute it if necessary margaret brennan very quickly are you going to comply with the subpoena that the house provided you and provide documents to them regarding to the halt to military aid to ukraine mark esper yeah we will do everything we can to cooperate with the congress just in the last week or two my general counsel sent out a note as we typically do in these situations to ensure documents are retained margaret brennan is that a yes mark esper that s a yes margaret brennan you will comply with the subpoena mark esper we will do everything we can to comply margaret brennan okay all right thank you very much mister secretary appreciate it mark esper thank you margaret margaret brennan we taped that interview a short time ago since then our david martin reports that a u s official has told him u s troops have already begun moving out of their 8 positions in northern syria we ll have a report from syria later on in the broadcast but we want to go now to illinois republican congressman adam kinzinger he is in ottawa illinois good morning to you congressman representative adam kinzinger r illinois repkinzinger good morning margaret brennan you wanted the president to rethink his position we know from secretary esper this decision to pull out was made last night what is the implication going to be representative adam kinzinger well it s going to be terrible and you know the secretary is doing his job and you know he has to follow orders but the reality we all know that if there were still those thirty or forty soldiers in that part of syria that turkey wouldn t attack we actually had a pretty good kind of joint security situation being setup to de escalate that area in fact pulling back those fifty troops or whatever it was has given license to turkey and then now i think pulling out the remaining thousand in syria is simply an excuse to get out look at it this way you hear the president and people like rand paul talk about endless wars all the time and it s kitschy but actually we were preventing an endless war and and that actually commenced on sunday now a week ago and so it s really depressing and you know for me as as a guy that served in the military and really got into politics because i believe in the role america plays to see this yet again you know leaving an ally behind abandoning people that we frankly told that we were going to be with is disheartening depressing frankly it s weak and i don t see how it follows through on the president s promise his biggest promise of the campaign to defeat isis because i think it is going to resurge margaret brennan is the president putting u s national security at risk representative adam kinzinger yes i certainly i i think so yeah and i mean look look at what s going to happen out of here now we have another group that now believes they can t rely on the united states th there s a lot of complication in the kurd situation and i ve seen all this russian misinformation now on the internet that s being picked up by some of these political blogs that these are the bad kurds and there s good kurds well look there are kurds that aren t aren t the best folks in the world but there are also people that we have chosen to equip to fight isis that we were with we had created a situation in which there was stability and out of an impulsive decision i think that the president made otherwise it was cold and calculated because he d been thinking about it for a while and nobody else knew the kurds found out on twitter for goodness sakes we have left them to the wolves and and the message this is sending to our allies around the world i think is is really going to be bad margaret brennan so what are republicans in congress going to do about it are you completely powerless representative adam kinzinger no we are not powerless i mean the president has a lot of power though and i said that no matter even under president obama i said the president s got a lot of power that s in the constitution the things we can do we are going to do we ve got a resolution of condemnation i think next week as well as some significant sanctions the president tweeted about sanctions this morning but i think he needs to make sure he s following through on them and they re not going to be surface sanctions they re going to really hit turkey hard and then the other thing we can do is be outspoken about this the 9 american people you know who want strength and leadership who were promised by this president that we would defeat isis deserve to hear the truth and not these things like end with endless war that you hear some on the kind of libertarian spectum spectrum talk about there is now a war that s been commenced in syria because we have pulled fifty troops out from being able to prevent that war margaret brennan you heard the secretary acknowledge war crimes the state department has said they re afraid of ethnic cleansing so looking at all of that aren t sanctions just punitive they re not preventative representative adam kinzinger yeah margaret brennan is there a responsibility here to do something representative adam kinzinger yeah well i think there is i think it is not necessarily going to prevent turkey from doing what they are doing this has been turkey s dream for a long time and the president basically gave the green light to do it they re going to be important but i think we also have to continue to say this which is when the united states backs away chaos follows through and we had a situation of stability there it wasn t perfect erdogan probably didn t want to have to do joint patrols with the u s margaret brennan right representative adam kinzinger because he wanted to attack but we re the united states of america and we can prevent things like that we have to remember the strength we have and not just try to run away from every conflict we could have margaret brennan so the wall street journal had an editorial that was pretty strong here in sharply criticizing the president quote for his habit of impulsive judgment and they argued that his judgment can be so reckless that many voters who took a risk on him the first time will ask if he s worth a second gamble in 2020 impeachment won t defeat donald trump in 2020 but donald trump might does this make you question whether you re going to support president trump in 2020 representative adam kinzinger well i m i m not going to go there and question whether i m going to support but it does you know i think the president needs to be aware that in and i know republican base voters i represent both republicans and democrats i have a republican district one of the things they loved about donald trump is they re like he says what he means he s tough he s taken the fight to isis and i m having a hard time seeing how basically pulling out of syria margaret brennan mm hm representative adam kinzinger and it s not just about protecting the kurds it s about getting intel and fighting isis and i don t see how that s going to be a position of strength so we ll have to see how 2020 plays out on that margaret brennan yes no should erdogan come to the white house next month as planned 10 representative adam kinzinger no absolutely not margaret brennan thank you congressman we ll be back in one minute with the chairman of the house intelligence committee adam schiff don t go away announcements margaret brennan we turn now to the other big story we have been watching that of the impeachment inquiry into charges that the president and his allies pressured ukraine to investigate unsubstantiated allegations of wrongdoing by former vice president joe biden and his son hunter we re joined now by the chairman of the house intelligence committee adam schiff good morning to you chairman good to have you here representative adam schiff intelligence committee chairman repadamschiff d california good morning margaret brennan before we move to impeachment i want to ask for your reaction to the president s decision to pull out of syria representative adam schiff well i agree with my republican colleague i think this is disastrous it s a complete capitulation to erdogan that is putting at great peril probably our strongest ally in the fight against isis and that is the syrian kurds they were fighting side by side with american forces we have pulled the rug out from under them they re being slaughtered there are war crimes being committed against them and we re seeing isis fighters released from custody just as we predicted would happen and for the president to say well you know they re just going to go to europe we re not going to have an ally left after this presidency you can imagine how europe feels about the president of the united states saying well we re not really concerned about foreign fighters going to europe they re going to pose a direct threat to our homeland as well and we ought to care about our allies this wouldn t be happening but for this impulsive decision by the president to capitulate to erdogan by precipitously withdrawing our forces it s just what secretary mattis warned against erdogan took this as a green light and who can blame him for perceiving that that was the president s intention and the consequences will be far lasting the damage to our standing the fact the kurds are now entertaining going to the russians to protect them because the americans wouldn t this is just an unmitigated disaster and and i deeply fear as secretary mattis has said that this will result in the resurgence of isis margaret brennan well i want to get to the other big topic and that is the impeachment inquiry that you are leading do you see this widening representative adam schiff well we re keeping our focus right now on the president s coercion of an ally that is ukraine to create these sham investigations into his political opponent we have discovered in very short order not only the contents of that call but also the preparatory work that went into that call the effort to condition something the ukrainian president deeply sought and that was a meeting with the president to establish that this new president of ukraine had a powerful patron the president of the united states it was of vital importance to ukraine was being conditioned on digging up dirt on the bidens 11 margaret brennan so you see that as the quid pro quo representative adam schiff well margaret brennan not just the military aid representative adam schiff first of all there doesn t need to be a quid pro quo but it is clear already i think from the text messages that this meeting that the ukraine president sought was being conditioned on their willingness to interfere in the u s election to help the president that is a terrible abuse of the president s power now whether that abuse goes further that is the withholding of military aid also as leverage margaret brennan mm hm representative adam schiff there s certainly strong indications that that is true as well and we re going to get to the bottom of it but here you have a president of the united states abusing his power to the detriment of our national security and doing so to get yet another foreign country to intervene in our election it s hard to imagine more of a corruption of his office than that margaret brennan when will you begin to hold public hearings the polling that cbs has done has shown that americans really are not clear on what to think about this impeachment inquiry over the past two weeks of work you ve done representative adam schiff well actually you know i think that the public attitudes have swiftly moved in strong support of the impeachment inquiry and you know what we were trying to do is do a methodical and yet with a sense of urgency investigation to these matters margaret brennan well the republicans say it s behind closed doors so you can cherry pick information representative adam schiff well margaret brennan to be released representative adam schiff the the republicans would like nothing better because they view their role as defending the president being the president s lawyers if witnesses could tailor their testimony to other witnesses they would love for one witness to be able to hear what another witness says so that they can know what they can give away and what they can t give away there s a reason why investigations and grand jury proceedings for example and i think this is analogous to a grand jury proceeding are done out of the public view initially now we may very well call some of the same witnesses or all the same witnesses in public hearings as well but we want to make sure that we meet the needs of the investigation and not give the president or his legal minions the opportunity to tailor their testimony and in some cases fabricate testimony to suit their interests margaret brennan you ve been well the whistleblower has made these complaints and hand them handed them over why push for this whistleblower to come before congress because a republicans are calling for it and some democrats would like to ask questions too but this information s already out there can t the committee do its own investigation without 12 risking the identity of this person being representative adam schiff we can margaret brennan public representative adam schiff you know and i think initially before the president started threatening the whistleblower threatening others calling them traitors and spies and suggesting that you know we used to give the death penalty to traitors and spies and maybe we should think about that again yes we were interested in having the whistleblower come forward our primary margaret brennan not anymore representative adam schiff well our primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected indeed now there s more than one whistleblower that they are protected and given that we already have the call record we don t need the whistleblower who wasn t on the call to tell us what took place during the call we have the best evidence of that we do want to make sure that we identify other evidence that is pertinent to the withholding of the military support the effort to cover this up by hiding this in a classified computer system we want to make sure that we uncover the full details about the conditionality of either the military aid or that meeting with ukraine s president it may not be necessary to take steps that might reveal the whistleblower s identity to do that and we re going to make sure we protect that whistleblower margaret brennan you know who was on that july 25th call you know all the participants representative adam schiff i can t say that i do but we now know what took place on that call margaret brennan mm hm representative adam schiff we are bringing in witnesses this coming week from the national security council other state department officials to find out what they can tell us about the conditionality of this vital military assistance to an ally the conditionality of this vital meeting between the two presidents and the president s effort to dig up dirt on his opponent margaret brennan quickly do you regret saying that we the committee weren t in touch with the whistleblower representative adam schiff i should have been much more clear and i said so the minute it was brought to my attention that i was referring to the fact that when the whistleblower filed the complaint we had not heard from the whistleblower we wanted to bring the whistleblower in at that time but i should ve been much more clear about that margaret brennan congressman thank you very much and we will be right back stay with us 13 announcements margaret brennan coming up in our next half hour the latest on the 2020 race for the white house who is up who is down and what impact the impeachment story is having if any on the democratic field with our cbs news battleground tracker stay with us announcements margaret brennan we ll be right back with a lot more face the nation stay with us announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we spoke yesterday with texas republican senator ted cruz he is the highest ranking u s official to visit hong kong since pro democracy protests began four months ago we asked him about the president s saying that the situation in hong kong was dying down senator ted cruz r texas sentedcruz i ll tell you what s happening here in hong kong is inspiring we ve seen over two million people come to the streets standing up for freedom standing up for democracy and and standing up against the oppression of the chinese communist regime and and i think it is very much in the united states interest to support the people of hong kong i m here i m dressed in all black standing in solidarity with the protesters margaret brennan so the protests are not dying out as the president suggested senator ted cruz the protests are continuing full force and i ll tell you something that really illustrates just how powerful the protests are is is what we ve seen happen with the nba this past week daryl morey the general manager of the rockets my hometown team i m a diehard houston rockets fan but but he tweeted a very benign tweet where he said stand for freedom stand with hong kong and and the chinese communist government they just about lost it they got so upset they ended up boycotting the rockets they ended up pulling them off tv in china they ended up pulling them off the internet they ended up canceling all of their sponsorships and sadly what ended up happening is the nba as a league began this series of of apologies and it was really sad to see an american company and indeed a global sports league like the nba being dragooned into censoring the free speech of american citizens in the interest of big bucks it s not complicated why the nba did that margaret brennan mm hm senator ted cruz television and and the chinese market is worth a whole lot of money but but thankfully a whole lot of us across the ideological spectrum indeed i helped lead a group a bipartisan group of members of congress calling on the nba to do better to defend free speech margaret brennan right senator ted cruz and i am proud to say i i think the nba is doing a better job of defending those free speech rights 14 margaret brennan but isn t it really the u s government that should be leading the charge on this rather than free enterprise senator ted cruz well well but but listen american businesses shouldn t be in the business of censoring americans and we ve seen this pattern whether it s the nba afraid of losing a bunch of money in china or whether it s hollywood censoring out any content that is critical of the communist government in china you know it s really an unfortunate dynamic how china uses it its vast resources to promote censorship and all of our allies are facing this increased aggressiveness margaret brennan exactly senator ted cruz of china and we need to stand up we need to defend our shared values margaret brennan exactly so should those kind of protections be in any kind of trade deal with china senator ted cruz well listen a trade deal is is functionally different the senate foreign relations committee just unanimously passed legislation on hong kong to pressure to pressure china to protect the the free speech and democratic rights of the people of hong kong that i am a co sponsor of that legislation margaret brennan right senator ted cruz and it was bipartisan we saw republicans and democrats come together margaret brennan well you re talking about legislation there but what actions we ve seen the trump administration take about muslim minorities who are being put in internment camps in china have been by the state department senator ted cruz yeah margaret brennan pretty limited the commerce department blacklisted some companies how do you stop the trump administration from using that as a bargaining chip in a trade deal senator ted cruz i introduced legislation called the tiananmen act to that that would direct blacklisting the technology companies the chinese technology companies that china is using to engage in surveillance to engage in repression and imprisonment and torture and murder of up to a million uighurs a religious minority and and as you noted just this week the trump administration announced that they were implementing what is the core of my legislation which is blacklisting those chinese technology companies that are being used to suppress religious minorities i think that s a really good step margaret brennan have they assured you senator ted cruz it s a positive step by the administration 15 margaret brennan that won t be in any way considered as a bargaining chip in negotiations senator ted cruz well listen i i think we can do both it s important to get a trade deal with china i hope we do get a trade deal with china we have enormous economic concerns but we can do that at the same time defend our core values margaret brennan china is a a surveillance state is it appropriate for president trump to be saying senator ted cruz yeah margaret brennan china should look into the biden family is that appropriate senator ted cruz i look of course not elections in the u s should be decided by by americans and it s not the business of of foreign countries any foreign countries to be interfering in our elections margaret brennan even ukraine i mean when when you re talking about some of this i mean do you think that say the president s personal attorney rudy giuliani who s been talking about china who s been talking about ukraine do you want to hear him testify about this sort of shadow foreign policy senator ted cruz listen foreign countries should stay out of american elections that s true for russia that s true for ukraine that s true for china that s true for all of them it should be the american people deciding elections i i don t know what rudy s been saying i i do know though that we should decide our elections it should be the american people making those decisions margaret brennan and you do want him to testify before your committee senator ted cruz i i think it d make a lot of sense for rudy to testify before the senate judiciary committee that s that s ultimately a question for the committee chairman lindsey graham but but i d like to see rudy testify yes margaret brennan so the president is often talking about the need to look in to joe biden if he is so concerned would it be in any way appropriate for him to bring it to his own justice department instead of talking about foreign countries looking into his political rival senator ted cruz i have long advocated that the justice department should enforce the law should investigate corruption should investigate violations of law regardless of party margaret brennan but to be clear you re not calling for the justice department to investigate the biden family senator ted cruz look i don t i i believe the justice department should investigate violations of law if there s credible evidence of a violation of law yes they should investigate and i ll tell you what i have called for i think president trump wisely released the transcript of his conversation with the ukrainian government i think that was good because a lot of what the democrats had been raising alleging an illegal quid pro quo was not in fact backed up by the 16 transcript but i think i think actually the administration should do the exact same thing for joe biden that it should release the transcripts of joe biden s conversations with ukraine use the same standard for president trump and joe biden and and let the american people read the transcripts and decide margaret brennan senator cruz we will leave it there thank you for joining us from hong kong we ll be back in a moment announcements margaret brennan for a look at what americans are thinking about all those headlines that are dominating our conversations here on face the nation we turn to anthony salvanto our cbs news elections and survey directors anthony has got two polls for us today and first we ll take a look at the national poll on the impeachment inquiry so anthony over the past two weeks since this has really picked up steam have you seen a change anthony salvanto cbs news elections surveys director salvantocbs not over the last two weeks we do see hardening partisan divisions here we see republicans increasingly saying that they support the president don t think he ought to cooperate with congress democrats even more strongly approving of the inquiry really important when you watch the polls on this is that you differentiate between support for having an inquiry which there is marginal majority support get the facts learn what happened and whether or not they think the president deserves impeachment and that is much more mixed nationally what i think is interesting going forward here margaret is that when you talk to the people who say they don t know which way to go on this they say they aren t paying as much attention and they feel like a lot of this lot of names a lot of places are hard to follow so it may be a challenge for both parties to move beyond their base as they make their arguments when congress returns margaret brennan so over standing things to say building support for impeachment it s more complicated than that anthony salvanto it s more complicated than that margaret brennan our second survey is of democrats in the eighteen states holding the first primary or caucus contest next year according to our cbs news battleground tracker senator elizabeth warren has extended her lead with thirty one percent support among democrats former vice president joe biden is second with twenty five percent support and senator bernie sanders rounds out the top tier with seventeen percent our next group of candidates shows senator kamala harris with seven percent support south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg has five percent support among voters in those eighteen early contests and former congressman beto o rourke has four percent support the other candidates come in with one percent or less so how anthony is all of this controversy affecting the democrats anthony salvanto well the charges of the president s leveled against joe biden they are not hurting him directly most democrats say they aren t true they don t matter haven t changed their views of him but it s biden s response to those charges that s generating kind of a lukewarm response from these early state democrats they say they are somewhat satisfied with that biden response but not very satisfied with it and then we ask well when these 17 candidates if these candidates become the nominee how well would they be able to fend off attacks from the president margaret brennan mm hm anthony salvanto because surely they are going to be coming and only half of people say that they think biden will do that very well you contrast that with elizabeth warren whose numbers are much higher on her perceived ability to fend off attacks from the president i also notice that one of the strengths for joe biden has been what people perceive as his electability the idea that he can beat donald trump among democrats that s down this week and so i think it maybe that you know when you talk about electability it s not just which demographic groups they think a candidate can appeal to it s also how they rate the way they handle the campaign margaret brennan you said elizabeth warren has had a good month anthony salvanto mm hm margaret brennan so what s behind that anthony salvanto well she is up in across these early states she s also then moved up in iowa extended her lead in new hampshire and a lot of that is she is doing particularly well with people who say they want a candidate who is tough her electability numbers have stayed about where they were she is also doing much better than joe biden in being perceived as a candidate who will fight for people like you margaret brennan that s her slogan isn t it anthony salvanto that s one of her it s one of her slogan so that may be resonating and i think a lot of this for her too is you know not just on policy now not just on being seen as specific which she has been in previous polls but she also seems to undercutting some of joe biden s arguments as well as she gains steam margaret brennan the other frontrunner bernie sanders has had a tough month in terms of health problems he had that heart attack is that impacting perception of him anthony salvanto well we have been asking now and in previous polls if folks thought age was a concern for some of these older candidates and the numbers who say that sanders age is a concern are up this week margaret brennan mm hm anthony salvanto we followed up and we asked what specifically is concerning and it was those folks who said it was said well they were worried that he might not be able to do the job of president and all that it requires so there may be some indirect impact on that for sanders having said that the support he does have the folks who support him are among the strongest are the strongest in fact in their support of any other candidate margaret brennan the passion factor 18 anthony salvanto indeed margaret brennan all right anthony thank you all of the results from both of those surveys are now on our website at facethenation com and we will be back in a moment with our panel announcements margaret brennan we d like to bring in our panel now for some political analysis amy walter is the national editor for the cook political report jerry seib is the executive washington editor at the wall street journal and tolu olorunnipa covers the white house for the washington post he is also a cnn political analyst thank you all for being here jerry i want to start off with you just the news of the morning what we heard from the secretary of defense the pull out of at least hundreds of gerald seib wall street journal geraldfseib mm hm margaret brennan american troops from the north of the country unclear when the remaining will be moved out it sounds like they are first headed to iraq unclear what the plan is gerald seib yeah margaret brennan to counter the counterterrorism threat how is this going to be digested gerald seib well first of all it s striking how ugly this has turned how quickly you have turkish troops moving further into syria than they promised you have isis prisoners on the loose apparently you have u s troops getting out of harm s way because they were in fact in harm s way you have a lot of tension within the nato alliance because you have a nato ally a nato member undertaking an action that everybody including the u s opposes and so that s a pretty ugly picture i also think though it s striking that you have president trump saying this is an an attempt to end endless wars and it kind of tells you exactly how seriously he took this promise he thinks he made in the 2016 sic campaign to get u s forces out of the middle east and how intent he is on not being accused of failing to make good on that promise by time the 2020 campaign gets around makes you wonder a little bit about what s going to happen in iraq and afghanistan between now and the 2020 election amy walter cook political report amyewalter the takeaway right margaret brennan and we didn t even mention the fact that on friday the pentagon announced they re actually upping the number of u s troops in the middle east this isn t actually withdrawing from the region amy walter right margaret brennan it s adding another eighteen thousand or eighteen hundred excuse me to saudi arabia 19 amy walter but i think jerry s right it s a little bit of the check the box right the closer that we get to the election the more that he focuses on being able to say i fulfilled the promises i made in 2016 the the lengths he s taken on security on the border right building the wall showing how many folks have been apprehended at the border we re now i think on our fifth homeland security head since the his administration has started margaret brennan kevin mcaleenan amy walter yes margaret brennan the acting secretary resigned on friday amy walter resigned so with the sole focus of that position which was designed as a broader umbrella for security right an american security and coordinating security within the u s has been focused almost exclusively on the southern border and his the president s focus on making sure that he can say on election day i have been able to fulfill x y and z gerald seib and and we should not lose sight of the fact that a lot of people will cheer at that amy walter yes of course gerald seib i mean the foreign policy establishment is appalled but there is a certain base of support for just let s just get out and he s going to tap into that margaret brennan tolu obviously the promise resonates to pull u s troops out of the middle east because democrats are also running on that message toluse olorunnipa washington post toluseo mm hm margaret brennan but it s the how it happens when it happens if it s planned that is what the national security establishment toluse olorunnipa hm margaret brennan usually tries to plan to minimize damage what we heard from the defense secretary is all of this was decided just last night toluse olorunnipa yeah i thought it was pretty remarkable what secretary esper said he said that we predicted that all of this negative and horrible stuff would happen once the turks went into syria but we still stood down and allowed it to happen it doesn t make it sound better to say that we knew that this was going to happen but we thought you know we could not stop them from doing it we have the president that says you know we re america first we re the strongest military we ve rebuilt the military but at the same time we can prevent these atrocities from happening we just had to stand down because the turks were determined to go in it didn t seem like there was a plan about what to do once that happened now it seems like they re trying to put together a plan president s tweeting and threatening sanctions but there s not a clear sense that there is a strategy involved and we saw what happened in 2014 with the rise of isis and how well they used social media to really put fear in the hearts of a lot of 20 americans and a lot of american voters and republicans use that as a weapon against president obama and if we see that reemerge if we see those types of videos and images coming out of the region once again they could threaten president trump s reelection as well amy walter yeah margaret brennan so it it s usually thought of it as a cliche oh foreign policy doesn t matter to voters national security doesn t amy walter right margaret brennan is that true amy walter unless it doesn t until it does and tolu is right when it looks like it s directly impacting americans that s when that s when it really matters but i also think it s important to to understand when we re talking about fulfilling his campaign promises and checking those boxes and i think jerry is right that yes for a lot of voters they do think that s one of the things that they like about him but remember there is this whole group of voters out there who voted for donald trump in 2016 not necessarily because they liked what he was saying or they wanted him to fulfill these promises but they didn t necessarily like the other choice that they had now what they re having to choose from and i think this is an example of this is do they want another four years of a presidency where things seem to happen without any strategic thinking where there s so much chaos the wall street journal editorial margaret brennan mm hm amy walter put it this way right this impulsive judgment that is the challenge right now for trump going forward it s not is his base excited our democrats engaged it s that small sliver of people who might not necessarily have been enamored with donald trump in the first place but they are exhausted by what s been happening over these last couple of years and the prospect of it continuing margaret brennan i want to i want to talk about one of the people who s running as an alternative joe biden who has been linked to this impeachment inquiry because the accusations around ukraine and his son his son hunter today releasing a statement really kind of commenting for the first time on all of this saying that if his pres his father becomes president he won t serve on the board of a foreign firm resigning from the firm he does serve on in in china and i want to play this sound bite from the vice president joe biden because he really responded for one of the first times this week joe biden we all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and shoot someone and get away with it it s no joke he s shooting holes in the constitution and we cannot let him get away with it crowd cheering joe biden to preserve our constitution our democracy our basic integrity he should be impeached margaret brennan so that public call was really the first time the vice president has said 21 he s he s putting his shoulder behind it gerald seib and he s been very cautious about impeachment as a lot of mainstream democrats have been like let s we saw this movie in the 1980s with bill clinton that didn t turn out well for the republicans let s be careful but he came out this week it puts him more in sync with the democratic base and now i think that biden campaign is doing something very interesting they are trying to say essentially president trump is trying to drag me joe biden down because he fears me the most and that plays right into the biden campaign narrative which is i am the most formidable candidate to defeat president trump president trump is making that case for me you democrats ought to take heed and understand that i am the formidable candidate who you can turn to to defeat president trump that s not a bad message for the biden campaign to put out margaret brennan and tolu how is the white house how is the president responding to the impeachment inquiry we can see the tweets what s actually happened toluse olorunnipa well as we talked about they re not being much of a strategy with the syria policy it doesn t seem like there s much of a counter impeachment strategy beyond you know having these outside lawyers say that the president is immune that the president should not be investigated the president going out doing more rallies than normal and saying that this is a coup that this is an an attempt by democrats to overturn the 2016 election so he s going to push forward some language that may seem unsettling to a lot of people as he tries to counter this impeachment inquiry but there s no sense that there s an actual strategy a war room within the white house to push back against any of this margaret brennan and how is it landing amy walter well i think the point that your recent poll just put forward is that the biden defense that this is actually good for me this makes me look like the frontrunner and that trump s afraid of me isn t really borne out by those numbers how well they handle attacks from trump warren up over biden by fifteen points so i think that as of this point it has not been as effective as they would have liked it to be margaret brennan all right thanks to all of you we ll be right back with a report from syria announcements margaret brennan we close today with a look at the situation in syria from cbs news foreign correspondent charlie d agata who just filed this report from northern
