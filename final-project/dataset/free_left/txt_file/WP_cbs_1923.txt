watch cbsn live by walecia konrad april 21 2020 10 58 am moneywatch although most americans diagnosed with covid 19 are able to recover at home treatment for the roughly 15 of patients who require hospitalization can be exorbitantly expensive and while many insurers are helping people pay for coronavirus related costs figuring exactly what is covered and what isn t can be confusing here s what you can expect from your health insurer if you need testing or treatment stemming from the virus all comprehensive health insurance plans must pick up 100 of the cost of coronavirus testing as well as any visit to the emergency room doctor s office or urgent care center that may have led to that testing that includes any covid 19 test deemed appropriate by the u s department of health and human services comprehensive health plans are individual employer sponsored or exchange plans that meet the coverage requirements spelled out in the affordable care act if you re insured by a short term plan or another plan that isn t aca compliant your insurer may not cover the costs associated with your test insurers must also provide free antibody testing for covid 19 patients under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act that president donald trump signed into law last last month by measuring blood for immune proteins antibody testing may indicate that someone has had a coronavirus infection and may be protected from future infections but health care professionals are concerned about the effectiveness of the antibody tests how they would be administered and how patient privacy would be maintained medicaid will cover the full cost of covid 19 testing for the uninsured as directed by the cares act dozens of insurers including aetna cigna and humana have waived co payments co insurance and deductibles for all covid 19 treatments that includes hospital stays according to america s health insurance plans an industry trade group in most cases these waivers apply only to in network care but some companies such as allways health partners will cover patient cost sharing out of network when no in network providers are available this can be important in the hardest hit parts of the u s where coronavirus patients may be directed to certain hospitals and providers that are designated to treat covid 19 may not be in your insurer s network some insurers also place a time limit on the waivers for instance blue cross blue shield is waiving cost sharing through may while others such as carefirst are offering full coverage indefinitely not every insurer will cover all out of pocket costs from treating covid 19 the same goes for some self funded employer plans even if the plan is administered by an insurer that does cover those costs in full with the differences in cost sharing among plans it makes sense to check this health insurerlistor call your insurance company to find out exactly what is and isn t covered should you or a family member need treatment for the virus if you find you do need covid 19 treatment you ll need to keep track of what tests medication and treatment you receive clearly that s not easy for someone who is seriously ill and kept separate from family members or otherwise isolated that said a comprehensive account of the treatment you received will help when the bill arrives and you find you haven t gotten coverage that may be mandated even if you re isolated you can sign a medical authorization form that will allow someone to talk to doctors and nurses on your behalf medicare part a and part b which cover hospital stays and doctor visits respectively will continue to charge already established co pays and deductibles for part a the deductible for a hospital stay up to 60 days is 1 408 part b carries a 198 annual deductible many original medicare recipients also have medicare supplement insurance called medigap to help cover medicare cost sharing most medigap policies should cover co pays deductibles and other cost sharing related to covid 19 if you have a medicare advantage plan which is private insurance that covers medicare part a and part b and often prescription drug benefits your covid 19 cost sharing will depend on your plan again many insurers say they are waiving out of pocket expenses for coronavirus testing and treatment medicare advantage plans almost always use a network of providers to lower costs the government now requires medicare advantage plans to cover out of network providers as long as they accept medicare payments the estimated cost of coronavirus related hospitalizations for uninsured patients in the u s range from 14 billion to 42 billion according to estimates from the kaiser family foundation that doesn t include other treatment costs outside of the hospital government relief efforts have allocated 100 billion in funding for hospitals and other health care providers to cover the costs of covid 19 treatments so far the trump administration has provided few details about how funding would be distributed but the idea is that federal funds would cover the cost of treating the uninsured newly unemployed patients who have lost their health insurance may find they qualify for medicaid coverage especially in states where the program has been expanded in general cost sharing is minimal with medicaid if you have a health savings account or flexible spending account associated with a high deductible health care plan that allows you to pay for qualified medical expenses with pretax dollars you now have more flexibility under the cares act qualified medical expenses were extended to include over the counter medicines feminine hygiene products and telemedicine visits including virtual mental health appointments the telemedicine provision is especially important said shobin uralil co founder of hsa provider lively at a time when people aren t venturing out to go to the doctor virtual appointments are taking over
