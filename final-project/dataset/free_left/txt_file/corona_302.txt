advertisement supported by the president facing grim figures from his health advisers starkly reversed an earlier upbeat assessment that the country could relax the guidelines by easter by michael d shear washington president trump retreated sunday from his desire to relax coronavirus guidelines by easter announcing instead that all americans must continue to avoid nonessential travel going to work eating at bars and restaurants or gathering in groups of more than 10 for at least another month and perhaps until june the grim recommendation which the president made in the white house rose garden came just a day before the end of a two week period in which the world s largest economy has largely shut down with staggering consequences businesses shuttered schools and colleges emptied and social life all but suspended mr trump said repeatedly last week that he wanted to reverse such drastic measures soon perhaps by easter on april 12 in the hopes of restarting the economy but public health experts including the president s own advisers had warned that trying to return to normal life too quickly risked allowing the virus to rage increasing the likelihood of more infections and raising the number of deaths the president finally appeared on sunday to acknowledge the possibility of deaths on a large scale and back down from weeks of insisting that the threat from the virus might be overblown in the past month mr trump has vacillated between accepting the need for aggressive action to limit the pandemic and complaining that such moves will harm the economy but on sunday his mood seemed somber as he conceded the need for another month of collective pain citing figures from his advisers that showed that as many as 200 000 people could die from the virus even if the country took aggressive action to slow its spread mr trump said the restrictions must continue even if it meant more sacrifice in the days ahead during this period it s very important that everyone strongly follow the guidelines have to follow the guidelines mr trump told reporters with members of the government s coronavirus task force nearby therefore we will be extending our guidelines to april 30 to slow the spread we can expect that by june 1 we will be well on our way to recovery mr trump said we think by june 1 a lot of great things will be happening dr anthony s fauci the nation s leading infectious disease expert said he and other public health officials had urged mr trump not to relax the guidelines too soon dr fauci who in television appearances earlier in the day had offered the estimate of 200 000 dead said mr trump was affected by those predictions the idea that we may have these many cases played a role in our decision in trying to make sure that we don t do something prematurely and pull back when we should be pushing dr fauci said he said extending the guidelines until april 30 was a wise and prudent decision that mr trump reached after discussions over several days with dr deborah l birx the coordinator of the effort to fight the virus and other health officials dr birx and i spent a considerable amount of time going over all the data why we felt this was a best choice for us and the president accepted it dr fauci said aides said that mr trump was muted during the task force meeting before sunday s news conference his mind almost entirely made up to extend the guidelines one adviser said the president recognized that the data about the potential impact of the virus in the united states was bad and could not be bent to his will for weeks mr trump had compared the coronavirus to the flu repeatedly suggesting that many more people die of the flu each year than would succumb to the virus but on sunday he repeatedly cited predictions that up to 2 2 million americans could die from the virus if nothing were done to stop its spread he talked about the viciousness of the virus and revealed that it had sent a friend to the hospital he s a little older and he s heavy but he s a tough person and we went to the hospital and a day later he s in a coma mr trump said how is he doing sir he s in a coma he s unconscious he s not doing well the speed and the viciousness especially if it gets the right person it is horrible the president also expressed horror at the grim scenes playing out at the hospitals in new york city where he spent much of his adult life he cited the situation at elmhurst hospital center i know it very well he said which has been inundated in recent days with people ill from the virus i ve been watching that for the last week on television body bags all over in hallways mr trump said i have been watching them bringing in trailer trucks freezer trucks because they can t handle the bodies there are so many of them this is in essentially my community in queens new york i have seen things that i have never seen before the president s turnabout came as state and local officials across the country confronted rapidly rising numbers of infections that threatened to overwhelm their hospitals amid shortages of protective equipment and fears that there would not be enough doctors and nurses to tend to those who get sick several of the nation s governors said on sunday that they anticipated surges of cases during the next several weeks and they urged their residents to continue to follow social distancing guidelines that would slow the spread of the pandemic if we don t flatten the curve we re on a trajectory currently to exceed our capacity in the new orleans area for ventilators by about april the 4th and all beds available in hospitals by about april the 10th gov john bel edwards democrat of louisiana said on nbc s meet the press program sunday morning so we re doing everything we can to surge capacity it s very difficult gov jay inslee democrat of washington who has frequently clashed with mr trump said before the president s announcement that his state would not be ready to lift social distancing guidelines any time soon boy i would not want to be responsible for opening the door to this virus to ravage our places that seem ok today but within 10 weeks within 10 days can be at full scale burning through our hospital system mr inslee said on cnn s state of the union program and we have seen this happen we have got to be ahead of this curve over the last several days mr trump has lashed out at the governors suggesting that some of them do not appreciate the help that they are getting from him and from others in the federal government mr edwards and several other governors largely steered clear of responding to those criticisms by mr trump instead several of them stressed that they were working with the federal emergency management agency and other federal agencies even as they pleaded for more help getting ventilators surgical masks and other medical equipment they need you know i don t have energy to respond to every slight gov gretchen whitmer democrat of michigan said on state of the union what i m trying to do is work well with the federal government and i will tell you this there are people from the white house on down who are working 24 7 just like we are at the states we re all stressed because we have people that are dying right now still on sunday mr trump repeated a complaint that democratic governors had insulted him and said he would delegate calls with those officials to other people in the white house updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities i don t have to call because i m probably better off not mr trump said describing mr inslee as a nasty person and raising his failed candidacy for the democratic presidential nomination i don t like the governor of washington so you know who calls i get mike pence to call i get the head of fema to call i get the admiral to call because when they disrespect me they re disrespecting our government he said and mr trump once again targeted officials in new york for scorn appearing to suggest that new york hospitals are hoarding or doing something else improper with protective gear like their surgical masks he said that he did not believe they really need the increases in protective equipment they claim are necessary to protect doctors and nurses treating coronavirus patients mr trump said he was told that demand for masks at a new york hospital jumped from 10 000 to 20 000 per week before the virus arrived to nearly 300 000 a week now something s going on and you ought to look into it as reporters where are the masks going are they going out the back door mr trump said somebody should probably look into that because i just don t see from a practical standpoint how that s possible to go from that to that and we have that happening in numerous places the president seemed to be suggesting that new york hospitals were lying about how many masks they needed mr trump said he was given the information about the increased demand for masks at the hospital from an executive of a company that makes them who was sitting in the audience in fact hospitals throughout the country have said the surge in coronavirus patients requires that doctors and nurses change masks repeatedly throughout the day to protect themselves from getting infected that has created a huge shortage of masks mr trump again clashed with reporters chiding yamiche alcindor a pbs reporter and later jeremy diamond a cnn reporter who made a point of giving his question to ms alcindor whom the president cut off earlier in the news conference he instructed ms alcindor to be nice and not threatening while mr diamond s question prompted him to declare cnn is not trusted anymore they are fake news before facing reporters he attacked the the lamestream media on twitter even as he repeatedly trumpeted the high ratings for his coronavirus briefings which have rivaled monday night football and the season finale of the bachelor mr trump also denied on sunday that he had threatened to quarantine new york new jersey and connecticut on saturday despite suggesting 24 hours earlier that he was seriously considering doing just that i didn t do that at all read the statement read the statement read what i said mr trump told a reporter i said we re going to look into possibly quarantine i didn t say we re going to quarantine i looked at it as a possibility because a lot of our professionals suggested quarantine i said we re going to look at it the president s musings about a ban on travel in and out of new york and the other states prompted hours of confusion and some fear as residents of the three states considered rushing to leave before the quarantine was put in place on saturday evening mr trump announced a travel advisory urging people against nonessential travel but stopping short of a quarantine transcript from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today as the pandemic quickly spreads across the u s hundreds of hospitals are now confronting their first serious cases of the coronavirus susan dominus on the lessons from the first confirmed case in new jersey it s monday march 30 sue tell me how you first heard about james cai well a few weeks ago i heard about this young guy a 32 year old physician assistant who was the very first patient in all of new jersey to test positive for covid 19 and so i reached out to him while he was still at the hospital and i was sort of wondering would it possibly be ok could you maybe find some time to talk and he said sure call me now i m in isolation in other words and i have time hello coughing are you there yes coughing ok and what was the story that he told you so james lives and works in new york city so my name is james cai and i m a physician assistant and his mother and grandfather live in new jersey and so he spends quite a bit of time there as well and i work as a primary care urgent care and nursing home p a he came to this country when he was about 16 from shanghai and he s married and has a 20 month old daughter whom he adores why did you go into medicine in the first place why were you drawn to medicine oh because of my grandparents they are doctors my grandfather is an anesthesiologist in shanghai and when i was young i always sick so i always went to his hospital so i had a good impression and as someone working in the medical field was james expecting to interact with this epidemic the coronavirus was he maybe even thinking he would end up treating coronavirus patients well he doesn t work in a hospital and because he works in private practice i think he probably imagined he might be working remotely with telemedicine i actually heard about coronavirus many months ago when china had outbreak but i always followed the disease but because of the family background and because he does work in medicine when news of the coronavirus did start coming out of wuhan he definitely understood how quickly the virus could spread and he definitely understood that the only way to guarantee that you could survive this was by not getting it in the first place around end of february i started to pile up all the food like canned foods frozen vegetables dumplings so soon after the coronavirus landed on the west coast he and his family went to costco and stocked up our family plan is to stay home for two months for like two months worth of supplies right so they were going to avoid any meaningful exposure to the virus yeah if there was communal spread and it had become widespread their plan was to shelter in place and well ahead of the rest of us yeah i think that s right so you weren t sure at what point you would start doing that but you felt you d know when it was time yes but you know he s stocking up at the end of february you know people in the u s were still flying all over the country kids were going to school bloomberg was in the race for president people were planning vacations and weddings and all sorts of conferences and events and the same was true of james so like everybody else he s going about his life and around this time without really too much concern about his health he went to a medical conference in times square so i changed diaper for my daughter and gave her morning milk and i kissed my wife and to go to conference on the fourth day of the conference monday march 2 he comes down with a cough and he starts to realize he s actually getting sick i start to cough and a fever and tired so he leaves and texts his wife that he s going to go to new jersey where his mom has a house his mom s away and he doesn t want to come home and get his wife and the baby sick because of my daughter when i went home she always hugged me and kissed me and she will catch it and what s running through his head at this moment is he thinking i have a bad cough i might have the flu is coronavirus even on his mind not really i mean there had not been a single case in all of new jersey he thought he probably had the flu by then he was mostly feeling this bad cough he had an elevated heart rate his eyes were really runny he had diarrhea he was not feeling well at all but he also was not alarmed you know he decided to go to one of those drop in centers to get a flu test because he wanted to be told he didn t have the flu so he could go home so the doctor gives him a strep test and a flu test they discuss whether he should get a coronavirus test in fact but the doctor didn t have one so they moved on and the results came back that although the strep and the flu tests were negative his symptoms were consistent with something called a pulmonary embolism which is a clot in your lung that can be fatal so this could potentially be even more serious than just a seasonal flu or yes certainly more serious than the flu so after i went direct to the hackensack emergency room so the doctor sends him to the e r at the hackensack university medical center which is not far from that doctor s office and in the emergency room they asked me questions asked me if i cough i said i do i do have cough i do have shortness of breath so as called for the doctors do a ct scan and after they do they realize that no he does not have a pulmonary embolism but that in fact because of the symptoms he s having and the way his lungs look in the scan they see a ground glass nodules so this can be coronavirus he might actually have coronavirus and how do the doctors at this hospital react to that well at this point they haven t seen any coronavirus patients so they don t seem to him terribly alarmed that said they do put him in a tiny isolation room a windowless room on the floor of the emergency room that s where he spends the night texting his friends and his wife and getting increasingly unnerved and feeling quite ill i was nervous and at the same time since i m in the hospital i m going to check everything make sure i m ok and then i go home so then on tuesday march 3 which is the second day in the hospital they decide to do a test on me so the test takes about 24 hours or 48 hours they do a covid 19 test and they tell him he s going to have to wait a few days for the result but he shouldn t worry he s young and healthy at the same time he s wildly googling symptoms for covid 19 and realizing that he has almost every one of them i had maybe lied to myself was like trying to calm myself down i don t have the covid 19 i shouldn t have it and so it s day three for james in the hospital it s wednesday march 4 he s still waiting for the results in his tiny little room with a tv and sound of local news theme a local news report comes on we we begin tonight with breaking news regarding the coronavirus yeah that virus arriving in the garden state tonight governor phil murphy announcing the first presumptive positive case of the virus right here in new jersey and the news report says a man in his thirties is hospitalized in bergen county there s a guy in his thirties in bergen county which is where he is who s tested positive for coronavirus it s the first case in new jersey governor murphy saying there s even a tweet from the governor of new jersey confirming it we take this situation very seriously and have been preparing for this for weeks i urge residents to remain calm and it occurs to james they really might be talking about him and then i asked the doctor saying is this me and the doctor s saying no your test is not back yet and of course he hasn t heard anything about the results of his test yet no he has not heard anything wow so you found out from the news from the governor of new jersey yes on tv and i asked the doctor the doctor say the result is not back yet and then the next day his doctors come to him and say yes you have tested positive and he is the first person in new jersey to have tested positive for covid 19 right and perhaps the first person in the history of the universe to find out he has a disease not from his doctor but from tv news let s hope so and how does the hospital react in this moment so he s really scared but the hospital is telling him that he really has nothing to worry about he s a 32 year old guy he s got no preexisting conditions even dr inaudible was telling me oh you re so young it s like a flu in fact one doctor even told him if it s not because everybody is talking about corona you can go home already you know if it weren t for all this attention about the coronavirus you d be home right now just getting better in the comfort of your own bedroom in other words it would probably just self resolve in somebody of his health that was definitely the expectation i mean that day i was so depressed i think he felt that as a medical professional he actually he knew that he was quite vulnerable that nobody was invulnerable and there was this disconnect between his own concerns and their own insistence that he was overly anxious america is not ready it also dawns on him that he is the first person in this hospital to be treated for coronavirus i feel like i m in real trouble why i come to this hospital because i feel they don t know how to treat this disease and they don t have deep understanding about this disease nobody there has any experience nobody there can make good predictions nobody there has institutional knowledge about what happens when this goes wrong or something unexpected happens he s the first person and that s a very frightening position to be in we ll be right back so sue james is newly diagnosed he s in isolation at this hospital in hackensack new jersey he s been there for about four days physically how is he doing at this point when you first got the results of the positive test on a scale of 1 to 10 how bad did you feel physically 10 being the worst i would say 10 wow he is feeling worse by the day getting worse so my heart is compensating beating very fast he definitely has that cough and he also is having real trouble breathing it s like i m in the water tell me more about that it s like normally we can just take very deep breaths in and out he describes it as that feeling when you re underwater and you have to come up to gasp for breath but you can t quite get that oxygen that you want and it s very panicking feeling it s a very scary feeling so my lung is not allowing me to take deep breaths and how is the hospital treating him now that he s officially tested positive they move him to a room with certain protections in place and they re keeping an eye on his numbers and they re giving him oxygen when he needs it and he s also keeping an eye on his numbers and he s worried because he is not breathing well and on friday march 6 his fifth day in the hospital he worries that he is desaturating to a dangerous level and i desats he desats you desaturated and what does that mean to desaturate it means that when you desaturate below a certain level your blood is not getting enough oxygen from your lungs for you to function in a normal healthy way and this is really concerning to him you have pneumonia it s normal just use oxygen but he still has the sense that the hospital is telling him he s overreacting that he s being too anxious he s going to recover just fine i was confused and also i was worried because i think i m not getting enough care and my oxygen level dropped and they they cannot even see it and why do you think people in hospital are saying that and maybe more importantly why are they thinking that why are they insisting on being so calm about what it would mean to have an infection like this i would have to guess that it s because the widespread impression that people had was that young people were not going to be terribly affected by this virus and that it was going to feel like a very very bad flu and that he was going to recover just fine just like the statistics supposedly said he was going to and did you actually feel yourself having difficulty breathing at that point i just feel tightness tightness in your chest i feel like a very scary very scared and i don t know what to do next and james is all too aware that no one in that hospital has ever treated anyone with coronavirus and he s really worried about his symptoms because he knows he s feeling worse and worse every day so i told my cousin i told everybody and they just start searching so he starts reaching out to friends of his who are plugged into the chinese medical community including his best friend who s a physician and whom he calls his cousin and his boss and they start making phone calls and trying to get information from experienced people who can maybe share what they ve learned which is what you know there s advice that he should get high doses of vitamin c there s some discussion of whether he should get a steroid treatment if things get worse he translate the seventh edition they say that maybe he wants to look into antiviral medication they tell him he shouldn t wait too long before getting a second ct scan but his doctors were really reluctant to do that why was that they felt like they were giving him good care and that probably the results of the ct scan would not change that so james is more or less beginning to advise his own doctors on how to treat him based on his research based on his relationship with other medical professionals which is pretty unusual yes very unusual and then the evening of the 7th he starts desaturating to a level that really scares him he s concerned that if he desaturates to a certain degree there could be no turning back he d have to be intubated which definitely increases you know all of the risks of the illness it would mean that a machine was going be doing all the breathing for him it could lead to organ failure and in some cases of course death and i mean if i intubated at night i probably would just die by myself alone without seeing the loved ones and his friends also some of them see this real urgency to save his life and you know one of his friends said to me that he personally felt responsible for making sure that the doctors took james s case as seriously as possible here he is he s the first health care worker in new jersey also to come down with covid 19 if he didn t make it it was going to feel like the battle was over before it had even begun you always live in fear that you re never going to wake up and also in isolation and nobody can see you so it s very miserable if people die think about it people die and they cannot see their loved ones what i mean like i feel like it s very tough right for somebody to die alone you were scared i mean you were probably too weak to really speak forcefully but you were letting them know that you felt that your life was on the line at this point yeah and we don t exactly know why but on the 8th he did get that second ct scan and it come back very bad it s bad he has pneumonia in both lungs 30 to 40 percent of his lungs seem to be affected that s astonishing that it would go from a small spot just a few days earlier to where it is now and if he had gotten that bad in three days or four days since the last ct scan how much worse was he going to be in another four days and now james starts to worry that he really might not survive this i was praying to everybody to god to buddha to everybody saying don t let me die when i know my oxygen levels keep desaturating one of my requests is can i see my mother and my wife or my daughter for the last time it was that time when my chest x rays show so bad and my oxygen level every day is dropping and i would tell them that i have to be strong but i don t know how many days i can live and the good thing is after the ct they listened when she saw second ct she was like ok we have to treat you i spoke to a doctor at the hospital who was part of the team overseeing his care and he said they d been looking at the whole clinical picture had recognized that he was declining even before the ct scan but from james s point of view everything changed after the scan he feels like now they re taking this very seriously and they re listening to him they re coming around to seeing just how serious it is and also recognizing that yes even a young person can get very very sick with coronavirus and they re willing to try something and at this stage what is he asking them to do so then a doctor in china recommend a high flow machine james wants a few different types of treatment he s been advised that the doctors should try providing him a more intensive form of oxygen therapy and he wants to go on three experimental antiviral medications kaletra chloroquine and remdesivir and at this point he and the doctors at hackensack and all the other doctors he s working with are pretty much all on the same page he finally gets the main things he s been asking for and i think the next day dr inaudible came in he said the medication s here we re going to give it to you and finally after more than a week in the hospital james starts to turn around he does start to feel better so after the first day my fever finally dropped and my oxygen stopped dropping i m getting better and better every day so that s the whole thing and does he have a sense do you have a sense do his doctors have a sense of which of these treatments was responsible for that not really i mean it might have been any one of the drugs or all of the drugs or the oxygen or some combination of that or he might have just gotten better on his own we really don t know and so i asked you how you felt on a scale of 1 to 10 10 being the worst when you first got the results of the test and you said that you were a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 how do you feel now i would say now maybe 3 that s pretty good yeah because i feel like all the symptoms have gone i mean i will be maybe no worry if tests come back negative then i know the virus is dead now i don t know if it is dead or not it s now 10 37 and i need you to get a good night s sleep so i m going to call you in the morning and see how your oxygen level were is that ok yes ok thank you all right thanks james bye bye good night bye bye sue it feels correct me if i m wrong like a big reason why james survived was because he was such an aggressive advocate for himself and he had this network of expertise that he could tap into he himself was a medical professional and that that put him in a very strong position but i wonder why the people around him in this hospital were not better prepared given the stage of this pandemic when he arrived in hackensack we don t really know what saved his life because these drugs are still in clinical trials what we do know is that the entire story of coronavirus in this country is a story of lack of preparation people did not believe that it simply was never going to be as bad here as it was in wuhan or milan that is a universal story it was hardly just these doctors at this hospital i mean part of it is that they are busy people they are moving things really quickly they are saving lives every day in fact we all know that they re saving lives and putting their own lives on the line right now but also it is just hard to put yourself back in that moment march 1 march 2 or the end of february and remember how unlikely we all still hoped and believed against all evidence that this wasn t going to be devastating here the way it was elsewhere right that said to their credit the doctors at this hospital were open minded and they were flexible and they were nimble and they were willing to try whatever they could that was safe when they realized that whatever they had been doing definitely was not working and i know james feels really appreciative ultimately he sent out a tweet that expressed his gratitude for the hospital saving as he sees it his life sue what do you think the lesson of this story is of james his very unique situation in these early days of the pandemic in the united states and of what happened to him at this hospital one of the things that i m hearing from doctors is that until you are in this moment and experiencing the onslaught of patients it is very hard to imagine it you can t really know until you re actually living it and you know every hospital in this country is likely to have its james it s going to have that first patient who comes in who is really ill they re not exactly sure how to treat it we still really don t know how best to treat this virus that is the hard cold truth of it there are some protocols that we hope will help that are thought might help but it s unclear it s so new and it s going to be really hard for all those hospitals and they re going to have to make difficult choices they re going to have to make complicated ethical choices they re going to have to make decisions on the fly and build up their clinical experience and it s not going to be easy for any of them sue how is james doing at this point i don t know when the last time it was that you spoke with him but what did he tell you he s home he is still in quarantine so he still has not been able to see his wife or daughter and his lungs are still recovering it s unclear just how fully they will recover you know it s definitely a long road ahead of him and at the same time you know he s reading the news and he is feeling so lucky lucky to be alive to be alive thank you sue thank you michael hello hi james it s sue how are you doing i m good are you actually in your own home yes how does it feel it feels great i m going to sleep on my own bed fantastic once i m out of the hospital i feel like i m alive i feel like everything is so new to me the grass trees cars new people face the sky and then when i drive on the road i appreciate every building every people i see i feel like it s a second chance to live again to be alive what is the first thing you re going to say to your daughter and wife when you finally get to see them in person i know you re quarantining for almost two more weeks now yes so when i see my daughter and my wife i definitely will give them big hugs try to don t let them go i maybe will like have my daughter in my arms all the time i will come home and spend every minute with my family appreciate every day living all right good night have a great night s sleep thanks james thank you thank you for checking in on me my pleasure bye goodbye bye bye we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today in interviews on sunday members of the president s coronavirus task force delivered dire warnings about the pandemic s projected path in the united states no state no metro area will be spared and the sooner we react and the sooner the states and the metro areas react and ensure that they put in full mitigation at the same time understanding exactly what their hospitals need then we ll be able to move forward together and protect the most americans speaking to nbc news dr deborah birx said that the white house was asking every state to prepare for the kind of outbreak now occurring in new york where there are about 60 000 infections well dr birx said yesterday as you know that she doesn t think any city will be spared from this virus how many cases do you think the u s will reach i mean looking at what we re seeing now you know i would say between 100 and 200 000 cases excuse me deaths but i just don t think that we really need to make a projection when it s such a
