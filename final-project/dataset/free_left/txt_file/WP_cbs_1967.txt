watch cbsn live by musadiq bidar updated on may 9 2020 12 25 pm cbs news california governor gavin newsom on friday signed an executive order to ensure every registered voter in the state is automatically mailed a ballot for the november presidential election the executive order does not replace in person voting newsom said during a press conference mail in ballot is important but it s not an exclusive substitute to physical locations newsom said he added that the state is still working to have the appropriate number of physical sites for people to vote as well secretary of state alex padilla who s been pushing to expand vote by mail called into newsom s press conference and said the executive order makes california the first state in the nation to automatically send voters their ballots ahead of the general election in response to the coronavirus i think that s huge there is no safer physically distancing healthier way to exercise your right to vote than from the safety and convenience of your own home padilla said he added that all return postage for the ballots will be prepaid padilla echoed newsom s remarks that this will not be a vote by mail election only and stressed his commitment to providing as many in person voting sites as possible but he warned there is a shortage of election workers traditional election day volunteers older californians who might be retired fall into the high risk category we need people who are willing and able and healthy to help us out on election day and the early voting time period padilla said local counties have until the end of this month to provide the state with clarity on their plans for in person voting requirements newsom said if those plans are not in by may 30 a second executive order might be needed to resolve issues the concept of mail in voting has been at the forefront of the debate over how to proceed with november s presidential election while dealing with a public health pandemic four states already conduct their general elections by mail and hawaii will become the fifth state to move in that direction this year another 28 states and washington d c offer no excuse absentee or mail voting according to the national conference of state legislatures last month padilla told cbs newsthat most states already have some capacity for vote by mail elections but election officials from both parties were sounding the alarm about the need for more resources to ensure health safety and expand alternatives to in person and day of voting they also anticipated protracted partisan fights over what the general election could and should look like amid coronavirus the republican national committee which has been pushing back against a widespread vote by mail system said friday it is weighing our legal options in response to newsom s order while we have always supported absentee voting california is a case study in why automatically sending this many ballots is a problem rnc spokesman michael ahrens said in a statement at the national level president trump is leading the charge against vote by mail mr trump has alleged people cheat with vote by mail ballots and has it a corrupt practice on saturday mr trump weighed in on twitter tying the mail in ballot order to a new voting center that opened in california s 25th district where a special election will take place on may 12 so in california the democrats who fought like crazy to get all mail in only ballots and succeeded have just opened a voting booth in the most democrat area in the state they are trying to steal another election it s all rigged out there these votes must not count scam mr trump wrote in a statement to cbs news on friday trump campaign communications director tim murtaugh said newsom is looking to undermine election security calling the executive order a thinly veiled political tactic murtaugh argued that sending everyone a ballot even those who don t want one creates a wide open opportunity for fraud everyone is concerned about the safety of voters but jeopardizing election security is the wrong way to go about it national republican congressional committee chair tom emmer also came out with a statement slamming newsom alleging the governor continues to dodge questions about ballot harvesting posing an immediate threat to public health california already allows vote by mail but voters have to specifically make a request for the ballot this executive order padilla said will make it so that voters automatically get a ballot without have to put in an official request registered voters currently living in california will receive a ballot 29 days prior to election day military members and voters living abroad will get their ballots in the mail 45 days before election day nicole sganga contributed reporting first published on may 8 2020 8 24 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know get the latest breaking news delivered straight to
