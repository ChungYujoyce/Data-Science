with supporters and arriving on stage 2 soundbite english hillary clinton democratic presidential candidate with your help we re going to come back to philadelphia for the democratic national convention with the most votes and the most pledged delegates by amy chozick and alexander burns philadelphia after months of trying to sideline an unexpectedly deft and well financed liberal opponent hillary clinton on tuesday won a series of primaries that freed her to present herself as the de facto victor of the democratic nominating fight and gave her the impetus to shift focus decisively toward the november election now all but certain to clinch her party s nomination mrs clinton will continue to face the criticism of her party rival senator bernie sanders of vermont but she is expected to move swiftly to claim an early advantage against the leading republican candidate donald j trump her advisers and allies say she will spend the coming weeks honing her message for the general election and stepping up fund raising that has lagged in the face of mr sanders s challenge with your help we re going to come back to philadelphia for the democratic national convention with the most votes and the most pledged delegates mrs clinton told a crowd of 1 300 here after she took the stage to eye of the tiger and we will unify our party to win this election and build an america where we can all rise together after a landslide win in new york last week mrs clinton had already begun to treat mr sanders as a greatly diminished threat concentrating her fire on mr trump and to a lesser degree senator ted cruz of texas her victories in pennsylvania maryland connecticut and delaware on tuesday will only accelerate that shift in recent days she has sharpened her pitch about the general election s stakes heading off republican attacks on her record as secretary of state under president obama and delivering a more forceful message about the economy and the need to create jobs and lift wages imagine a tomorrow where hard work is honored families are supported streets are safe and communities are strong and where love trumps hate mrs clinton said tuesday night drawing applause at her play on mr trump s name mrs clinton is not expected to publicly pressure mr sanders to quit the race clinton advisers say any efforts to muscle him out could backfire angering his supporters and mr sanders both of which mrs clinton praised tuesday night for challenging us to get unaccountable money out of our politics but a super pac supporting mrs clinton s candidacy priorities usa action may start running general election ads even before the nominating contest ends guy cecil the group s chief strategist said the group might run ads against mr trump or mr cruz depending on how the republican primary develops and whether they decide to launch attacks against hillary in coming weeks mrs clinton will campaign in states with looming primaries but she will also recharge and spend time in new york plotting a general election strategy with advisers she needs to be smart and calculated and prepare herself for a tough general election and knowing her she will be said thomas r nides a friend and adviser who worked for mrs clinton at the state department after months of focus on the 2 383 delegates needed for the democratic party nomination her campaign has begun to analyze the electoral college working out potential races against mr trump and mr cruz and the campaign will begin polling in traditional battleground states like ohio and florida but it will also pore over data in traditionally republican states like arizona north carolina and georgia that could be in play particularly if mr trump is the nominee and focus on demographics beyond the democratic primary electorate realistically the most important part in all of this are white working class women said geoff garin a pollster and strategist on mrs clinton s 2008 campaign who is now advising priorities citing mrs clinton s emphasis on issues like equal pay for women and an increase in the minimum wage 10 photos view slide show senator chris murphy of connecticut who campaigned alongside mrs clinton in his state said she must focus on how best to connect to a broader electorate that is in what he called a revolutionary mood alluding to how mr sanders has energized supporters you are not going to win this general election by proposing incremental changes mr murphy said adding that he hoped mrs clinton doesn t shy away from proposing some big ideas to try to reorder the country to the benefit of those that are hurting mr sanders s campaign vowed tuesday to remain in the fight through the california primary on june 7 and perhaps until the party s convention in july as word of mrs clinton s victories rolled in on tuesday night he gave a defiant speech in west virginia predicting he would win the state when it votes may 10 mrs clinton who doggedly remained in the 2008 primary contest against barack obama until june despite his insurmountable delegate lead and democratic calls for her to bow out has said she will not call on mr sanders to withdraw but she has bristled at the implication that he could overcome her big leads in both pledged delegates and the popular vote mrs clinton s aides and allies are pressuring mr sanders to run on issues rather than continuing to attack mrs clinton s ties to wall street or her previous support for global trade deals attacks that republicans are likely to use in the fall if he tones down the rhetoric and continues to fight he ll go out on a very high note with a lot of people including me thinking he did a great service to american democracy said edward g rendell a former pennsylvania governor who supports mrs clinton but if he keeps it up it could be brutal mr sanders whose sole win on tuesday came in rhode island did not attack mrs clinton directly in his remarks on tuesday night but argued insistently that he would be a superior general election candidate as voters went to the polls earlier in the day the sanders campaign sent out a fund raising email with an image of mrs clinton and her husband bill clinton at mr trump s 2005 wedding and accused clinton allies of being traitors in their treatment of mr sanders still tad devine a senior adviser to mr sanders on tuesday said that the campaign would not mislead voters about his chances at winning the nomination if we are sitting here and there s no sort of mathematical way to do it we will be upfront about that he said democrats supporting mrs clinton have pointed to senators harry reid of nevada elizabeth warren of massachusetts and chuck schumer of new york as potential peacemakers should the sanders campaign keep up its pointed attacks on mrs clinton i m going to be optimistic and say it won t be necessary but all of us are friends with bernie and we d pick up the phone and talk to him at any time said senator claire mccaskill a democrat from missouri who is supporting mrs clinton but mrs clinton would do well to begin building bridges to mr sanders said david axelrod a former senior strategist for the obama campaign it seems certain bernie will run through the last primaries which is inconvenient and costly he said still when you re the winner you can afford to be big and hillary should advertisement
