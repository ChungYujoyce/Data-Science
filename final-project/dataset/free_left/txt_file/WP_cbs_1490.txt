benson michael morell robert thanks for joining us it s great to have you on intelligence matters robert worth it s a pleasure to be here michael morell robert as you know i read your piece in the new york times sunday magazine i think it was january 9th on mohammed bin zayed who we all affectionately call mbz and we can do that throughout this piece and i read it with great interest i ve known mbz for many years and i think this is the first profile that i ve ever seen of him number one and number two i think you did a terrific job capturing him so i wanted to have you on the podcast to talk about him because i think he is an important and an extraordinary person so maybe the place to start is to ask you why you wrote the piece in the first place why d you want to do this robert worth well i had heard a lot about mbz over the years he s someone who is very well known to policy makers as you know he keeps a low profile though so ordinary people really haven t heard much about him i think part of that is because he s not the official ruler of the uae his brother remains the titular president but he s really been exercising the levers of power there for many years and he s a sophisticated thinker i mean that s one of the first things that people will tell you who knew him well you know former heads of state and so forth who often to go to see him and seek his advice military leaders a number of them had told me including general mattis i hope he doesn t mind me saying that know him well and respect his judgement and then secondly i wrote a book about the arab spring and its consequences and i was very interested in the role of the uae specifically mbz who guided those efforts in what happened there he and let s say the emirates and the saudis are often portrayed as the bad guys of the arab spring as the sort of autocrats who snuffed out of the hopes of arab democrats michael morell right right robert worth and i had a feeling it was much more complicated and i wanted to get a better understanding of how they saw all of those events michael morell yeah well i was one of those government officials who found him and still find him to be a very sophisticated thinker and someone who i always found great value in sitting down with and having a conversation about almost anything so i m not surprised you heard that from many people why do you think they decided to cooperate with you because they ve been so reluctant to let him talk to a journalist for example and you had the opportunity to interview him why do you think they did that robert worth i think it s a couple reasons i think one they were independently i think moving closer towards being a little more transparent he s made more head of state visits to places he s sort of come out a bit as being the decision maker in the emirates and also i had lobbied them over some time and i think the fact that i had written quite a bit about the gulf over many years may have made a difference and then finally i wrote a story that came out in in 2018 about a big ransom a group of qataris who were falcon hunting in iraq and were captured and then there was an enormous and complicated ransom michael morell captured by robert worth captured by a shiite militia iran played a big role in all of this and i wrote a long story about how that happened which to be pretty frank about it made qatar look bad now as you know the emirates is in a big big feud with qatar and i think that may inadvertently have endeared me to the emirati leadership michael morell so i think it was robert one of the first two paragraphs of your piece that you called mbz one of the most powerful men on earth that s a quote why robert worth well if you just look at the moment you know the sovereign wealth funds of the emirates they re tremendous more than 1 3 trillion he s also developed a small but very sophisticated and efficient military really as far as i understand probably the best trained special forces apart from israel in the middle east michael morell i think that s right yeah robert worth and he s deployed them so he has the levers of power in several different ways and also because unlike some other countries he really along with his brothers is in charge can make independent decisions without having to worry too much about domestic audience since it s a very small country so for all those reasons i think he just sort of stands out michael morell okay so for our listeners let me ask you some questions about him personally who is he from a family pedigree perspective robert worth sure he is the son of the founder of the united arab emirates the country was founded in 1971 and his father sheikh zayed al nahyan is just a legendary huge figure really i think universally respected in the middle east because no one thought that country would really come together it was a group of sheikhdoms on the north side of the arabian coast of arabian peninsula and they were fractious and there was a history of fighting even within some of those sheikhdoms including abu dhabi which is the largest and that s the one mbz comes from but sheikh zayed was a very charismatic very wise character who managed to pull them all together and then of course used the tremendous oil money they had wisely and they built this incredible example of a peaceful and very developed country michael morell and then you said his brother is actually the leader and he s got a couple roles right he s the crown prince of abu dhabi and he s also the defense minister of the entire country so how is it that he essentially becomes the leader of the whole place robert worth well his brother sheikh khalifa had a stroke years back and so was really out of commission the titles that they have the leaders of the different emirates are a little out of whack with their actual responsibilities so for instance many people are more familiar with sheikh mohammed who s the ruler of dubai one of the other seven emirates but abu dhabi has always been by far the richest and just in geography it s by far the largest of the emirates and so that automatically gave its leader a greater share of power and then finally i think there s a kind of complex internal process in which people are sifted out and it s not exactly democracy but there s a kind of collective judgement on who is most fit to run the place and i think for a number of years it s been clear both to outsiders and inside the emirates that sheikh mohammed was the guy michael morell a little bit about his background where he went to school jobs he had in the runup to his current roles robert worth sure so when he was fairly young when he was a teenager his father sent him to morocco where he lived and studied and even worked briefly in a restaurant i think his father wanted to move him away from a place where he was seen as this sort of unintel you know the heir apparent or one of the heirs apparent and to toughen him up a bit and i think that worked he lived a pretty simple life he studied there he later went to a famously tough boarding school in england where prince charles and other royals had gone and then he went to sandhurst the british military academy and then he returned to the uae where he followed a military path learned how to fly was an officer progressed through the ranks and eventually became the leader of the uae s military michael morell so how would you describe him as a person you spent some time with him how would you describe him robert worth yeah you know i ve met a number of heads of state and what s interesting is that when you sit down with him you don t see that sense sort of how to put it pr antenna that you see with a lot of heads of state who are sort of conscious always of how they sound and looking around they re seeing who the audience is and so forth he sits down looks at you you have this sense of a private conversation he s very deliberate soft spoken analytical there s something a little bit almost professorial about him he s charming too he s funny i mean i think i mentioned in the story his accent is maybe slightly british but his vocabulary is definitely american you know he ll say things like come on guys let s do this let s not do this whatever so and he loves to surprise people he clearly has a sense of humor about that sort of playing off the image of the ruler he loves to be informal take you out for a walk to show up in the helicopter that he s flying instead of someone else michael morell there s a humility about him too right robert worth there is yeah yeah compared with some arab rulers potentate sheikhs whatever that you come across he doesn t present himself that way and i suppose that may be partly character and partly a legacy of his father who was famously humble in the way that he approached people it s also partly by calculation i mean people revere that quality in him michael morell i wonder if his time in morocco instilled some of that in him as well robert worth i don t know yeah it s possible and again i think that s part of the legacy of his father he was very conscious i think early on of the danger of the oil money making a generation of spoiled brats who hadn t earned anything on their own and i think his father wanted to prevent that from happening to him michael morell you talk about surprises and informality the first time that i went to the emirates after i retired he asked to see and a car was sent to pick me up and i was taken to a small restaurant and i had no idea where i was going but this small restaurant where he was doing his meetings that day not in some palace but in a restaurant so he is absolutely what you said he was how did you find him as an interview subject robert worth well i should say i only spent an hour with him i first met him with one of the surprises i was attending an iftar during ramadan an evening breaking of the fast meal and he just to my complete surprise walked up behind me and sort of tapped me on the shoulder and brought me in and sat me down next to him so we spoke a little bit then during the interview i mean he was a great subject he answered my questions and then he went off sometimes in slight digressions which ended up being tremendously helpful for me because they were full of rich anecdote and he didn t hold back you know he said some things that maybe he didn t want to be ultimately quoted on michael morell so how would you robert describe his world view his mindset his vision this is the heart of your piece right robert worth sure yeah i think you could compare him a little bit to lee kuan yew he wants to further develop the country which after all was initially developed by his father and he wants to i think make emiratis more disciplined education is immensely important probably the most important thing to him he wants to extend that that s what he s worked so hard with nyu and other educational institutions he s brought there and i think his vision of the emirates and the arab world s future is well first of all it s not democratic we should say that right out although it does have its own sort of how to put it certain forms of accountability in which people can bring concerns to the ruling family and i don t think he would use this word but i think at least in relative terms in the arab world it s a secular vision he does not want to see political islam taking over that region and i think he s immensely immensely concerned about that he s seen what s happened in the past few decades what happened starting in iran with the islamic revolution there what happened with successive waves in the sunni arab world what happened in saudi arabia which is right next door and was a huge concern for him he did not want to see that kind of wahhabi extremism take over and he s worked very hard to stop it michael morell has this vision been a constant for him for a long period of time or has he grown into this do you think robert worth i think he s grown to it and after all i should say he was an islamist in his thinking as a young man so many people in this generation were it was partly because his own father unwittingly had put a guy in charge of his son s education who was himself a muslim brotherhood member an egyptian living in the emirates and he was under the sway of that thinking for several years and then he at some point decided in the early 80s that it was completely irreconcilable with the kind of the country he was growing up in and with the kind of ruling system it had and so i think over time as he saw how powerful the islamist thought was in the region he began to develop a stronger desire to push back against it michael morell so you tell a story in the piece about a conversation that he had with his father right after 9 11 can you tell that story robert worth sure this is when he went to his father and said this must have been i guess october 2011 he said the americans are going into afghanistan and his father sheikh zayed was quite an old man said well we have to be there with them we need to be fighting alongside them and mbz wasn t quite prepared for this and he said well how i do sell this i mean after all this would mean muslims killing muslims which is going to look bad and his father then said so tell me do you like the quran the hadith you know the son of the prophet and of course mbz yes of course and he said do you think that this guy out there osama bin laden in the mountains is living according to our religion and mbz said no absolutely not and he said you re right our religion is being hijacked michael morell and he ultimately takes on that view correct robert worth yes yes yes and he told me that that really stuck with him michael morell you mentioned kind of lee kuan yew of the middle east do you think he thinks about it that way does he have a role model in his mind robert worth i don t think so he certainly never mentioned lee kuan yew that was my thought i think actually sheikh mohammed the ruler of dubai who after all got more attention earlier i think for the way that he developed dubai and did this very flashy both tourist and economic michael morell kind of disneyland feel to it robert worth disney exactly kind of a crazy disneyland and i think he has mentioned lee kuan yew as a kind of role model i think for mbz it s less about being an economic hub after all abu dhabi is really more the capital it s more involved in political and financial military decisions but i think he does want to build a place that is where more or less secular values are being promoted where he wants to build a future beyond oil and he s worked very hard on that that s one of the things that doesn t get talked about much but he created this alternative sovereign wealth fund mubadala that has worked very hard at creating alternatives to oil michael morell so robert he s deeply concerned about political islam and i think he would argue that more open democracies in the middle east are more vulnerable to it and you need a more authoritarian state to take it on and that s that convenient argument for him right but do you think at the end of the day you know the region well do you think that argument is right robert worth that s a very tough question and i think it really depends on the particular country when i look at the countries in the middle east today i take great hope in looking at tunisia which as you know is a democracy now it s still troubled it s still got a very weak economy but you do have a balance there between the relatively moderate liberal islamist party and the principle secular party but i think that s because tunisia was in a very different condition from just about every other country in the region for the rest of them unfortunately the nominally democratic republics that emerged after the second world war have just been catastrophic and we saw what happened i was living in iraq after the american invasion when this rapid introduction of american style elections really seemed to make the country more unstable and violent and helped to propel it into a civil war so i think that for a lot of those countries some sort of benign autocracy may be the best way towards a more democratic future michael morell so i want to ask you robert about his views of his relationships with the other players in the region and maybe the place to start is us the united states how does he think about us and i ll start by saying i ve gotten earfuls over the years about u s policy so i ll put that on the table robert worth sure yeah i can imagine well i mean first of all the first thing to say is that there s a deep relationship his father was very much in favor of a strong relationship with the united states and towards the west in general you know at a time when and remember zayed founded the country in 1971 when anti imperialism was running very strong arab nationalism was very strong there were countries that were nationalizing their oil and zayed s attitude was no these people have the skills and the education and the wherewithal to help us and we need to be friends with them and so mbz when he was growing up absorbed that point of view worked very closely as a military officer and later as the defense minister working with the pentagon but i think he was also anxious about what came to be called the democracy agenda he felt that the united states should continue to value stability more in the region and that promoting elections often meant being blind to the circumstances of those countries i mean he saw what happened in hamas with the elections there in 2006 michael morell right robert worth i think they were very anxious about the american invasion of iraq in the first place i think they would have probably preferred to have if it were necessary in the first place to invade to simply decapitate the regime and put a more palatable figure in charge but not to change the system michael morell right what about the saudis and you mentioned a little bit of concern about wahhabism and the spread of it but his relationship with mohammed bin salman the crown prince of saudi arabia how does he think about that robert worth you know i think saudi arabia was maybe in some ways the biggest foreign concern for mbz for many years just because it was right next door it was so powerful so rich and i think the feeling sort of was we have to help the saudis help themselves because the leadership there was feckless he would never say that of course i think when he saw mbs come along and he had actually even under late in the reign of king abdullah there had been a recognition and a feeling that they could work together so it started then but when he saw mbs he thought okay this is a young guy who s got bold ideas for reform which were patterned i think in large measure on the uae and what mbz had done and he said you know this guy may be young impetuous he may have made mistakes but he s headed in the right direction we really need to encourage him and he told his american counterparts you guys should get on board i don t think he believed that the united states would be able to make that decision about who would be the next ruler michael morell right robert worth you know that s a decision that s made in saudi arabia michael morell right robert worth but what he did say was please get to know this guy michael morell so he actually has mentored mbs a bit robert worth yes he has i think the trouble there is that nobody wants to admit that for various reasons the saudis see themselves as the big gorilla in the region michael morell the big boys on the block yep robert worth right they re in charge right and even though mbz is older than mbs if there s a mentoring relationship they don t want to present it that way and the emirates for the same reason doesn t want to get out of line they re keen to present themselves as an assisting partner michael morell but it would certainly i would say be in our interest for him to be mentoring mbs that would be actually a good thing robert worth exactly well i certainly heard a lot of talk about that especially after the gruesome murder of jamal khashoggi who i knew personally and i think there was a feeling of who is going to do it who is going to coach this guy who is going to i mean i ve called michael morell who s going to tell him you can t do this sort of thing robert worth exactly right i mean if we can t get rid of him and replace him with someone else which after all is a very perilous enterprise and probably beyond our powers who is going to help him change and a lot of people would say well the only person in a position to do that is mbz i m not sure mbz is in the position to do that though because especially now that mbs has been in place for a number of years he sees himself as the main guy michael morell the iranians how does he think about the iranians robert worth i think as we said earlier that iran since 79 has been a tremendous concern for the emiratis a feeling that right next door they have this radical revolutionary power and there were times well for many years i should say they would encourage i think somewhat irresponsibly they would encourage the united states to be more aggressive with iran without really adequately recognizing or understanding how dangerous that would be for them after all they re the first line of defense they re right across unintel you can practically see iran from the uae coastline and i think they ve recently become more realistic about that not just because of trump and after all under obama they felt that obama was kind of throwing them out to the winds and sort of leaving them to iran s mercies but then they ve seen that trump who they initially welcomed as someone who was going to be a tougher opponent of iran is actually very unpredictable you know that he s made these gestures he assassinated qasem soleimani and other times he seems to be saying sort it out yourselves i want to pull my forces out of this region it s not my problem and so they have now undertaken and i think they pioneered this and the saudis followed a sort of quiet diplomacy with iran in an effort to make sure that at least they are not targeted if there s a war i mean that may be impossible i think and i hope they recognize that s impossible you know the notion that you can cut yourself out of a war is unrealistic michael morell particularly when you have a u s military base sitting there robert worth exactly exactly it s not going to work michael morell how do you think he sees russian and chinese attempts to gain some influence in the region robert worth i think he sees russia and china as important powers that he needs he needs to balance his relationship with the united states with these guys he sees that russia for years now has worked hard to play a powerful role in syria and elsewhere russia s really all over the place in the region it wants to be a power broker and i think with russia my sense is that his principle goal is to pull russia away from iran but i think he also figures than he needs to be working with them if they re involved in the region with china it s just a fact of their tremendous economic power in africa to a less extent in the middle east if he doesn t get what he wants from american military suppliers he s long been perfectly willing to deal with the chinese and he sees the belt and road initiative as something he s got to be part of michael morell yeah you know my sense a little bit is that his view of the obama administration not being there for him and the trump administration s unpredictability he has no choice but to hedge a bit right and talk to the russians and talk to the chinese and be more engaged with them it s just reality for him it s real politique for him robert worth yeah absolutely i think he s right about that michael morell so robert mbz made a decision in 2009 around 2009 to pursue a more activist foreign policy why did he do that what were the drivers robert worth i think what really began to move him in that direction i mean he had developed a much stronger military he saw the united states first of all playing a less active role in the region he thought he couldn t rely on them anymore and then when the arab spring happened i think he was very anxious about political islamists taking advantage of that vacuum and he didn t think anyone else was going to play that role there was an important meeting i don t think i mentioned this in the story but a meeting of the friends of syria group i think in istanbul and around 2012 2013 at which there was a discussion about the syrian rebels and who to back and the foreign minister mbz s brother abdullah bin zayed said look we re getting concerned a lot of these rebels are very very islamist you know we re going to end up repeating what happened in afghanistan here and the turkish and qatari foreign minister said no no no no no we can t worry about that these guys are the best fighters we ve just got to back them and then when it s all done when asaad s out we ll figure out the rest and abdullah bin zayed abz as he s known was horrified but also horrified that john kerry who was there and listening to this did not step in did not say anything and that moment was later described to me by mbz and others as an important moment when they realized wait a minute something s going on here no one is recognizing how dangerous this is michael morell what are some of the examples of the more activist foreign policy that they ve pursued robert worth well first of all they were very much involved i think in what happened in egypt in 2013 when mohamed morsi the democratic elected president was overthrown and replaced by the military and now we have sisi who in many ways has been a pretty disastrous figure michael morell not a bastion of dem he s not thomas jefferson robert worth that s putting it very mild yes and in many ways has been more repressive than mubarak was of course mbz would make the argument and it s impossible to know what if morsi had stayed on and had led a thorough islamization of the state after all demographically and otherwise egypt is the anchor of the arab world that could potentially have been catastrophic and that s the argument they will make so that was i think the first and in many ways the most important intervention mbz was involved in then there was libya where they had been involved along with nato in 2011 but then as libya collapsed and starting in 2013 they got more and more worried and they eventually backed khalifa haftar who was a big enemy of islamists of all stripes and they have given all kinds of military support to him and continue to do so and many people have criticized him heavily for that because after all libya just seems to get worse and worse with the turks backing the other side michael morell right and russians there now robert worth the russians are there many foreign powers michael morell right robert worth and then of course the other big place where he s been involved is yemen where he joined the saudi intervention the war in yemen starting in 2015 which has been a catastrophe for that country i think the emiratis recognized much much earlier than the saudis that this was a very bad situation and they pulled out but it took them a little too long to do that they ve also been involved in the horn of africa the emirates has backed militias in somalia and there again i think much of this has gone badly they ended up in a kind of proxy war with qatar which almost everywhere backs the islamist militias but i should say the emirates also played a very good diplomatic role in the unintel between ethiopia and unintel so not all of their interventions are military and not all of them end up badly michael morell how do you think he assesses how this more activist foreign policy has gone robert worth i think he probably sees yemen as if not a mistake then something that went badly they did try the emiratis tried very hard to create a political solution there they tried to work with unintel who was aligned with the houthis in yemen and they tried to end that war they failed for complicated reasons it s a very messy messy place i think mbz would defend it and say that what s happening now may look bad but that s weighed against a what if weighed against the potential islamization of these countries which could it s true have been catastrophic i mean libya for instance enormous supplies of weaponry and in an important place on the mediterranean coast could have been really dangerous if it had become a theocracy michael morell so he has this fear right of a dark future for the middle east which is leading him to behave the way he does both at home in trying to build a modern society almost liberal modern society and the way he behaves from a foreign policy perspective in the region do you think he s ultimately optimistic about the future of the region or not robert worth i think he is i think he believes he s going to win but i think he believes he has to fight hard in order to do so and some people would say that he s fighting too hard i mean for instance you mentioned he s building a liberal society at home well in certain respects yes he s empowered women he s very much about pluralism you go to the emirates and you see things you don t see in saudi you see hindu temples you see christian churches all that kind of thing but in terms of civil liberties no way i mean that is a surveillance state where you really better not criticize not just the brotherhood but express any serious disagreement with the government everyone is being watched and there s just quite a bit of fear about that in the population michael morell so as a writer i m sure that some things were left on the cutting room floor in your piece was there anything that was taken out that you really wish would have made the cut robert worth well one thing that i find interesting is the way that the embargo with qatar developed you know it s a longstanding thing it has personal elements but i think the most important part is this deep disagreement about the role of political islam and so in 2013 and 2014 there were meetings between the qatari emir and the leaders of the other gulf powers where very very tough confrontational meetings one of them in particular that i got accounts of that i had to take out in 2014 in which the young new emir of qatar was essentially surrounded in a hostile meeting in riyadh and king abdullah kind of read him the riot act and said you re a liar you ve got to sign this paper in which you pledge to change all of your policies and he wouldn t do it and it came to a sort of standstill and then finally mbz sort of whispered to the king and then took the emir of qatar aside and talked to him for 15 minutes in full view of everybody else in the room and managed to persuade him to sign this document that s just one example of the intense rivalries within the gulf that went on that maybe it was a little bit too inside for the american leaders michael morell yeah yeah yeah no it s a great story robert thank you so much for joining us to the listeners you can google robert worth new york times and you ll find a list of all the things that robert has written including this piece and i would urge everybody to go read it robert thank you robert worth it s a pleasure thank you end of transcript first published on february 12 2020 6 18 am 2020 cbs interactive inc all
