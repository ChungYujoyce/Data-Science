illustration by hunter french isolation anxiety cravings not seeing friends worrying about an invisible and deadly disease depriving oneself of immediate gratification surrendering to the sheer magnitude of the situation for many this is a new post covid routine for people with addictions in recovery it s a daily checklist that existed long before this global health crisis did isolation can trigger enough introspection to cut through the carefully placed layers of internal bullshit that allow chaos and addiction to fester but it can also trigger a relapse especially when financial and mental health hang in the balance this tension is inherent in sobriety at the best of times and becomes brutally obvious when self isolation is a matter of life and death the tricky thing about isolation is that the usual checks and balances like aa meetings work or socializing are no longer in place without these outlets so readily available a person in recovery has the freedom to get fucked up by themselves and watch the world burn with relatively little accountability as covid poses a growing mental health threat worldwide cranking up the volume on everything from anxiety to the risk of suicide for many it will be a make or break period in their sobriety we spoke to three people in recovery about what s keeping them alive healthy and sober in a time of unprecedented isolation matiya whose last name we are not using to protect her identity as someone in recovery has been in recovery since 2017 and is confronting the new reality of quarantine with mixed feelings it s not the worst thing because we re so prepared for it in recovery and so used to spending time alone but at the same time it s the worst possible thing for addicts she says after two weeks of isolating it s really easy to slip when no one s around especially for newcomers what usually keeps sober people in check is a combination of internal and external accountability the latter having been seriously disrupted in recent weeks if you re alone and you have nowhere to be then why stay sober matiya says no one s watching no one will know in my experience isolation is the biggest downfall for us because we re not held accountable we get lonely and we lose a sense of community it s easy to slip when no one s around it s really scary right now for a lot of people in recovery scary because for matiya whose drugs of choice included heroin cocaine and alcohol a relapse could be even more lethal than a virus with a two to three percent kill rate these baseline stressors are compounded by the fact that she has just been laid off from not one but two jobs recently thanks to sobriety though matiya says she s not feeling too overwhelmed honestly it s ok matiya says the voice in my head is saying one day at a time and as slogan y as it sounds it s the way that i lived my life before quarantine and it s the way that i live it now i ve been living with a disease that s trying to kill me for a long time and i have a program aa that requires me to look at my daily life as unmanageable at least i have tools to deal with this unmanageability those tools include daily meditation prayer and checking in with other people in recovery while benefiting from the explosion of zoom meetings that have brought alcoholics anonymous aa and narcotics anonymous na out of the church basement and into the home in recent weeks but in a community founded on fellowship and in person meetings the ripple effects of quarantine are still being felt hard ryan aronson is an addiction counselor and founder of lighthouse counselling centre for addiction and mental health in montreal according to aronson an addict s tendency to ruminate and obsess especially when they are alone and under financial stress puts them at a significant risk of relapse the risk factors of mental obsession get exaggerated because there s nobody to use as a mirror or to break you out of the hamster wheel of negative self talk he says if you combine that with financial insecurity it s a recipe for disaster and while the general population can still resort to the essential services of state run liquor and cannabis stores to ease anxiety many people in recovery are forced to confront discomfort head on though this is something they hopefully have trained themselves to do sobriety conditions you to be comfortable with the uncomfortable and to delay gratification aronson says we ve learned how to be on our own and find ways to survive and live without self destructing or medicators or the need to constantly be eating shopping fucking or whatever it is the general attitude i m hearing from our community at this time is fuck man i ve been through way worse this is not my bottom this is life on life s terms this is a roadblock but i can handle this marshall was laid off from his restaurant job two weeks ago he s also just reached six months of sobriety and at the moment is grateful for being more fixated on his phone than his old drugs of choice i just got the gram of cocaine just kidding he laughs instagram i m just trying to figure out how to use instagram for the first time i haven t really had any issues in terms of cravings or urges so far thankfully bad social media puns aside marshall isn t taking anything lightly while he relied on in person aa meetings in the pre coronavirus era he says regular check ins with his sponsor and sober friends have alleviated the isolation he s felt since you might be physically alone but you re not alone in terms of emotional connection while marshall may be a relative newcomer any emotional discomfort he is feeling while in quarantine is far outweighed by the sense of gratitude he has for getting sober when he did if i wasn t sober i wouldn t be handling anything right now he said i m very grateful that i made the life changes when i did i have a bit of a financial cushion right because if i was still using i would still be completely dependent on my parents life would be very dark right now with a daily routine centered around his mental health marshall says obstacles like isolation and unemployment are a lot more manageable than when his entire life revolved around cocaine and alcohol i try to meditate first thing every morning and it helps tremendously to quiet the brain i m doing a lot of reading and staying occupied i m reading harry potter and walking for two hours every day just going for a walk is fucking great to normal people that doesn t sound like much but for me it s huge i ve learned to find positivity in times when there s a lot of negativity and uncertainty in the air and not fall into it susil is a musician and recovering alcoholic who was also laid off from his day job as a bartender quarantine has been stressful but accepting the harsh reality of a situation that is beyond his control wasn t exactly a stretch it wasn t too hard to surrender to this situation i ve already done that he says the first step in recovery is to surrender everyone is surrendering now but surrender is its own form of control like matiya and marshall susil s self care regimen has been completely disrupted by covid meetings sponsee work gym my actual day job and playing music with people those are my passions and routines and i can t do any of them right now but i ve been sober for four and a half years right now so i ve got savings so to speak emotionally and financially which i m grateful for because it s definitely not a good time to relapse right now in many ways recovery is a form of emotional prepping where instead of canned goods and toilet paper or drugs and alcohol introspection gratitude and a few handy aa slogans are stockpiled in anticipation of the inevitable chaos of life every person i spoke to for this article emphasized that the key to staying grounded in quarantine has been to reach out to others via one on one phone calls or zoom meetings reaching out not only to help themselves but to help others i m working with a newcomer now and she is so afraid to say that she s having cravings because she feels like she s failing at recovery ryan aronson says everybody is talking about how well they re doing in recovery and she feels inferior and uncomfortable saying i feel like using for someone in recovery being alone is nowhere near as dangerous as feeling alone and feeling alone is something that can only be alleviated by reaching out for help for matiya who s relapsed twice since being in recovery the thought of dealing with substance issues in isolation without the safety net of self care and community that she s woven in recovery is terrifying even though it s crazy out there all of us who are suffering or have suffered are still getting together and doing what we can to make sure that we re all ok matiya says still not everyone has access to zoom meetings or solid footing in a program that allows for phone calls and community when i think about someone going through this alone it s really scary because coronavirus likely won t kill you but relapsing will follow nick on twitter 2020 vice media llc
