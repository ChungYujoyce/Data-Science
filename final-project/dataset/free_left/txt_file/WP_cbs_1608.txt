watch cbsn live october 16 2019 6 19 am cbs news intelligence matters marc polymeropoulos correspondent michael morell producer olivia gazis jamie benson michael morell marc welcome to intelligence matters it is great to have you on the show marc polymeropoulos thank you very much it s good to be here michael morell people need to know that you and i are friends and our families are friends i think it s important for my listeners to know that what it probably means for you marc is that i probably need to be tougher on you than i am on most guests so be prepared pal marc polymeropoulos not a problem michael morell okay i actually want to start in a little bit different place than i had originally p lanned i know that you have spent some time in the middle east and i know that you have spent some time actually working with the kurds in iraq which are a little bit different than the kurds in syria but i really marc wanted to get your reaction from someone who s actually been on the ground have actually had to work with folks like the kurds to advance american interests i wanted to get your reaction to what s happened in the last couple days and to particularly what s happening today with the turks rolling into northern syria marc polymeropoulos sure you know i think when you know i saw the news over the last several days of what the administration had decided and then i think overnight the turkish incursion you know it s almost a punch to the gut at least for myself for two decades served really on the front lines helping train these indigenous forces it s on a personal level for me because this is not you know talking about kind of geopolitics this is face to face with allies whether they re in afghanistan iraq or syria who really put all their faith in the us government and even more particular in those of us who were on the ground training them or working with them and so you know i can see the faces of our kurdish partners our syrian partners even our afghan partners as they see what you know is nothing other than a total betrayal and i think this ll have a lot of ramifications into the future as well because there will be other conflicts where we re gonna need our local partners michael morell and they re now gonna wonder whether they can trust us for the long term marc polymeropoulos that s right undoubtedly and again you know i recall there was a great kurdish leader this is over 20 years ago we were living up in the mountains in kurdistan and i had given them our promises of future american support and i think you know the kurds are a special lot because they ve been betrayed over the years by you know everyone from the iranians to the israelis to saddam but after my promises of a future you know democratic iraq when we rid the country of saddam you know he took me aside and he said look you know we re gonna do this for ourselves we need your support but everything we do is not based on the american ideal it really is gonna be based on just your promise of support so i think you know even the kurds who understood realpolitik very well you know this is really a dark day not only for the united states but for a lot of intelligence and special operations warriors who spent time on the front lines with these forces michael morell and i imagine you know going forward whether you re in the intelligence community or whether you re in the military and you re having conversations with indigenous forces somewhere else that we might want to support that it s gonna be tough it s gonna be tough to make the case right that we re gonna be with you for the long term and you re gonna be able to count on the united states right it s gonna be tough to keep a straight face and say that marc polymeropoulos that s right and you know the middle east is a small area so everyone is gonna look back kind of on what s occurred over the last several hours and days and this is really gonna hurt us into the future again this is from the ground level to me it was a punch in the gut i think there s a lot of intelligence officers and special operations officers who are having some sleepless nights because they re looking at the faces of the individuals that we have betrayed michael morell marc this is the first interview that you ve done ever you retired from the agency earlier this summer you ve done some writing you ve shared your thoughts with the public on several different issues one of those is what we re gonna talk about at length which is you know how does politics affect cia and is cia political so i really wanna get into that discussion but this being your first interview and the fact that you ve written a handful of things why did you decide to share your views publicly after a life in the clandestine service michael morell sure well you know after 26 years really all spent you know in the shadows i think i wanted to come and give context to the american people about the organization that i really so deeply believe in that was not just my job but you know it was a calling it was my passion you know i think the cia has a soul you know it has a culture and there s so much good that we do so you know quite simply i just wanted to write and talk about it michael morell so marc before we get into the discussion of politics in cia let me ask you a few questions about your career you started at the agency in 1993 how did you end up there marc polymeropoulos sure well you know i grew up in new jersey just really a regular middle class kid you know listening to bon jovi and springsteen laugh and going to the jersey shore i think you d actually be surprised how many new jerseyites are at cia i think former director john brennan as well is one michael morell yes marc polymeropoulos but really two things led me to cia and you know this is just you know kind of on a personal level one was i read james michener s book caravans which was about a young foreign service officer in afghanistan and i was mesmerized by this you know lawrence of arabia type story and then the second one which was really memorable was a trip my father who was a college professor he was teaching in algeria so my father and his best friend and i when i was ten years old we drove 1 000 miles through the sahara desert in algeria in a volkswagen minibus and so i became completely hooked michael morell wow marc polymeropoulos on the middle east then and after und ergrad and grad school at cornell i was really hired into the only job i ve ever had michael morell you know this reminds me of a conversation i had with somebody who s undercover but somebody you know well somebody who was the head of the counterterrorism center when i was the deputy director and he told me that one weekend he had gone to graduation for a relative of his and how he went to this graduation and was talking with all the kids and how disappointed he was and i said what do you mean and he said well i asked them about their overseas experience and they told me about london and rome and paris and what i wanted to hear is somebody who had hiked their way across africa marc polymeropoulos that s right michael morell that s what i wanted to hear so sounds like you got that right so marc you started as an analyst right you did that for four years then you switched to operations what made you make that change marc polymeropoulos that s right well so as michael morell you started in my side of the agency marc polymeropoulos i did i did and it s a really interesting story because actually so many of my first experiences and the analytic side shaped the operational side of my career later on but you know i started in 1993 on the afghan desk and interestingly we had begun tracking a young supporter of the worldwide islamic terrorist movement a man called osama bin laden and i actually coauthored one of the first papers ever written on these afghan war veterans and then even in the third week of my analyst training the third week when i was on the job at cia that s when mir aimal kansi killed several of our colleagues outside the front gate michael morell january of 93 marc polymeropoulos january of 93 and so you know even as an analyst you know these were signs of what i would spend really the majority of my career on but as for my analytic career i think in 1995 after a tdy a temporary duty assignment on a trip to the middle east i decided i wanted to switch tracks and i came back and i talked to my group chief someone who i think you know very well he was john brennan and i went into his office and i said i d like to become a case officer and very quickly and in retrospect too quickly laugh he agreed it would be a great idea to switch tracks laughter looking back that was clear maybe i was not the crack analyst that i thought i was but off i went into the do and then much later on when john was the director and i was in a field management role in the middle east i reminded him of this story and we laughed and you know in truth he kept me in the agency so that was a good thing and michael morell you would ve made a great analyst laugh i m absolutely certain of that so marc what can you tell us in an unclassified setting here we gotta keep reminding people of that about the training program that operations officers go through marc polymeropoulos sure you know i think in a nutshell it s very close to the reality of work and life in the field it is that good it s a lot about time management it s about testing yourself and your ability to operate alone and it s not for everyone you know people do fail and that s okay you know there is a washout rate michael morell so it s not like five year old soccer where everybody gets a trophy at the end marc polymeropoulos no everyone does not get a trophy in the end and look laugh in the end you have to be able to master the core skills of a case officer which is how to you know detect surveillance how to handle agents with you know top notch tradecraft and then of course the core business of spotting assessing developing and recruiting i think i would often marvel even years later with real world operations and i look back and i would say that you know what i learned in my training was spot on michael morell so marc what is it like to recruit another human being to spy for the united states marc polymeropoulos michael that s a great question i love that question because it goes to the heart of why i really loved the job as a case officer because you know ultimately it s about i think the most basic of human personal relationships i mean i d call it a romance and then it s a marriage you know it s ultimately about getting close enough to another human being that you re able to assess their motivation to a point where you garner their agreement to betray their country and that s an incredibly intimate relationship and in the end you re looking at someone who says to you i m gonna put my life in your hands you know think about that as a responsibility of a young officer there s probably no other job like that you know in the usg or even anywhere michael morell so once they say yes you really have two jobs right one is to acquire the intelligence that they have access to and the other is to keep them safe marc polymeropoulos that s right michael morell and that s a huge responsibility that the agency takes extraordinary seriously marc polymeropoulos and you have that responsibility at a very young age michael morell and then the flipside is the importance of keeping our officers our operations officers our case officers who are interacting with these assets safe and you had an experience where somebody who worked for you was actually killed by someone that we thought was an asset can you talk about that a little bit marc polymeropoulos that s right i think you know this was what every day you hoped and prayed would ne ver happen you know i ll never forget standing in front of several hundred officers at a station and announcing the death of our colleague and you know to many he was a great friend you know this was a truly awful experience and i can still hear you know the howls of one officer when she heard the news it was absolutely gut wrenching i can t even recall frankly what i said that day i remember taking the initial phone call that our officer had been killed and immediately calling an all hands actually i saw my wife at the embassy as well and to this day she said she d never seen such a look on my face she knew something was wrong and you know i ll tell you even today i have intense feelings of guilt for what occurred because you know ultimately i was in charge and i ve about a billion times gone through my mind how you know i personally failed years later when i received my promotion to the senior intelligence service ranks my first thought was that i did not deserve that as that i had lost someone under my command now you know i obviously have intense feelings of what occurred so you try to take these feelings and kind of impart this on to the next generation of agency leaders because in our work this unfortunately does happen and you have to be prepared for it i ll finish this with you know one day i was having dinner with the deputy centcom commander and i told him of my struggles coming to terms with the death of one officer and he responded that you know he really dealt with this on an industrial scale michael morell sure sure marc polymeropoulos and so that was really sobering and you know it s a tough business michael morell marc let s switch and talk about politics in the cia but i think in order to set the predicate for that i need to ask you a couple things so as an operations officer you broadly did three things right you recruited spies you built and maintained liaison relationships with foreign intelligence services and you helped conduct covert action let s set the last one aside because we probably shouldn t talk about that laugh marc polymeropoulos right michael morell but talk for a minute about the importance of recruitment operations to national security marc polymeropoulos sure look there s no substitute in my mind for you know what is in essence a human s py so for a penetration of a terrorist group who could provide information on plots to attack americans to the penetration of a prime minister s office of a country who s negotiating a trade deal with us or penetration of a hostile nuclear program you know these are operations that could inform us of the most detailed plans of our adversaries it s obviously one element of the intelligence picture there s signals intelligence as well as we re listening on the communications of our allies but you know in my view and i kinda go back to the bottom line in dealing with a human spy these are someone who can provide us ground truth who can maybe provide us documents can answer our tasking it s an interactive relationship and that s really unmatched michael morell yeah it s that ability to go back and ask questions right follow up you know what did you mean by that what did you mean by this can you answer that question can you answer this question that really i think sets it apart from the other collection systems right those can t do that marc polymeropoulos right michael morell but a human source can when you were in the field running assets and then managing case officers who were running assets did you see the impact of your work marc polymeropoulos oh i mean i think we can have extraordinary impact so even in the later stages of my career when i had you know senior operational leadership positions in several of the mission centers i would go back and i would kind of tell the following to people that i would recall five or six times in my career where the front page stories in the washington post or new york times were the results of our operational work you know of course no mention of cia but you know that feeling that you were a part of history that you know perhaps you helped shape history and i m not exaggerating on that that s unmatched i can give a example of an impact that was you know not geopolitical in nature more personal that was in south asia where i was managing one of our bases we were tracking a terrorist target and this terrorist target had killed one of our officers several years prior and this target was still continuing to plan operations against americans so we recruited agents on the ground and over months worked against this target where we finally had him on the x and we michael morell you finally located him marc polymeropoulos we located him and we called in an airstrike and we killed the terrorist and on the impact of that you know i ll say that later that night this is from 10 000 miles away we called our officer s widow who was all the way back in the united states and she thanked us and you know that remains a really proud moment of my time in cia and to me it s certainly operational impact michael morell okay marc now talk about the importance to the united states of america right of cia s relationships with foreign intelligence services marc polymeropoulos sure and i think this is something that s not often really talked enough about in our line of business but really our foreign partnerships remain a cornerstone of our intelligence collection you know from our five eyes alliance that s with the uk canada new zealand and australia to you know our allies in the balkans or the middle east you know we ve really built a worldwide web of allies and we cooperate together against you know the hardest of targets michael morell so they give us intelligence marc polymeropoulos they do and friendly services have you know taken down terrorist plots against americans have interdicted nuclear material they ve helped us catch spies in our midst and provided us critical intelligence on our hard targets like russia iran north korea and china so they re indispensable and as operational managers in the field and at headquarters we spent a huge amount of time nurturing these relationships and again it goes back to what i talked about before in terms of recruitment operations this is different but there s an art to liaison operations as well because again it s all human contact and it s personal relations and it s just simply a critical part of the job michael morell okay so with that as background now we re gonna get to the political discussion and maybe the way to do this marc is for me to lay out some of the narratives that are in the public domain about cia cia in politics and the influence of politics on cia so i think the first narrative is that the agency has a political agenda that the agency plays in domestic politics here in the united states the it wants to influence politics here in the united states in fact tucker carlson a fox news commentator accused cia of wanting to remove president trump from office and that it was actually acting to do so the whistleblower was an example of that he said what i want to ask you marc is in your 26 years of service did you ever see any evidence of this narrative marc polymeropoulos no you know first of all the answer is a clear and unequivocal no and you know i see this in the press and you asked previously why i wanted to speak out and so you know this is one of the reasons to address questions like this because i think it s a utterly absurd accusation and it actually makes me sad because it goes against the fundamental principle or the fundamental premise of our role which was to protect the american people so to me that narrative is deeply insulting but i suppose it does need to be addressed michael morell yeah in fact somebody who i know somebody who i grew up with actually called me after the tucker carlson thing and said does the cia really do that marc polymeropoulos right michael morell so these narratives matter so it matters that people who have worked there and have worked there recently like you did can speak out and say it s not true marc polymeropoulos it s not true at all michael morell okay so there s another narrative out there right let me back up a minute so this doesn t mean that agency officers don t have their own personal political views marc polymeropoulos of course michael morell right of course they do do people talk about them in the workplace marc polymeropoulos so you know ordinarily no we re too busy i mean that s kind of you know what i tell people and you know when i laugh was at cia we don t even have access to twitter inside the building i mean perhaps the operations center does but we didn t follow the tweets we didn t follow what was happening we re too busy in the end but of course i have close friends in the agency you know a select few who i would socialize on the side and do i know their politics maybe a little bit but i can also tell you if we named 20 cia officers that i worked closely with other than maybe some of my close friends i have no idea who they even voted for i think what we did pay attention to and this is because it was part of our job so for example in a congressional election you know the oversight committee members may change well that s a big deal to us because we have a lot of dealings with oversight so that is of interest who is now gonna be on the hpsci or ssci but again at the end of the day talking politics in the workplace is not a prime job duty of an organization that is designed to protect america michael morell and to the extent that you might happen to know what somebody s personal political views are did you ever see those views affect what that person did in the workplace or decisions that that person made about their responsibilities marc polymeropoulos no again first of all the answer is no and it s again a question i find it s almost amazing that we have to address this i mean i look back personally did i agree with every foreign policy decision that was made of course not yet i deployed to multiple war zones you know i carried out the best of my abilities my operational duties you know i joke with people i have intelligence medals from operations in areas of the world in which i didn t personally view our policy was correct it didn t matter at all michael morell so marc one of the other narratives that is out there is that because of the president s decisions because of his behavior because of his critique of our allies because of his embracing some of our adversaries and i could go on and on here that he has personally made the job of agency officers harder did you see anything in either terms of recruitment operations or in terms of our relationships with foreign intelligence services which is why i wanted to talk about those earlier that would be evidence of that narrative marc polymeropoulos so look i think this is actually a really useful narrative to ponder and i ve thought a lot about this because it would be very easy for us to say you know yes because of the president s unorthodox style you know he s a disruptor for the international world order you know the tweets sometimes insulting foreign leaders et cetera but really upon close analysis to me that just does not fly and that s a really good thing so in terms of recruitments no i mean i don t think it has made our job of recruiting foreign assets more difficult because as i kind of considered what are the factors in which a foreign official would decide to spy for the united states you know these are all really personal motivations whether it s individual needs based on financial need for a sick relative or education for their children or maybe dissatisfaction in the workplace they re a religious minority in a country where there is a glass ceiling or maybe they ve been passed over for a promotion but none of these have to do with whether or not you know president trump has made a tweet or has you know insulted another foreign leader or disrupted the world order i think again recruiting assets is a very personal decision for the agent to say yes and so i don t think there has been an effect in terms of liaison you know this is where michael morell relationships with foreign intelligence services marc polymeropoulos i m sorry so yes so liaison is our you know well established relationship with foreign services over the entire globe and look liaison is very well attuned to american politics probably more so than we are they re very smart and so look in my assignments after the elections in 2016 i was obliged to spend really a significant amount of time with senior foreign intelligence service officials you know they were curiously assessing michael morell us laugh marc polymeropoulos us and the new president and his style and you know they were under some pressure from their masters as well and they d be asked at times you know maybe to brace us about something that the white house had put forward but look we ve dealt with this very professionally and i believe correctly by just we would note that we were all intelligence professionals that it was best to ignore the politics and then on our arena which is really building and even strengthening the bilateral ties between the respective services and you know i look back there is tremendous historic precedence for this so i think in one of cia s finest hours in the middle east was our link to the jordanian security services but this was years ago this was the jordanian then king hussein if you recall after saddam invaded kuwait the us and jordan essentially severed bilateral ties michael morell the king supported the iraqis marc polymeropoulos he did but cia maintained the ties to the jordanians and was kind of the sole entity that was able to kind of rebuild the entire bilateral relationship and look at today you know jordan is one of our indispensable allies so just to go back to the original question no i think our work with liaison under this white house has flourished you know i will note i think it s a question if one asked to senior fbi or department of state officials they may have a different answer those are organizations that i think have had a bit of a tougher time than we are michael morell so marc maybe one more thought just to u nderscore what you said about liaison relationships is in my experience they not only survive tough political times but they become the bedrock on which you rebuild a political relationship down the road which i think is exactly what happened with jordan marc polymeropoulos right michael morell so i think cia s relationships with other countries is gonna be really important here going forward marc polymeropoulos that s right i agree michael morell so one more narrative marc that s out there and that is that unlike the bush and obama administrations this one the trump administration particularly the president himself has little interest in intelligence is not paying attention has little interest in what the agency has to say is that narrative accurate marc polymeropoulos no i actually think it s not accurate at all and i think first of all you have to separate you know the administration from the president himself so you know in my time under this current white house and again i retired in june of this year there was a huge appetite for intelligence the national security council for example were voracious consumers the various national security advisors we ve gone through and i think you know a perfect example of this was the us government s response to the brazen russian attempts to kill sergei skripal in the uk in march of 2018 there was a well coordinated and really well executed usg response led by the cia working through the white house and it really was a textbook example of the administration turning to the cia to really kind of put the screws in the russians so this was a shining moment and that to me is not an example at all of an administration disinterested michael morell if i remember correctly the president didn t want to take action right and was ultimately talked into it by his senior advisors marc polymeropoulos you know look i cannot comment on president trump himself and i m not a member nor was a part of the briefing team that s a separate subject but look i ll note there is historic precedent for presidents to have a less than stellar desire for briefings you know there s a famous washington vignette if you recall many years ago during the clinton administration there was a small plane that crashed on the white house lawn and the joke at that time was that then dcia james woolsey was trying to get in to see president clinton who wasn t taking his pdb his presidential daily brief and woolsey would tell that joke himself so my point on that is let s not judge the administration their interest in intelligence you know just by what we hear about only the president michael morell so in your experience over the last few years secretary of state s interest in intelligence marc polymeropoulos that s correct michael morell high marc polymeropoulos you know i think that it probably was a bit different under secretary of state tillerson he had a unique management style michael morell but pompeo marc polymeropoulos pompeo for sure who you know got to know our building very well and you know was an avid consumer when he was our director michael morell secretary of defense chairman of the joint chiefs marc polymeropoulos absolutely our counterparts at dod were enormously interested you know primarily because of all the hotspots around the world michael morell marc with all of these narratives out there right cia officers can t help to read about this stuff in the paper right marc polymeropoulos sure michael morell how would you assess the morale at cia you know given all the fluidity of all the po litics and the way it s swirling around marc polymeropoulos sure look you know and as a senior leader when i left you know i was hyper attuned to this because this is kind of you know the health of our organization but my conclusion again and this is despite kind of the political storm in washington morale was very high there are young men and women who want to serve their country really in a unique line of work i think one of the key points that we stress and which is true is that the cia today has sufficient resources to do our job and enjoys significant support on the hill for our activities and that s not always the case so we have to really focus on that and i think our officers know that it s a place where you know diversity and inclusion is practiced and this is really important but you know back to the political side of the question you know cia officers are kind of always cranky so i think morale is high but we re always cranky michael morell particularly analysts if i remember correctly marc polymeropoulos and look you know laugh if you remember under president obama and you were of course there at the time look the national security council was a really bloated and at times stultifying entity and we complained all the time about a lack of timely decision making so i would say morale is high and cia officers remain you know appropriately cranky michael morell marc did you as a senior leader have to talk to your troops about all of this marc polymeropoulos so you know i think it would be negligent if we did not so the answer is yes and so you know in my last job i would meet and g reet every officer from every career track in our mission center whether it be a support officer operations officer targeting officer and analyst michael morell but you had all these people working for you in this new reorganization that john brennan put in place marc polymeropoulos that s right and in their orientations i would make sure and come and kind of address you know that giant elephant in the room and i would simply say to ignore the politics and just you know put your head down and get to work and i think that really did work because at the end of the day i go back to the morale people come to the agency really for the right reasons and they looked at the front page you know my last job was running operations in europe and russia if you can t get motivated every day to come to work after what the russians did to us in 2016 you know it s probably a wrong line of work for ya michael morell right so marc just a coupla more questions here what are the things that you re gonna miss about marc polymeropoulos oh sure michael morell goin to work every day at the agency marc polymeropoulos so you know i look back on kind of several moments that i think about all the time you know and both you know in the field and at headquarters but you know i recall walking from my apartment in a middle eastern capital it was a place we were under heavy scrutiny from a hostile intelligence service leading this small group of men and women at a station walking up to the embassy at night and you know you see the american flag under that spotlight and that to me was inspiring not only for officers at the embassy and the station but also many in the host country who believed in the american ideal i still get goosebumps about those days i talked about before my feelings of cia being a family when i was in afghanistan my mom died and i was serving on a frontline base along the pak afghan border and a return to the united states to new jersey was going to take multiple helicopter flights and fixed wing flights to make it home for the funeral our helicopter pilots who are military veterans from the special operations community and probably the most accomplished on the planet they flew me through terrible weather to get back home and i remember being on the headset in the helicopter telling them to turn around you know we were in a narrow mountain pass and the weather was terrible and i was worried about the safety of the air crew as well and when we finally got to the base and we landed you know they said look we did this for you we know what happened to your mom michael morell wow marc polymeropoulos and so to me how do you not have incredible loyalty to an organization that has men and women like that and cia to me is a family i think it has a soul you know it has a beating heart i never had a boring day in 26 years and so i was really lucky to be a part of that so i m sure i will certainly miss it michael morell marc thank you very much for joining us marc polymeropoulos thank you end of transcript first published on october 16 2019 6 19 am 2019 cbs interactive
