 they re always there they work through all of this and there is no one to replace them we should treat them like what they are a very important part of the country san diego joe del bosque never stops thinking about food he can t afford to stop thinking about it when you make your living from something and you support yourself and your family from it that commodity is always on your mind you worry about whether you ll be able to supply what is demanded and whether there will be demand for what you supply del bosque who grows asparagus almonds cherries cantaloupes and sweet corn on his farm in the central california town of firebaugh west of fresno also never stops thinking about a group of people to which i dare say most americans never give a thought in good times or in bad farm workers i ve done the same even though as a country mouse who grew up in the rich farmland of the san joaquin valley i know a fair share about farming and the hard working folks who toil in those fields to feed the nation i know that these folks are so good at what they do that under the harshest and most unforgiving of conditions they pick package and produce enough surplus food to export it around the world i know that california which has the fifth largest economy in the world and a gdp of 2 9 trillion would shrivel up like a raisin in the sun without agriculture and that agriculture here couldn t survive without illegal immigrant labor i know that these jobs are the epitome of what george w bush used to refer to as jobs that americans won t do and that this has less to do with how they pay than with how difficult and dirty they are despite that pay i know that particularly with regard to labor intensive crops that require a steady and dependable workforce the farm industry revolves around the father son and the holy ghost farmers labor contractors and farm workers i know that eastern media doesn t usually think about farm workers until they write or film stories about the most damned and that then they usually take the shortcut of relying on spin from the united farm workers union yet despite what i know i still don t think much about farm workers when i left home i went to live in a half dozen major cities my neighbors and i depend on local supermarkets for our weekly food supply during the covid 19 crisis that s a problem for the last few weeks i ve thought about food almost as much as del bosque does since we re responsible for feeding a family of five my wife and i spend our day planning meals debating whether to visit the grocery store ordering groceries to be delivered even if they won t arrive for a week and ordering takeout to fill the gaps with enough money to feed my family i don t have food insecurity but i am definitely suffering from an acute case of food anxiety so i was in a vulnerable spot when a friend and retired college professor said to me recently say has anyone ever done an audit to figure out if we even have enough food in the country to feed all the people who live here not likely according to the 71 year old del bosque the son of mexican immigrants tells me that americans have had it good for a long time all we have to do is go to the grocery store and there s all this fresh produce he said most people never think about where that food comes from it never occurs to them part of the answer is farm workers they work to survive because there is no safety net for those who don t work del bosque reminds me that according to some estimates as many as 70 to 80 percent of farm workers are undocumented that means those workers aren t eligible for welfare giveaways or unemployment benefits it also means many won t be getting 1 200 checks from the federal government as part of the 2 trillion stimulus package approved by the coronavirus aid relief and economic security or cares act it s asparagus season on del bosque s farm workers are out in the fields early in the morning harvesting the stalky vegetable they stand about 10 feet apart from one another he says but the health risk starts long before they ever get to the fields the main problem is the car ride to work where seven or eight men might squeeze into a van there is no social distancing there the workers will be out in the fields until mid may in late april another 100 or so workers will roll into another section of the farm to pick cherries in a small window about 10 days in early june it ll be time to harvest sweet corn all that is likely to happen under the specter of covid 19 some workers are already wearing bandanas to cover their mouths but maintaining a safe degree of social separation is a tall order the laborers listen to spanish language radio or watch spanish language television they know all about the pandemic they don t want to catch covid 19 but they can t afford not to be on the job there s no plan b they re working and they re happy del bosque says they re happy to have a job if they don t work they don t eat they re very brave about it we tell them to sneeze into their elbow to wash hands and to stay home if they re sick some experts are suggesting the virus could be largely under control by july that s good news for the farmer his biggest cash crop is cantaloupes and about 300 workers will descend onto the farm to pick those from the end of june to early october with a crew that large it ll be nearly impossible for everyone to keep their distance besides again the real danger is the car rides with more time alone to reflect people have started to speculate about what americans will take away from this catastrophe i asked del bosque what he hoped people would learn from all this about farm workers how essential they are he said when things get really bad like this they re there out in the fields they re always there they work through all of this and there is no one to replace them they re not appreciated we should treat them like what they are a very important part of the country listen to the man americans need to take better care of those who take good care of us the next time you sit down for a meal and give thanks for the food on the table remember to show a little gratitude for the heroes who put it there
