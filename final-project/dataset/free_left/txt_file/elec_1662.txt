advertisement supported by by alexander burns it was the messiest and most confrontational debate of the republican presidential primary repeatedly descending into free for alls of cross talk and name calling and for donald j trump s opponents it may have been the best debate of the race with the super tuesday primaries next week senators ted cruz of texas and marco rubio of florida finally laced into mr trump battering him for his business deals his thin knowledge of policy and what they characterized as his political opportunism the debate revealed the acute urgency each candidate now feels in making his case and captured how mr trump s opponents are approaching what may be their last really good chance to slow his political momentum even by the standards of 2016 this was a nasty debate mr trump has set the standard for personal vitriol in the campaign and he lived up to it in houston mocking mr rubio as a clumsy choke artist and once again calling mr cruz a liar to his face after mr cruz referred to someone as a crazy zealot mr trump leveled a literal schoolyard taunt and asked if mr cruz had been talking about himself but for once mr trump s opponents reciprocated especially mr rubio the florida senator caricatured mr trump as a dunce on policy who repeats five canned lines over and over and said that mr trump would have amounted to little without inheriting a fortune from his father should the race ever narrow to just mr trump and either mr rubio or mr cruz it could showcase a level of raw political violence unlike any recent presidential primary campaign mr trump has assumed an imposing front runner s position achieving the kind of political stature that might prompt another candidate to reach for the dignity and gravitas americans typically expect from a president not him his sales pitch has evolved little since the day he began his campaign and he made no effort thursday night to project the comportment or depth of knowledge that voters view as presidential challenged on health care mr trump reiterated a vague set of promises to replace the affordable care act by making many plans available to consumers when mr rubio suggested that mr trump lacked an understanding of peace negotiations in israel mr trump insisted a deal is a deal mr trump s supporters may be indifferent to his limitations as a candidate but his obvious discomfort handling policy questions and his apparent unwillingness or inability to elaborate on his ideas may further unsettle republicans already concerned about his capacity to compete in a general election mr trump s opponents have struggled to make a sustained case against him experimenting with a range of punchy attack lines that failed to stick a different dynamic governed thursday s debate as mr rubio and mr cruz assailed him they often used similar or even identical language and themes after mr rubio attacked mr trump for having paid a hefty fine for hiring illegal workers mr cruz took up the same set of facts as a cudgel both men raised the issue of trump university a defunct educational company over which mr trump is currently being sued their shared purpose was to question mr trump s credentials and alarm voters about his vulnerabilities in a general election they re going to pick apart his taxes mr cruz said of the democrats they re going to pick apart his business deals citing the trump university lawsuit mr cruz asked voters to imagine the republican nominee on the stand in court being cross examined about whether he committed fraud mr trump responded by talking over his rivals but he will certainly have to address the issues they raised either now or as the republican nominee mr rubio and mr cruz are both first term senators who were elected by running to the right in republican primaries both promise to be the first hispanic presidential nominee both have also improved as political athletes over the duration of this race but they have settled into sharply contrasting styles that were on vivid display in houston mr cruz is cool and clinical laying out his facts in a lawyerly manner and rarely flashing humor or emotion he knows exactly how he wants to sell himself to voters as a candidate of uncompromising ideological purity mr rubio is animated and aggressive speaking quickly and playing deliberately to the in house audience he projects an appealing personality without necessarily articulating an explicit case for his election as president for republicans not sold on mr trump these are the main alternatives available to them and tuesday s nominating contests may help resolve which man s approach will be the final point of contrast with mr trump gov john kasich of ohio has seemed to campaign almost in his own political dimension throughout the 2016 race he has deliberately wooed moderates and independent voters and has freely acknowledged that the next state he believes he has any chance of winning is michigan which does not vote until march 8 in the debate mr kasich held fast he did not attack other candidates and when asked directly whether his opponents understood how to reach hispanic voters mr kasich shot back i m not going to talk about that with some of the most conservative states voting on tuesday including alabama and oklahoma mr kasich continued to tailor his pitch to voters closer to the center breaking with conservative orthodoxy he said that businesses should not receive religious exemptions based on their proprietors views on gay marriage when he was asked about deporting undocumented immigrants en masse he cited a reagan era compromise as a model of immigration policy that law included an amnesty provision for people who entered the country illegally mr kasich believes he has a path forward through moderate and liberal states in the midwest and northeast and that his fortunes will improve later in the primary calendar even so he appears to have accepted that he will first have to withstand a wave of losses the new york times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign advertisement
