watch cbsn live february 4 2020 5 36 am ap washington the u s military has deployed an addition to its nuclear arsenal a long range missile armed with a nuclear warhead of reduced destructive power the so called low yield missile joins other more powerful weapons aboard stealthy submarines prowling the oceans the debut deployment aboard long range submarines known as boomers is a landmark in u s nuclear weapons policy it is the first major addition to the strategic nuclear arsenal in recent decades and is a departure from the obama administration s policy of lessening dependence on nuclear weapons in pursuit of a nuclear free world in confirming the missile deployment to the associated press the pentagon s top policy official asserted that the weapon makes americans safer by making nuclear war less likely critics including some democrats in congress call it a dangerous excess that increases the risk of war john rood the undersecretary of defense for policy said in an ap interview monday that adding the low yield warhead known as the w76 2 to submarines that tote trident ii ballistic missiles lowers the risk of nuclear war he said the united states will continue its stated policy of using nuclear weapons only in extraordinary circumstances he also said the warhead will help the united states dissuade russia from risking launching a limited nuclear conflict this supplemental capability strengthens deterrence and provides the united states a prompt more survivable low yield strategic weapon rood said adding that it supports the u s commitment to deter attacks against allies and demonstrates to potential adversaries that there is no advantage to limited nuclear employment because the united states can credibly and decisively respond to any threat scenario rood declined to provide details about the deployment including when or where the deployment began all details he said are classified secret the deployment was reported last week by the federation of american scientists citing anonymous sources and reporting that it was believed to have begun in the final weeks of 2019 with an atlantic deployment of the uss tennessee adding the w76 2 fits president trump s stated interest in beefing up the nuclear arsenal although he has not commented on this specific weapon his administration is committed to a broader costly modernization of the nuclear force the essence of critics argument against the low yield weapon is that it makes the world less safe because it offers decision makers another option for using a nuclear weapon in a conflict that could then escalate to a full blown nuclear war they also contend that lower yield air launched nuclear weapons already in the u s arsenal make the china admits shortcomings as virus infects more than 20 500 redundant rood however said the submarine launched low yield missile is important because it can more reliably penetrate air defenses than could an airplane armed with nuclear weapons the w76 2 is the trump administration s answer to what it calls a russian misconception of an exploitable gap in u s nuclear capabilities by deploying missiles at sea with a lower nuclear yield or destructive power the administration aims to dissuade moscow from thinking it could win a war in europe for example by firing its own low yield nuclear weapon first forcing washington and its nato allies to either commit to full scale nuclear war or capitulate the yield or destructive power of the w76 2 is classified experts say it may be about 5 kilotons or roughly one third the destructive power of the little boy nuclear bomb the united states dropped on hiroshima japan in the final days of world war ii killing tens of thousands of people by comparison the missile that has been deploying aboard strategic submarines for decades has carried the 90 kiloton w76 warhead and the 475 kiloton w88 warhead the newly deployed warhead was produced by modifying the w76 last february the administration said it expected to have the new version ready for use by late 2019 the w76 2 has been fitted atop an undisclosed number of trident ballistic missiles carried aboard the navy s ohio class submarines this submarine fleet split between bases at bangor washington and king s bay georgia represents one leg of the u s nuclear triad along with the air force s long range b 2 and b 52 bombers and land based minuteman 3 missiles the newest addition to the arsenal comes amid important shifts in the u s russia strategic relationship doubts are growing that the trump administration will accept moscow s offer to extend the new start arms control treaty before it expires next february it is the only remaining treaty limiting the number of u s and russian strategic nuclear weapons rood noted that deploying the new lower yield missiles has not increased the total number of american weapons under the new start limits because each of the warheads replaces one of the more powerful versions that had been exclusively deployed aboard the subs bruce blair a former air force nuclear weapons officer and co founder of global zero an international group that advocates the elimination of nuclear arms said he sees merit in reducing the destructive power of nuclear arsenals but we must not delude ourselves into thinking lower yield nukes are more usable in a conflict he said any use of this sea based weapon either first or second will risk stoking the flames of conflict and escalating to all out nuclear war a wiser response to an enemy s use of one or two low yield nukes would be to refrain from nuclear escalation while unleashing america s ferocious and decisive conventional juggernaut blair who testified to congress last year in opposition to the new weapon also argues that the rationale has been overtaken by events the russians in his view have shifted their focus to non nuclear means including with cyberweapons of striking primarily western civilian infrastructure
