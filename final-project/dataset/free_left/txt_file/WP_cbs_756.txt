europe in 2019 worldwide consumers spent an estimated 306 billion on personal luxury goods driven largely by growth in consumption across the asia pacific region according to management consulting firmbain chinese shoppers last year accounted for 35 or 107 billion of the total value of luxury goods sold worldwide they also made an estimated 70 of luxury purchases outside of china according to an analysis by coresight research spending by the chinese accounts for more than one third of the total global value of luxury goods so if you ve restricted travel and flights aren t allowed to go back and forth between the u s and china it will restrain spending at the luxury level sean maharaj managing director of aarete a global management consultancy told cbs moneywatch burberry ceo marco

insulated from the virus about half of japanese casual wear brand uniqlo s 750 china based stores which account for 20 of the company s sales are closed and vans timberland and north face parent company vf corporation has closed 60 of its china based stores retailers could benefit from a surge of demand assuming the coronavirus is eventually contained but it s too soon to tell how strong business might rebound we ve seen that happen with vehicles when pent up demand suddenly pops and we will probably see that on the luxury goods side tastes and preferences don t get dumbed down permanently and i think they will come back at some point maharaj said first published on february 13 2020 10 08 am 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know get the latest breaking
