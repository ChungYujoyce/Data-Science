the following is a transcript of an interview with former fda commissioner scott gottlieb by cbs news margaret brennan that aired sunday may 10 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we go now to westport connecticut and former fda commissioner dr scott gottlieb good to have you back with us dr scott gottlieb thank you margaret brennan we heard from the fda that they have given emergency use authorization for the first antigen test to discover covid 19 so that s any substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies against it how significant is this authorization how will this work dr gottlieb well i think this kind of technology is a real game changer and this test was authorized by the fda under the leadership of jeff shuren who runs that device center in 24 hours from receiving the application what it is it s a very rapid test that could be used in a doctor s office doctors now have about 40 000 of these sofia machines already installed in their offices and you do a simple nasal swab and the test itself scans for the antigens that the virus produces the test is about 85 percent sensitive so let s say a hundred people come into a doctor s office who have covid 19 85 of them are going to be able to be tested positive with this test very quickly it s a cheap test it ll probably be about five dollars a test and you can get a result within five minutes for the other 15 the doctors are going to have to have an index of suspicion that the patient may have covid 19 and send off one of the pcr based tests which take about 24 hours to get the result back but for those 85 patients that you could screen out right away you re getting a very fast result and you can start to take action immediately the company itself said that they re going to be able to produce about 200 000 of these tests starting right away but in several weeks they ll be able to produce up to 1 5 million a week so this dramatically expands our testing capacity as long as doctors are able to run these tests in their offices margaret brennan as long as they can run them how different is this kind of testing from what we ve heard so much about where states are struggling to get capacity and they re looking for you know reagents and cotton swabs does this solve those challenges dr gottlieb well it helps solve the challenges i mean every test paradigm is a little bit different has pros and cons the pcr based tests where the states have struggled to get the testing supplies those are more accurate but they also take more time and they cost more to perform the reimbursement is about a hundred dollars maybe if you do that at scale you can get the cost down to fifty dollars there is point of care based systems like the abbott machine that the white house is using or the genexpert which is very reliable those take a little longer to get a result their sensitivity isn t as good as the pcr based machines with the exception of the genexpert which is very accurate these antigen based tests aren t as reliable meaning they re not as sensitive so they re going to miss some patients who have covid but in the hands of a doctor who already has a high index of suspicion that the patient may have the disease and if they get a negative test and they still think the patient may be infected they ll send off a pcr based test they allow you to dramatically expand testing and they re very cheap they re very easy to perform and again most doctors have these machines already in their offices they re using them for strep throat and flu the challenge is going to be what the guidance is from the cdc and public health agencies about how doctors test in their offices if turning over a positive case in your medical office means that you have to do a deep cleaning and quarantine your nursing staff and close your office doctors aren t going to be testing and that would be unfortunate because there s a big installed base of these tests already in place so cdc has to come out with flexible guidelines on how doctors can protect their offices and protect their staff and also be testing in the community because if we can t do that then we re not going to have access to tests and the challenge won t be the platforms there ll be plenty of capacity to perform tests the challenge will become where can you go get the test margaret brennan you said this could be more accurate than the testing system the white house is currently using let me ask you about these aides who have been testing positive at the white house our top three medical officials in the u s government are now in self quarantine because of possible exposure they work in a white house that s a fortress but the virus has still made it inside i want to play for you what president trump said this week when he revealed one of vice president pence s aides tested positive clip begins president trump she tested positive out of the blue this is why the whole concept of tests aren t necessarily great the tests are perfect but something can happen between a test where it s good and then something happens and all of a sudden she was tested very recently and tested negative and then today i guess for some reason she tested positive clip ends margaret brennan the president seems to be doubting the value of testing in the workplace what s your view dr gottlieb well look i think testing has value in a workplace especially when you re dealing with places where there s people who are at higher risk of getting infected so you think about people who work on a shop floor or in a grocery store the machine the antigen based tests that we re talking about here that was just approved is actually less sensitive than a machine that the white house is using they re using an abbott platform but that flat platform also has false negatives meaning that sometimes patients people are going to have the virus but the test is going to say they don t there s machines that are more accurate than that abbott machine like the genexpert they take a little longer to perform the test the reason why the white house prefers the abbott machine is it gives a result in five to 15 minutes genexpert takes about 45 minutes and so i think that s why they prefer that platform but this is why we need to have testing out in the community this is why we need very accurate tests if we re going to be testing asymptomatic people in the setting of a doctor s office where someone is symptomatic using a test that doesn t have very high sensitivity might be ok because the doctor s going to run a confirmatory test anyway but in the setting of where you re testing people who are asymptomatic as the white house is doing and you re trying to catch that those people who don t have any symptoms you want a very sensitive test for that kind of a purpose and that s what we should be using out in the employment setting as well margaret brennan we ve talked a lot about remdesivir we interviewed the ceo of the company that makes that drug last week he told us at that time the government would be deciding who the drug gets to and where the rollout this week was pretty chaotic yesterday hhs revealed its new plan for distribution what does this indicate to you about how things will work in the future with other drugs or potentially a vaccine dr gottlieb well look i think we need to get a better system in place if the government s going to take control of the supply of these kinds of therapeutics and they don t necessarily have to do that they chose to do that they need to have a good system in place for allocation here in this case gilead gave a half a million doses to the federal government they distributed initially about 4 000 in new york city which is the city that i m familiar with i think they should ve been trying to push out as many doses as fast as possible because more supply is coming into the market there s no reason to hoard it or hold onto it and so hopefully when they start to contemplate the next therapeutic and there will be more therapeutics in the fall or a vaccine and how they allocate that they re going to have a better system in place based on clinical need margaret brennan all right thank you very much for your insight dr gottlieb watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream
