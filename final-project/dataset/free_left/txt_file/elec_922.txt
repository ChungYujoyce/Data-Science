departing president passes the baton to hillary clinton in emotional democratic convention speech that cast donald trump as a threat to american values dan roberts and sabrina siddiqui in philadelphia thu 28 jul 2016 07 05bst first published on thu 28 jul 2016 06 41bst barack obama led an emotional assault on donald trump s patriotism in his last big speech to adoring democrats on wednesday casting the republican as a threat not just to his legacy but to american democracy show the world we still believe in the promise of a great nation the president urged both delegates and a national audience which is in real danger of voting for someone he dubbed a home grown demagogue the departing president was joined on stage by hillary clinton making her first surprise appearance of the convention before an electrified crowd which seems more than ready to embrace her the biggest cheer of the week in philadelphia came as obama and clinton walked off arms wrapped around each other an evening which began with the raw emotion of people touched by gun violence from sandy hook to orlando became an overt mission by a succession of big democratic names to reach those independent voters outside of the room tempted by trump s appeal to struggling middle class families in an anti establishment mood earlier vice president joe biden stole the show with a blunt retort aimed at trump this guy doesn t have a clue about the middle class blasted a politician who revels in his blue collar roots not a clue chanted back the audience but it was a trickier balancing act for the cerebral president seeking simultaneously to take a victory lap and pass the baton safely to the right team america is already great insisted obama as he inverted trump s central theme to suggest it is his populism which threatens the country s values most the american dream is something no wall will ever contain america has changed obama said but its values have not adding we don t fear the future we shape it we embrace it as one people stronger together than we are on our own that s what hillary clinton understands this fighter this stateswoman this mother and grandmother this public servant this patriot that s the america she s fighting for on a day dominated by allegations of russian interference in the election and an apparent call by trump inciting russia to help reveal clinton s emails obama presented the republican nominee as fundamentally anti american we do not look to be ruled he said rejecting the strongman philosophy adding he is offering slogans and fear he is betting that if he scares enough people he might win just enough votes to win this election and that s another bet that donald trump will lose privately however clinton campaign chair john podesta has been warning against complacency telling staff that trump is not a serious man but a man to be taken seriously obama walked off stage to a triumphant stevie wonder hit signed sealed delivered i m yours which could be read as a love song to those in the room but may strike a more dissonant note among those that they still need to win over yes we have still got more work to do acknowledged obama conceding that change is never quick and that he had always insisted we wouldn t meet all of our challenges in one term or one presidency or even in one lifetime nevertheless a warm up video celebrated a host of achievements worshipped in the convention hall yet contentious outside obamacare gun control climate change and marriage equality i stand before you tonight after two terms as your president to tell you that i am more optimistic about the future of your country than ever before how could i not be asked the president obama began by recalling his introduction to national life at the democratic convention 12 years ago yet after two weeks of intrigue over who will be the next president he already felt like a historic figure half campaigning for his successor and half burnishing his legacy at times the great orator of the age felt oddly flat too upstaged by the energy of biden and above all by the uplifting address of michelle obama two nights earlier aides backstage revealed that the president had been through six drafts of the speech in the last week staying up until 3am to rewrite it after watching the first lady s there were sporadic isolated protests from the floor too something obama has had to deal with all his presidency but more manageable in a vast and overwhelmingly sympathetic hall the room came alive however when he turned to appraise the next president of the united states hillary clinton you may remember we were rivals she was tough she was doing everything i was doing but just like ginger rogers it was backwards and in heels no matter how much people try to knock her down she never ever quits he added to roars there has never been a man or woman not me not bill more qualified than hillary clinton then there s donald trump obama started before a predictable response to his first reference of the opponent don t boo vote he shot back recycling a quip likely to get good service over the next 100 days biden also rolled out lines that democrats are likely to rely on heavily in future weeks angrily reclaiming the flag from a republican party that claims increasing monopoly on patriotism it s never been a good bet to bet against america said the vice president to chants of usa usa we not only have the biggest economy in the world we have the strongest economy in the world we do not scare easily added a fired up biden we overcome and we always always move forward the 21st century is going to be the american century we own the finish line don t forget it hillary clinton s vice presidential pick tim kaine struck a more conciliatory tone making the first serious attempt of the week to reach out to the many republicans known to be contemptuous of trump if any of you republicans are looking for the party of lincoln we got a home for you here said kaine in a line that sums up why this virginia moderate was picked as clinton s running mate a series of republicans also appeared on video saying trump is a not fit to be commander in chief including the remarkable sight of the party s last nominee mitt romney being used to help boost a democratic convention retired rear admiral john hutson a former republican took to the stage this morning he invited russia to hack us he began to supportive boos from the crowd that s not law and order that s criminal intent more than 20 republican national security leaders recently warned that donald trump would make american less safe he even mocks john mccain he added before recalling a famous putdown of dan quayle donald you re not fit to polish john mccain s boots former new york mayor and businessman michael bloomberg also attempted to reach out to floating voters i have been a republican and a democrat and eventually an independent he said not many people in this room can say that but lots of people watching at home can and now they are weighing their choices i m a new yorker and i know a con when i see one he added in a strong attack on trump hillary clinton understands that this is not reality television this is reality former cia director and defense secretary leon panetta said meanwhile donald trump says he gets his foreign policy experience from watching tv and running the miss universe contest if only it was funny but it is deadly serious but even this moment of apparent unity was interrupted by more chanting no more war erupted a section of bernie sanders supporters sitting in the washington and oregon delegations it prompted arena authorities to shut down lights in their section the protesters to wave camera torches in the gloom kaine also ran into trouble on the left a small group of sanders protesters began to interrupt him but were quickly surrounded by clinton supporters who were encouraged to stand up in front of them by battle scarred floor whips others struck up a chant of feel the bern toward a moderate many progressives regard with distrust but kaine s modest self deprecating demeanor defused a return to the outright revolt of monday obama delivered praise to the sanders fan club if you agree that there is too much inequality and too much money in politics we all need to be as vocal and as persistent as bernie sanders he said that s right feel the bern but he also issued a direct challenge to the bernie or bust contingent you can t stay home just because she doesn t align with you on every issue obama himself remained popular among both camps prompting tears from many who sense the twilight of a groundbreaking administration jayne mazzotti a delegate from obama s home state of illinois said she had been in the room for all of his convention speeches from when he burst onto the national stage in boston in 2004 to when he became the first african american to accept the nomination of a major party in in denver in 2008 to fighting for his re election in charlotte in 2012 and now his final stand in philadelphia in 2016 he has evolved and grown with precious few missteps she said he s been a true favorite of mine as a president and i ve been through a few the difference between a barack obama and a donald trump should he for whatever reason win this election will just be a world apart there have been republicans that i ve been very proud of in a sense that they were a symbol of something they had an elegance they had poise i can t say that of donald trump i don t think even republicans can say that of donald trump she added randell tatum a delegate from massachusetts said it was a bittersweet moment to watch obama give arguably the last major set piece speech of his presidency the thing i ll miss the most about him is the spirit he gave all of us tatum said i think he restored this country brought us back from the darkest times and here we are watching obama over the last eight years has been especially poignant for tatum an african american who said his ancestry in the us dates back to the 1500s not only was he the first black president but he was a role model a man with integrity
