reviews for her campaign trail appearances supporting trump here in cleveland the republican national convention s rules committee convened early thursday and met late into the night to review the 42 rules governing the party structure and the selection of a presidential candidate the big undecided issue remains whether or not to continue binding convention delegates to the results of caucuses and primaries or to unbind delegates and allow them to vote however they want another subject of talks which eventually collapsed with no resolution centered on whether to return the party to closed contests meaning that only republicans could vote in presidential caucuses and primaries a group led by ken cuccinnelli the former virginia attorney general also wanted to make other changes to party operations republican national committee chairman reince priebus and several members of the party s leadership generally support the idea of reverting back to closed contests by awarding more convention delegates to states that hold closed contests cuccinnelli said he proposed giving 20 percent more delegates to states that opted to hold a closed contest priebus and his team considered the offer cut ultimately declined according to people familiar with the talks ed o keefe and dan balz contributed to this report ed o keefe and dan balz contributed to this report
