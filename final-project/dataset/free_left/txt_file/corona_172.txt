sat 16 may 2020 23 04bst barack obama has attacked the trump administration s response to the covid 19 pandemic during speeches to graduating students the comments on saturday were a rare rebuke of a sitting president from one of his predecessors and come in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 88 000 people in the united states a death toll far higher than any other country and had devastating and disproportionate effects on communities of color more than anything this pandemic has fully finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they re doing a lot of them aren t even pretending to be in charge obama said during an online commencement address to graduates of historically black colleges and universities hbcus on saturday doing what feels good what s convenient what s easy that s how little kids think he said in a second virtual speech on saturday evening for graduating us high school students unfortunately a lot of so called grown ups including some with fancy titles and important jobs still think that way which is why things are so screwed up i hope that instead you decide to ground yourself in values that last like honesty hard work responsibility fairness generosity respect for others in an interview with abc news peter navarro a top economic adviser to the president said he was glad mr obama has a new job as joe biden s press secretary biden obama s former vice president is running against trump for president the former president s comments came amid dual crises one a pandemic disproportionately sickening people of color in the us and another born by the economic impacts of attempts to contain the virus through lockdowns so far there have been 1 4 million confirmed cases of covid 19 in the us let s be honest a disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country said obama in the hbcu speech we see it in the disproportionate impact of covid 19 on our communities those crises as well as the high profile killings of black people by police loomed large in the virtual event itself necessitated by the shutdown of large gatherings to stem the spread of the disease these aren t normal times you re being asked to find your way in a world in the middle of a devastating pandemic and a terrible recession said obama he added that the injustices faced by african americans are not new and described the recent high profile killing of ahmaud arbery an unarmed black jogger who was shot and killed after being pursued in broad daylight by a white former police officer and his son through a neighborhood in georgia we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn t submit to their questioning said obama congrats to the high school class of 2020 as well as to the teachers coaches and most of all parents and family who ve guided you along the way thanks for letting me be part of your big day pic twitter com rjyvhs2bhc he went on to use the circumstances of the online graduation as a rallying cry for new graduates if the world s going to get better it s going to be up to you although obama has largely avoided criticizing trump s performance in office in a call leaked last week the former president described the us government s coronavirus response as an absolute chaotic disaster and questioned whether the justice department s decision to drop charges against former national security advisor michael flynn could endanger the rule of law in the united states the remarks prompted the us senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to tell the former president to keep his mouth shut the week also saw the emergence of obamagate a conspiracy theory pushed by the president that accuses obama of attempting to frame trump for colluding with russia to win the 2016 election one former cia

acknowledgements of america s history of racial segregation this speakers said made the universities essential while noting the perseverance required to spend a final semester largely online and the bittersweetness of the moment itself this is obviously not the way you wanted to graduate we get that said doc rivers coach of the nba s los angeles clippers but you know what else we know you re going to make us all proud graduates speakers said would be sent out into an uncertain world but one they had a chance to improve upon as graduates you now join the ranks of national and world leaders
