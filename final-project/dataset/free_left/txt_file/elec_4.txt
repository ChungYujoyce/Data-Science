 the politico caucus but republicans aren t ready to write off ted cruz s chances monday night by steven shepard 02 01 2016 05 07 am est politico illustration when the politico caucus debuted in mid february of last year a majority of iowans said wisconsin gov scott walker would win the caucuses if they were held then now nearly a year later roughly the same number 60 percent see donald trump as the winner when the votes are counted monday night few on either side doubted last february that hillary clinton would win iowa now democrats still expect her to win but republicans don t that s according to members of the politico caucus a panel of influential strategists operatives and activists in iowa and the three other states that will cast ballots later in february new hampshire south carolina and nevada advertisement the final survey before iowans cast the first ballots in the 2016 contest the new insiders poll represents the culmination of a nearly yearlong project over that period republican and democratic insiders have seen the race turned upside down and their expectations for candidates like walker and jeb bush dashed in recent weeks ted cruz was viewed as the favorite to win the caucuses only to be supplanted by trump in the last poll before iowa votes donald trump has broken every rule of the iowa caucus process said one south carolina republican who like all the respondents completed the survey anonymously yet it will continue to pay off the results just among iowa republicans were virtually identical to those in the other three early states a majority see trump as the most likely winner with a significant number still believing cruz will emerge in first a number of republicans said cruz s organization would catapult the texas senator over trump the cruz ground game will carry him across the finish line with trump in a close second said an iowa republican but even those republicans who picked cruz to finish on top concede he has slipped not just in recent weeks but in the past few days as well one iowa gop insider cited a poor debate performance last week and controversial cruz get out the vote mailers that resembled official documents accusing individuals of a voting violation for past non participation i think it is nearly too close to call with trump and cruz said one iowa republican who picked cruz i have a better handle on the cruz ground game not sure what trump has however while this is cruz s to lose he has damaged himself badly in iowa this week poor debate and the shame mailer are just two examples the 15 percent of gop insiders who didn t pick trump or cruz to win all selected florida sen marco rubio who is in third place in the polls outside iowa republican insiders in the other early states who largely oppose trump are watching intently some said cruz would win but conceded that might be wishful thinking by steven shepard he s close in the polling and has a better organization said a new hampshire republican who also conceded maybe i m just not believing that trump could actually win others appear resigned to a trump victory on monday night but are hoping to thwart him elsewhere if trump is going to be stopped it is going to have to be in new hampshire said a republican there democratic insiders believe overwhelmingly that clinton will win democratic insiders weren t nearly as divided as their gop counterparts they said by a wide margin that clinton will defeat bernie sanders on monday night crediting what they say is her vastly superior organization hands down clinton has the best operation one iowa democrat said it doesn t matter who i speak to whether it s in a big county or small on the western side of the state or eastern they all say the same thing they see no evidence of sanders organizing they have a lot of people but none of them are trained or prepared for what will happen on monday the lesson they took from obama s 2008 win was that big crowds equate to support in a caucus room they seem to forget that obama also had the best caucus campaign iowa had seen up to that point unfortunately for them clinton has a stronger operation than even obama did then and her supporters are more committed than theirs other democrats said caucus goers will go with their heads over their hearts and choose clinton much as they picked then sen john kerry in 2004 over former vermont gov howard dean and then sen john edwards undecided democrats will be pragmatic this year just like in 2004 when dean surged ahead of kerry said another iowa democrat clinton has run a good campaign in spite of not trying to bring new voters into the fold and sanders has not made a convincing argument that he is an electable general election candidate but while democrats overwhelmingly say clinton will win republicans disagreed a majority of gop insiders insist sanders energized supporters will carry him to victory one new hampshire republican cited the disclosure on friday that the state department won t release 22 email messages on clinton s home server in picking sanders as the likely winner big mo is going his way the republican said and hillary s email issues are now firmly bipartisan and even the minority who picked clinton as the likely winner claim the campaign has bruised the former secretary of state my friends on the democratic side tell me that hillary will win due to organization one iowa republican said but it will be close and damaging these are the members of the politico caucus not all of whom participated in this special pre iowa
