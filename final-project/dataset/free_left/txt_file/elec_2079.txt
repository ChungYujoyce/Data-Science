philip levine and jeff greene far outspent the tallahassee mayor campaigning in miami s little havana neighborhood on saturday mr gillum relished his underdog status my opponents have spent together over 90 million in this race we have spent four million he said money doesn t vote people do read more about mr gillum s victory here mr gillum edged out ms graham a former north florida congresswoman who finished second and mr levine the former miami beach mayor who finished third after dropping nearly 30 million of his personal fortune into the campaign ms graham a moderate had been considered the favorite in a midterm year in which many democratic women have fared well but her centrism and the implicit case for electability proved to be of little asset in a year when emotions have gripped both parties in the final weeks of the election mr gillum aired an ad trumpeting his support for universal health care legalizing marijuana and abolishing the immigration and customs enforcement agency he is also a vocal advocate of impeaching mr trump addressing supporters at her election night party at a bar in downtown orlando just before 10 p m ms graham called mr gillum a friend before during and after the campaign i said now andrew go out and win this damn thing she said because this is too important mr gillum s unexpected nomination represents a sharp break with recent florida midterm elections in which democratic voters nominated somewhat bland moderates to try to win in a purple state instead they lost over and over again democrats have not held the florida governor s mansion in two decades and they lost the past two governor s elections by a single percentage point mr gillum argued democrats needed to back a progressive who could expand the electorate by attracting more black latino and millennial voters who might otherwise sit out the midterm we re showing that we can bring together the bernie sanders wing of the party and the hillary clinton wing of the party he said in a recent interview democrats cannot win he added by trying to be republican lite florida democrats have long considered mr gillum a rising star in a state party with few of them he was elected to the city commission while still a student at florida a m university and he spoke at the 2016 democratic national convention in philadelphia but only in the last few weeks of the governor s race did mr gillum start looking like a serious contender early on he struggled to raise serious money as donors worried about an f b i investigation into city hall corruption an inquiry that mr desantis wasted no time in raising tuesday night he s embroiled in corruption scandals he said this guy can t even run the city of tallahassee the mayor who has said he is not the investigation s target consistently placed fourth out of five in public polls despite outperforming his opponents in debates with his charisma on stage and grass roots support in the audience his poor showing in surveys however kept his rivals from attacking him allowing mr gillum to move up unscathed by the pointed television attacks that engulfed ms graham mr levine and mr greene a billionaire palm beach real estate investor who spent nearly 40 million but finished fourth mr desantis s victory represented another emphatic demonstration of the president s iron grip on the republican party mr desantis steadily gained notoriety on the right and attention in the oval office last year by frequently appearing on fox news to defend mr trump transcript cheering i was able to talk to the president i want to thank him for his support i want to thank him for entrusting me with viewing me as somebody who could be a great leader for florida so thank you mr president cheering and let s look what s going on we have 4 1 percent g d p growth we got 20 year low in unemployment we have gorsuch on the u s supreme court and we re going to add brett kavanaugh next the iran deal is dead our embassy in israel is now in jerusalem where it belongs we have our hostages back from north korea our taxes have been cut and the red tape has been reduced i d say that s pretty good work for a year and a half the president took notice of mr desantis a navy veteran and praised his candidacy last december mr trump s near endorsement prompted a flurry of lobbying by republicans urging him to refrain from offering his formal blessing and among the party officials counseling restraint was vice president mike pence who served with mr putnam in the house but mr trump was grateful for mr desantis s televised advocacy believed the former jag officer looked the part of a governor and had little relationship with mr putnam in june mr trump offered as he put it on twitter his full endorsement recounting his intervention in the florida race last week at a rally last week in west virginia mr trump said of mr desantis he was at three and i gave him a nice shot and a nice little tweet bing bing and he went from three to like 20 something mr desantis was almost certainly winning more than 3 percent of the vote when mr trump weighed in but there is little doubt that the president s support dramatically reshaped the race mr desantis trumpeted the endorsement in his advertising and basked in the president s praise when they stood together on stage in tampa in late july mr putnam fought back emphasizing his deep knowledge of florida and chiding mr desantis for his television ubiquity the son of a citrus farming family who was elected to the state legislature when he was 22 he went on to serve in the house leadership in washington florida s not picking an apprentice we re picking a governor mr putnam said in the house donna shalala the secretary of health and

school board in arizona just three days after the death of senator john mccain republicans demonstrated how much the party had drifted from mr mccain s pragmatic style of politics to mr trump s hard line nationalism after asking the president to stay out of the race ms mcsally who would not say how she voted in 2016 sought mr trump s endorsement earlier this month ms mcsally one of the first women to fly in combat for the air force handily beat two far right conservatives who divided that part of the electorate the former maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio whom mr trump pardoned last year and kelli ward a former state senator who garnered nearly 40 percent in a 2016 primary against mr mccain and sought to capitalize on his death monday by saying political correctness is like a cancer ms mcsally will now take on the democratic primary victor representative kyrsten sinema in a contest that could help decide control of the senate speaking to supporters ms mcsally called for a moment of silence for mr mccain but then quickly targeted ms sinema it s a choice between a doer and a talker between a patriot and a protester ms mcsally said ms sinema also bowed to mr mccain and placed herself in his tradition of always putting country over party saying that arizonans need an independent voice in the senate in the governor s race there david garcia a liberal democrat defeated his centrist opponent steve farley to take on gov doug ducey a republican who may be vulnerable in november mr garcia a former executive at the state education department has sought to rally progressives
