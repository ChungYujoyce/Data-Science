pundits and politicians have been shocked by the trump phenomenon startled that so many americans could be so enthusiastic about his anti democratic style proposals but trump is not that original his actual proposals are in keeping with longstanding trends in u s history and society with the rejection and nativism that have erupted after each immigration wave his style is reminiscent of populist and fascist leaders who ve succeeded both in europe and latin america during periods of economic stress including such recent champions as hugo ch vez and silvio berlusconi authoritarians who elevated themselves and their supporters rather than building party structures or democratic institutions some observers believe or perhaps hope that trump s followers misunderstand or don t believe in what he represents they re wrong we will explain the trump movement cannot be dismissed as one of frustrated moderates some observers including president obama suggest that his voters are misguided here in the monkey cage doug ahleranddavid broockman argued that trump is a textbook example of an ideological moderate still others portray trump followers as working class outcasts of the changing economy that see his candidacy as a way to channel their frustrations and many u s pundits such as george packer in the new yorker explain all this by saying that voters on left and right are angry with washington and that both trump and sanders represent a new wave of populism but trump and sanders must not be conflated sanders wants to politicize inequality trump rather is advocating for anti politics by which we mean that trump s language and his followers celebration of his speeches primarily express a rejection of politics in a democratic key trump s stance represents the antithesis of sanders s call for political change trump s narrative insists that he is above the fray of politics this is of course an ideological and political claim returning america to national and international anti democratic traditions it is just a different kind of politics and trump s followers explicitly agree with what he says in december seven out of 10 republicans believed that trump tells it like it is as sarah palin suggested when she endorsed trump in iowa trump stands against politics as usual as represented by establishment candidates who are wearing political correctness like a suicide vest and enough is enough while the establishment hears random insults his followers hear a list of the enemies of a homogeneous america many studies have revealed the link between resentment toward blacks and immigrants on the one hand and support for trump on the other in other words his supporters like trump not despite his anti democratic qualities but precisely because of them his campaign rallies often include incidents of physical violence against perceived outsiders at a rally in las vegas according to nbc news one man shouted sieg heil trump is a post fascist populist we believe racism and charismatic leadership bring trump close to the fascist equation but he might be better described as post fascist which is to say populist from our research let s take a definition of populist post fascism this is a political style which has an extremely sacralizing understanding of politics the leader understands politics as a theology in which he or she is the only who knows what is best for the nation populists consider people as formed by those who follow a unique vertical leadership political antagonists are conceived as enemies who are potential or actual traitors to the nation populists want leaders to be charismatic embodiments of the voice and desires of the nation as a whole they argue for a strong executive and the discursive and often practical dismissal of the legislative and judicial branches of government toward that end they engage in radical nationalism and emphasize popular culture as opposed to other forms of culture that do not represent national thought finally populism is an authoritarian form of electoral democracy that nonetheless rejects dictatorial forms of government modern populism arose from the defeat of fascism as a novel post fascist attempt to bring back the fascist experience to the democratic path creating in turn an authoritarian form of democracy that would stress strong leaders and caudillos such as general juan per n in argentina and hugo chavez in venezuela in populism political democracy is strained but never eradicated as it had been with fascism modern post fascism pushes democracy to its limits but generally without breaking it trump s vision of america is the latest example of this attempt to redefine democratic theory and practice unlike hitler and mussolini trump does not have a real party he wants to be the republican candidate but party officials and ideologues reject him in contrast fascist leaders were often founding members of movements and then emerged as their leaders as we mentioned earlier trump s leadership is more akin to that of hugo ch vez and silvio berlusconi while ch vez who started his own government reality show invoked a vague ideological platform to gain power in practice he centralized decision making attacked freedom of speech and dismantled the division of powers always by invoking an external threat berlusconi denigrated institutions used his billionaire status to prove he was a political outsider and channeled the new european populism s anti migrant sentiment to hold power trump uses anti immigrant sentiment more often than berlusconi and other leaders like ch vez successor nicolas maduro bringing his rhetoric closer to that of other post fascist politicians like marine le pen in france the republican leadership rejects trump indeed many conservatives call him a fascist but trump embodies many of the party s views on immigration islam climate change women s roles minority voting and so on trump and his followers differ not in kind but in the clarity and radical way in with which they express some of the extreme consequences of the tea party agenda if we consider a longer historical process in which the republican party in particular has been traveling steadily farther toward populism trump and his followers might very well be showing us the future of u s right wing politics federico finchelsteinis professor of
