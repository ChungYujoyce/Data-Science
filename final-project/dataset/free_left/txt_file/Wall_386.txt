advertisement supported by investigators have uncovered a fraud ring that may have siphoned millions of dollars in unemployment payments with more than two thirds of states significantly relaxing restrictions an uptick in cases is predicted this briefing has ended follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic without the springtime rituals of traditional graduation ceremonies former president barack obama delivered two virtual commencement addresses on saturday urging millions of high school and college graduates to fearlessly carve a path and to seize the initiative at a time when he says the nation s leaders have fumbled the response to the coronavirus pandemic the speeches aired hours apart combined the inspirational advice given to graduates build community do what is right be a leader with pointed criticism of the handling of a public health crisis that has killed more than 87 000 americans and crippled much of the economy more than anything this pandemic has fully finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they re doing mr obama said in the afternoon address streamed online a lot of them aren t even pretending to be in charge mr obama returned to that theme in his address to high school seniors in the evening doing what feels good what s convenient what s easy that s how little kids think he said unfortunately a lot of so called grown ups including some with fancy titles and important jobs still think that way which is why things are so screwed up i hope that instead you decide to ground yourself in values that last like honesty hard work responsibility fairness generosity respect for others although mr obama did not mention president trump by name some saw his comments as criticism of his successor president trump s unprecedented coronavirus response has saved lives kayleigh mcenany the white house press secretary said in a statement that cited the administration s travel restrictions small business loan program and use of the private sector to fill the stockpile left depleted by his predecessor mr obama s comments were rare public addresses by him to a national audience during the outbreak and he said a leadership void had created a clear mandate for the graduates if the world s going to get better it s going to be up to you he said mr obama s remarks were billed as commencement speeches but they also appeared to be an effort to comfort and assure an american public divided by mr trump s handling of the crisis the former president also used the occasions to attempt to rally the nation in an election year around values historically championed by democrats like universal health care and environmental and economic justice a detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak with tables of the number of cases by county with states scrambling to pay out unemployment claims to tens of millions of americans a vast attack flooding unemployment agencies with fraudulent claims appears to have already siphoned millions of dollars in payments investigators from the secret service said they had information implicating a well organized nigerian fraud ring and that stolen information such as social security numbers had allowed the network to file claims on behalf of people who in many cases had not lost their jobs most of the fraudulent claims have so far been concentrated in washington state but evidence also pointed to similar attacks in florida massachusetts north carolina oklahoma rhode island and wyoming the challenge of pre empting fraudulent claims has increased as the pressure to get money into the hands of unemployed workers has grown unemployment offices accustomed to dealing with jobless claims in the thousands have been inundated with millions of claims during recent months the fraud attacks which the secret service warned could conceivably target every state could result in potential losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars according to a memo obtained by the new york times a new analysis of polling data suggests that the rapid rise in unemployment may be flattening though not for everyone the food and drug administration on saturday granted emergency clearance for a coronavirus testing kit that will enable individuals to take a nasal sample at home and send it to a laboratory for diagnostic testing the second such approval it has made the kit made by everlywell will contain a swab used to take a sample from the nostrils and a tube with a saline solution to put it in for sending to one of two private lab companies some public health researchers have warned that at home nasal swab tests can be less accurate than the specimen collection performed by health care providers which involves inserting a long swab through the nose into the back of the throat christina song an everlywell spokeswoman said consumers will first take an online survey to determine whether they meet federal guidelines for the test the survey will be reviewed quickly by health care providers affiliated with pwnhealth the company s telemedicine partner if a consumer qualifies for the test one will be shipped out immediately the entire process from survey to order to results is designed to be completed in three to five days ms song said the test kits will be available later this month according to ms song and will cost 135 the agency granted its first approval for an in home test in april and has authorized two other tests besides the everlywell kit to date one sold by labcorp also uses a nasal swab to collect a sample which is then sent to a lab the other developed by a rutgers university laboratory called rucdr infinite biologics in partnership with spectrum solutions and accurate diagnostic labs allows users to collect a saliva sample for analysis the agency expressed hope that another kit would increase access to testing as well as reduce the risks facing health care workers who administer tests in person a number of states lifted or relaxed restrictions on business and public life on friday joining others that have pushed for a speedy reopening in recent weeks and pushing the total to over two thirds of the country in maryland new regulations allow retail stores to open at 50 percent capacity churches and other houses of worship were pressed

and retail stores in most counties to reopen last month will allow businesses like theaters and amusement parks to reopen on may 22 with restrictions to limit contact between customers and employees the new guidelines do not apply to counties that are developing their own plans reopenings might ease the nation s intense economic pain more than 36 million people have filed unemployment claims in the past two months and the commerce department reported that retail sales fell a record 16 4 percent in april but in testimony before congress last week dr anthony s fauci the nation s top infectious disease expert said that relaxing restrictions too soon could prompt another uncontrollable outbreak the number of new coronavirus cases confirmed in the united states has steadily declined in recent days in new york the figure has dropped over the past month the numbers have also plunged in hard hit massachusetts and rhode island and some states including vermont hawaii and alaska are reporting few new cases but that progress is tenuous and uncertain only about 3 percent of the population has been tested more than 20 000 new cases are identified on most days and almost every day this past

social distancing measures despite the risk of a resurgence president trump s resort in palm beach fla the mar a lago club partially reopened this weekend though the scene was much changed a grassy croquet area where people often played on saturday mornings sat empty and the tennis courts remained off limits at the entrance of the beach club with access to the shoreline a sign asked guests to use a provided bottle of hand sanitizer when entering few if any of the club s members wore masks though all of the staff members did and some greeted members with elbow bumps toddlers ran under the blazing sun and adults ordered food at a poolside restaurant although they had to eat outside because its seating area remained closed palm beach shut down in mid march and is now under a curfew from

the gucci louis vuitton and chanel boutiques most shops were empty the louis vuitton and gucci stores required customers to wear masks people are coming for adjustment but nothing major yet said alan dacosta an optician who works on worth avenue it s still been quiet more states are lifting restrictions on public life and allowing businesses to reopen but some are keeping areas with the worst coronavirus outbreaks locked down churches in north carolina will be allowed to reopen their doors after a federal judge on saturday temporarily blocked a state order that was intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus by capping attendance at indoor religious services the order issued may 5 by gov roy cooper said gatherings of more than 10 people including those for religious worship shall take place outdoors unless impossible on saturday the judge james c dever iii of united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina temporarily blocked the order siding with several christian groups that had argued that the restriction violated their first amendment right to the free exercise of religion judge dever noted that the order allowed stores to open at 50 percent capacity and up to 50 people to gather for funerals the record at this admittedly early stage of the case reveals that the governor appears to trust citizens to perform non religious activities indoors such as shopping or working or selling merchandise but does not trust them to do the same when they worship indoors together the judge wrote the judge said his ruling temporarily blocking the restriction on indoor church services will remain in place for no longer than 14 days another hearing in the case is scheduled for later this month mr cooper a democrat said he disagreed with the decision but would not appeal it we don t want indoor meetings to become hot spots for the virus and our health experts continue to warn that large groups sitting together inside for long periods of time are much more likely to cause the spread of covid 19 mr cooper s spokesman ford porter said on saturday he urged houses of worship and their leaders to voluntarily follow public health guidance to keep their members safe recreational activities are in drips and drabs returning to new york state after two months of lockdown and as new cases continue to fall gov andrew m cuomo said on

in with her husband we sold out people were just so happy to be outside ms wilson had received only four day s notice that she would be allowed to open on friday on monday mr cuomo authorized the opening of drive ins and also cleared the way for other low risk activities like landscaping gardening and tennis but city dwellers hoping for a refreshing dip in the ocean at coney island will have to go without relief mayor bill de blasio said on friday that opening new york city s 14 miles of public beaches was not in the cards by memorial day weekend when they have traditionally opened for swimming and that they would stay closed until officials were confident they could be used without a serious risk of spreading the virus the announcement came the same day mr cuomo said that all state run beaches in new york would be open for swimming by the memorial day weekend with restrictions in place to ensure social distancing the governor made his decision in concert with his counterparts in new jersey connecticut and delaware who offered similar announcements estimating how many residents left new york city neighborhood by neighborhood even as new cases of the coronavirus appear to have ticked downward nationally in recent days the stress on food banks has persisted with daunting numbers of people who are thrust into food insecurity forced to use a system that many have not used before according to feeding america which represents 200 food banks and 60 000 food pantries across the country roughly two out of five people visiting food banks in the organization s network since the outbreak are seeking free food for the first time the sudden pressure has only aggravated challenges for food banks in regions already dealing with significant hunger according to the capital area food bank which serves a number of economically stressed areas of the washington metropolitan area one of 10 residents were already facing food insecurity before the pandemic since march 13 nearly 100 000 people in washington alone have filed for unemployment while some federal efforts to ease hunger have been stepped up during the coronavirus crisis the overall response has been inconsistent the trump administration has been criticized for continuing efforts to enact stricter requirements for claiming food stamps even as rates of childhood food insecurity have quadrupled according to some estimates only weeks ago president trump and his counterpart in china xi jinping spoke by telephone and proclaimed their unity in the face of the coronavirus mr trump declared his respect for mr xi and mr xi told him that countries had to respond in unison against a global health emergency their brittle unity collapsed as coronavirus deaths exploded in the united states the white house and the republican party tried to shift the focus of ire blaming china for reacting slowly and covering up crucial information and china has hit back the bitter recriminations have plunged relations between china and the united states to a nadir with warnings in both countries that the bad blood threatens to draw them into a new kind of cold war the city of atwater calif declared itself a sanctuary city for all businesses at a special meeting on friday openly defying the state s coronavirus orders after business owners showed up to voice their support for the measure it s not the government s job to protect my health it s their job to protect my rights and they re being taken away so thank you for giving them back to us ron danel who owns a company that makes gravestones said to the city council even before the general public was allowed to speak the pastor tasked by the city with giving a pre meeting prayer used his time at the lectern to assert as heads bowed that he had great support for the bill father god we know in your eyes there is no such thing as essential or nonessential said the pastor don borgwardt who is also president of the city s chamber of commerce all people are essential all businesses are essential all people s lives are essential with that about a dozen business owners in atwater a city of about 30 000 people two hours southeast of san francisco marched up to a lectern one by one and urged their mayor and council members to let them decide when to reopen and the council did unanimously pledging to not enforce the state s orders that many businesses remain shut and earning vigorous applause from the mostly maskless crowd mayor paul creighton a republican said the sanctuary order meant city police and code enforcement officers would not enforce any of the state s stay at home orders although he warned that businesses with state business licenses may want to be cautious we have to take bold measures and save ourselves mr creighton said he added that the crowd at the city council meeting was so large that the city set up two televisions outside of city hall to broadcast the meeting for those who could not get inside atwater s measure is the latest effort by a local california government to defy the directives from gov gavin newsom a democrat mr newsom has generally forbade restaurants and shops from letting customers shop or dine inside but he has allowed some counties to do so after submitting plans to the state merced county which includes atwater and has reported 200 cases of the virus is not among them with baseball and other major sports desperately seeking avenues for a return amid the pandemic some fans wonder if leagues are conflating their economic stakes with pleas full of emotion and nostalgia are big time sports actually the healing force so many public officials and sports leaders purport them to be and do their fleeting thrills provide necessary entertainment right now justifying the risks posed by large gatherings i don t think now is the time said pedro urbaez a devoted mets fan who has seen firsthand the peril caused by the pandemic while working at a new york food rescue nonprofit we need other things to be healed if you want to call it that before we get to baseball sports could serve as a cue of sorts in the same way that the n b a s decision in march to shut down which made it the first major american sports league to suspend operations helped awaken the public to the severity of the coronavirus the resumption of games could serve as a crucial sign of recovery but americans in general have expressed mixed feelings about the prospect of sports returning an espn survey of people who identified themselves as sports fans found that just over half missed watching live competition on tv and many said games should come back even if as generally proposed by leagues seeking to play again fans are forbidden to attend yet in a seton hall poll conducted last month 70 percent of respondents said that if social distancing continued in the fall the n f l should protect the health of its players by not starting the season edith duran quickly found herself in a difficult spot as the pandemic crippled the local businesses she counts as clients she could not draw her full salary in february and by march she was seeking relief on her mortgage she was allowed to pause her payments for three months starting in april but the company that handles her mortgage made a seemingly impossible request pay back the 4 450 in skipped payments on july 1 that is a lot of money to come up with all at once when we are struggling to get things aligned and get our lives back in order said ms duran who owes about 163 000 on her four bedroom ranch in deleon springs fla with unemployment soaring millions of borrowers have flooded mortgage firms with requests to hit the pause button federal officials have made it possible for borrowers with government backed mortgages to suspend their payments for up to a year without immediately paying it back but about 30 percent of homeowners with mortgages are like ms duran their loans are owned by banks or private investors and are not governed by the same rules and for them there has been little in the way of relief the world health organization along with the presidents of chile and costa rica announced plans on friday to pool data and intellectual property that could be used to develop drugs and other treatments to stop the coronavirus the pool which the w h o said is scheduled to debut on may 29 is intended to attract other governments and organizations as well and seemed designed to address the concerns that geopolitical rivalries and nationalism could affect which countries gain access to a vaccine or other promising drugs as they become available president trump insisted on friday that international cooperation was certain even if another country developed a vaccine before the united states whoever gets it we think it s great and we re going to work with them he said behind the scenes however efforts to understand the virus have been intensely competitive and secrets have been jealously guarded in march the trump administration sought to pressure a german firm into moving its vaccine research to u s shores and last week the f b i and the department of homeland security moved to accuse chinese hackers of attempting to steal u s data related to vaccine development on thursday president emmanuel macron of france also took to task the head of a french multinational pharmaceutical company after the c e o suggested the u s should have priority access to a vaccine because of its investment in the company s research and development health experts have advised that controlling the pandemic requires all countries having access to a vaccine warning that in past outbreaks like the h1n1 pandemic nationalistic export policies and intellectual property disputes resulted in wealthy nations gaining disproportionate access since early march nearly 500 people have died of the virus in new orleans roughly three quarters of those who died were black in april we did four times what we would normally do in one month said malcolm gibson the owner of professional funeral services in new orleans i probably had five husband and wife funerals i ve never had that the hardest part for mr gibson has been telling families that only 10 people were allowed at funeral services because of state social distancing restrictions that s my grandmother distraught family members would say to him she raised me you re telling me i can t be in the room many families are waiting to have funeral ceremonies for those they have lost some are going forward with burials this weekend as state restrictions are scheduled to loosen slightly but packed sanctuaries and crowded repasts are still a long way off normally a service would last for hours with large crowds of family and friends singing hymns and telling stories together we are beyond normal the rev juan crockett said he has lost four of his friends two others he said were recently told they had a short time left to live dr brian p monahan has been a calm and professional voice of reason during the pandemic according to interviews with more than two dozen lawmakers capitol officials and medical professionals who know him they say he has taken a personal interest in his influential clientele which also includes the nine supreme court justices even as he fields politically charged questions about reopening testing and precautionary measures he is both an executive with lots of health care responsibilities particularly now and also has the unique relationship with members that a small town doctor would have with the patients he knows and sees said senator roy blunt republican of missouri and chairman of the senate rules committee he s in a unique role at a unique time but as government doctors have emerged as trusted public voices and political figures in the face of a fearsome pandemic appearing in white house news conferences and as witnesses at marquee hearings dr monahan has maintained an uncommonly low profile his approach shows him working to stay out of the political fray and he is known in the halls of the capitol as much for his meticulous attention to medical detail as he is for his efforts to stay completely out of politics the complaint came in last month from a resident of kingston a city in the hudson valley a local barbershop was still performing haircuts in violation of new york s emergency shutdown orders two days later a buildings investigator went out to investigate la lima barbershop at 678 broadway was dark three more visits on april 13 17 and 19 turned up the same result the complaint was left unresolved until this week when the proprietor of the shop joseph lalima was hospitalized for the coronavirus he had never stopped cutting hair but he was doing it in the privacy of his home in the back of the shop he said do not open up your shops barbershops beauty parlors nail salons tattoo parlors mr lalima said on friday referring to the governor so i didn t when the house of representatives acted on friday to allow remote voting and virtual hearings the coronavirus pandemic succeeded in doing what philadelphia s yellow fever outbreak of 1793 the

party line vote 217 to 189 as long as the public health emergency persists lawmakers from alaska to florida need not leave the safety of their homes to question witnesses at a hearing sign subpoenas or vote on legislation democrats who control the chamber have stressed that they are simply trying to find a way for the house a coequal branch of government and they argue a crucial counterweight to president trump to perform its basic functions while congregating in washington is a dire health risk republicans almost reflexively are opposed to the changes and have denounced them as an unconstitutional power grab but beyond the partisan considerations a broad cross section of congressional scholars parliamentary experts and former officials warn that the decision could have unintended and long lasting consequences michael stern a former senior legal counsel to the house who writes about congressional legal issues said the institution was built on the understanding that its members would gather there is a pretty strong argument that if you cut that out you are losing something he added and you may not know how significant it is until it s gone dozens of babies born
