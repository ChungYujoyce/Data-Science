for the first time innearly a month donald trump looks mortal again four states held republican primaries or caucuses on saturday but the gop frontrunner came away with just two wins that were both quite narrow in louisiana and kentucky he lost the maine caucuses his first defeat in the northeast and got blown out in kansas and for the first time it appeared that most of the anti trump voters across the country broke toward the same candidate ted cruz the texas senator easily won kansas and maine and finished just a few points behind trump in both louisiana and kentucky cruz s victory in maine was particularly impressive until today the texas senator hadn t managed to top 12 percent in any of the three northeastern states that had voted so far new hampshire massachusetts and vermont this led many analysts to conclude that cruz s appeal was regionally limited that he couldn t win in the northeast but the maine outcome complicates this narrative perhaps the most heartening development for cruz though was in louisiana where results indicated that voters swung late toward him and away from trump and rubio the first votes to be counted were early votes which according to nate silver showed trump dominant with about 48 percent and cruz and rubio essentially tied with 23 percent and 20 percent respectively that looked like it would mirror what we saw in the rest of the deep south on super tuesday but as election day votes were gradually counted cruz s share of the vote suddenly surged while trump s declined and rubio s utterly collapsed the most recent vote total showed trump still in first with 42 percent but cruz not too far behind him at 38 percent while rubio was far back at a mere 11 percent and if future states results look more like those louisiana election day tallies things will get really interesting all this matters because trump has been winning plurality victories against a divided field so far he didn t have one clear nemesis in every state instead voters rallied behind cruz in some states rubio in others and even kasich in a couple super tuesday looked so excellent for trump because both it looked like the race might remain in that stasis for a while with trump in first but rubio and cruz relatively competitive with each other for second in a variety of states but tonight things suddenly looked quite different rubio utterly dropped off the map in louisiana and maine getting about 11 percent and 8 percent of the vote respectively he did a bit better in kansas and kentucky but could only get 17 percent in each meanwhile john kasich remained far back in every state though he did top rubio to get third place in maine instead it was cruz who rose to the occasion suggesting that we could be entering a new phase of the race trump versus cruz now trump will remain the frontrunner after tonight there weren t enough delegates at stake to put that at risk but as vox s delegate tracker shows he ll still have less than a third of the delegates he needs for a majority and cruz will be less than 100 delegates behind him if cruz keeps performing like he did on saturday beating trump badly in some states and coming very close to him in others he could well close that gap and depending on the results of the winner take all states that will start voting in mid march it s certainly possible that he could surpass trump that s not to say that he will do either of those things we don t know how a head to head matchup between trump and cruz would turn out but that late swing toward cruz in louisiana and his surprising strength in maine show that cruz shouldn t be counted out he may give donald trump a real run for his money just yet get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
