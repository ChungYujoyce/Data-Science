watch cbsn live updated on june 17 2019 5 08 am cbs ap hong kong demonstrators gathered here monday outside the office of the city s leader demanding that she resign due to the crisis over an unpopular extradition bill that has tested the durability of china s promises to respect the former british colony s quasi autonomy the mostly young protesters blocked a street near the city s waterfront as they stood outside the office of chief executive carrie lam chanting calls for her to give up the proposed legislation nearly 2 million hong kong residents young and old joined a march on sunday that lasted late into the night to express their frustrations with lam and the extradition bill backed by beijing many stayed on afterward protesters blocked some downtown roads well into monday morning but gradually yielded to police requests to reopen roads moving to areas near the city s government headquarters later on monday the protest revived after joshua wong a prominent activist leader rallied the crowd after his release from prison the activists have rejected apologies from lam for her handling of the legislation which would allow suspects to be sent to mainland china for trial she announced that work on the bill would be suspended after large protests last week but the legislation has touched a nerve not easily soothed in a city anxious over the increasingly authoritarian communist rule of chinese president xi jinping if carrie lam does not respond to the demands by the protesters people will come back and the struggle will continue lee cheuk yan an activist and former legislator said monday the uproar over the extradition bill highlights worries that the former british colony is losing the special autonomous status china promised it when it took control in 1997 on june 9 as many as 1 million people demonstrated to express their concern over hong kong s relations with mainland china the scenes are similar to those in 2014 when protesters camped for weeks in the streets to protest rules that prevented the direct election of the city s chief executive wong who was imprisoned for his role in the 2014 demonstrations and sit ins dubbed the umbrella movement was released from prison on monday after serving half of a two month sentence on a contempt charge he soon swapped his white shirt for one that was black the color of this year s protests and joined the fray after the end of the umbrella movement we claimed we would be back finally five years later we did it wong said it s lucky that beijing and carrie lam transformed a whole generation of youngsters from normal citizens to dissidents that s the price that beijing must pay wong said wong called in a tweet for lam to resign and for a halt to all political persecutions one concern over the extradition bill is that it might be used to send critics of communist party rule to the mainland to face vague political charges possible torture and unfair trials it s seen as one of many steps chipping away at hong kong s freedoms and legal autonomy lam insists the legislation is needed for hong kong to uphold justice meet its international obligations and not become a magnet for fugitives it would expand the scope of criminal suspect transfers to include taiwan macau and mainland china so far china has been excluded from hong kong s extradition agreements because of concerns over the judicial independence of its courts and its human rights record the vast majority of hong kong residents fled persecution political chaos or famine in the chinese mainland they value stability and but also cherish freedoms of dissent and legal protections not allowed chinese living across the border many hong kong residents also were angered over the police use of tear gas rubber bullets and other forceful measures as demonstrators broke through barricades outside the city government s headquarters during demonstrations on wednesday and over lam s decision to call the clashes a riot that worsens the potential legal consequences for those involved the protesters have mainly focused their ire toward lam who has little choice but to carry through dictates issued by beijing she has sidestepped questions over whether she should quit and also defended how the police dealt with last week s clashes many here believe hong kong s legal autonomy has been significantly diminished despite beijing s insistence that it is still honoring its promise dubbed one country two systems that the territory can retain its own social legal and political system for 50 years after the handover from britain in 1997 prosecutions of activists detentions without trial of five hong kong book publishers and the illegal seizure in hong kong by mainland agents of at least one mainland businessman are among moves in recent years that have unnerved many in the city of 7 million first published on june 17 2019 12 20 am 2019 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved this material may not
