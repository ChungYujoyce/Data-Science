important in this election mr biden said of ms abrams lauding her work on voting rights and calling her an incredibly capable person throughout the interview ms abrams praised mr biden repeatedly invoking his campaign trail language about restoring the soul of the nation and describing him as someone who spent 40 years lifting up the cause of justice a few hours earlier he appeared with ms

coronavirus he praised the officials on the front lines of the local response to the coronavirus and asked what they most needed from the federal government positioning himself as a leader who could offer them the sort of support the current administration has not in an hourlong event he peppered the governors with questions what were they worried about what did they need did they have enough personal protective equipment stockpiled to weather a resurgence of the virus in the fall if as many public health experts expect it does resurge if the conversation was granular at times it spoke to the image of sober steadiness mr biden has been trying to convey as he navigates the extraordinary challenge of simply staying visible much less demonstrating leadership during a pandemic that has shut down normal campaigning the governors are chief executives charged with managing a crisis and mr biden who wants to be a chief executive charged with managing a crisis but has had little opportunity to show voters how he would do it was aligning himself with them on thursday evening he and his wife jill biden also addressed a virtual gathering of his finance committee where he indicated that he believes a growing number of battleground states are in play and promised aggressive pushback to mr trump in what he expects to be an extraordinarily ugly election according to two participants a biden spokesman didn t respond to a request for comment mr biden is leading in the polls both nationally and in key swing states but the retail politicking mr biden excels at is no longer possible and unlike mr trump who is also missing his usual rallies he does not have access to the daily platform of televised coronavirus news briefings which mr trump has often turned into de facto campaign events advertisement
