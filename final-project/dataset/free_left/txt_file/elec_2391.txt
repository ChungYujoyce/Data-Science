 the politico caucus republican members of the politico caucus saw a different debate they viewed the vermont senator as the runaway winner by steven shepard 01 18 2016 06 30 am est updated 01 18 2016 12 32 pm est getty bernie sanders is riding a wave of momentum in iowa and new hampshire but his performance in sunday night s debate failed to dislodge hillary clinton from her perch as national front runner for the democratic nomination that s according to democratic members of the politico caucus a panel of leading strategists operatives and activists in iowa new hampshire and the two states that will follow with nominating contests next month nevada and south carolina where sunday s debate was held advertisement she wins anytime her opponents don t draw blood said a new hampshire democrat who like all the insiders completed the survey anonymously the debate which also included former maryland gov martin o malley was the final clash before democrats in iowa and new hampshire cast the first ballots this year and insiders split along partisan lines as to which candidate emerged stronger more than three quarters of democratic insiders surveyed immediately following the prime time forum said clinton won the debate compared with just over 20 percent who picked sanders as the winner but among republicans sanders was the runaway victor two thirds said sanders won to 20 percent for clinton most democratic insiders felt clinton effectively dinged sanders with her aggressive approach to sanders opposition to some stricter gun laws and his statements supporting a single payer health care system she gave as good as she got said an iowa democrat sanders at times seemed unable to control his emotions the conjuring up of bernie sanders voting record on several issues took a nick out of his vaunted saintly consistency added a nevada democrat republicans vigorously disagreed arguing that clinton did little to reverse sanders surge which has propelled him into an apparent tie in the iowa caucuses and a significant advantage in the first in the nation primary state of new hampshire clinton is still running substantially ahead nationally including a 25 point lead in an nbc news wall street journal poll released sunday morning hillary probably did well enough but she just can t shake bernie said an iowa republican his anger with wall street and campaign finance coupled with his unabashed support for a panacea of liberal ideas is just what the base wants to hear just as donald trump fills the vacuum for strident leadership republicans thirst for bernie appeals to those on the left that have a distinct version of the way things should be tonight bernie stuck to those ideals while repeatedly reminding democratic voters why hillary is a flawed candidate not all democrats credited clinton with the win some argued that sanders did well in a format where his opponent had thrived in three previous debates it was a draw said one new hampshire democrat and in that case bernie won because this is hillary s strength and tonight he went toe for toe with her all three were the best they ve been added another new hampshire democrat bernie owned it though to bring the debate dynamics into sharper relief insiders were asked about three specific exchanges between the two leading democratic candidates gun policy health care and clinton s ties to wall street vast majorities of insiders in both parties thought clinton drew blood against sanders on the vermont senator s past opposition to some stricter gun laws clinton cited sanders past opposition to the brady bill and measures that held gun makers liable for deaths using their product either bernie has a blind spot on this issue said one iowa democrat or he s keeping an eye on the rear view mirror for reelection back home even republicans who are typically critical in their assessments of clinton performances awarded this round to the former secretary of state when you re explaining you re losing said an iowa republican and bernie is still explaining on guns on health care democratic insiders felt clinton s attacks were effective while republicans were split with some arguing that sanders projected a more positive vision for health care policy by justly questioning sanders commitment to the affordable care act hillary implicitly questioned his loyalty to president obama a new hampshire democrat said on health care hillary is process and sanders is passion a south carolina republican countered perhaps the sharpest clash of the night was on wall street sanders implicitly criticized clinton for accepting campaign donations and speaking fees from financial services firms and insiders in both parties credited sanders with bruising clinton while also reinforcing his strongest issues a number of democrats who otherwise credited clinton with having a strong night pointed out that she did not respond to sanders implication that she received hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from goldman sachs bernie won by pummeling clinton on her coziness with wall street said a nevada democrat she didn t do herself any favors by failing to respond to the goldman speaking fee criticism clinton didn t even respond to the goldman speaking fee jabs that sanders threw at her said another nevada democrat seems like he might ve caught her off guard and she stumbled some democrats felt sanders botched the attack however bernie quickly ramped up into a frenzy an iowa democrat said he stepped over the line from passionately debating to ranting republicans overwhelmingly thought sanders got the better of this exchange sanders is going to win this one every time said a new hampshire republican clinton and o malley need to understand they are playing on foreign turf and work to shorten these exchanges and move on to the next question broadly speaking some democrats thought the debate s focus on sanders he spoke for longer than clinton according to politico s calculations may have backfired this turned out to be a referendum on his candidacy and not in a good way said a new hampshire democrat he spent most of the night on defense which in turn made him look nervous finally south carolina is not new hampshire a number of times the applause lines he looked like he was expecting mid speech simply never came these are the
