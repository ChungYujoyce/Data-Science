the economist a fine british newsmagazine is rarely wrong but it was recently in strongly suggesting that the casual disregard for truth that is the very soul of donald trump s campaign is something new under the sun the technology tweets and such certainly is but his cascade of immense lies certainly is not i d like to familiarize the economist with adolf hitler i realize that the name hitler has the distractive quality of pornography and so i cite it only with reluctance hitler however was not a fictional creation but a real man who was legally chosen to be germany s chancellor and while trump is neither an anti semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries he is hitlerian in his thinking he thinks the truth is what he says it is soon after becoming chancellor hitler announced that the jews had declared war on germany it was a preposterous statement because jews were less than 1 percent of germany s population and had neither the numbers nor the power to make war on anything in fact in sheer preposterousness it compares to trump s insistence that barack obama was not born in the united states a position he tenaciously held even after obama released his hawaiian birth certificate at the time people tried to make sense of hitler s statements by saying he was seeking a scapegoat and had settled on the jews not so from my readings i know of no instance in which hitler confided to an intimate that of course his statements about jews were as we might now say over the top in fact he remained consistently deranged on the topic he was not lying for him it was the truth trump s fixation on obama s birthplace is similar it was not as far as he s concerned a lie it was a strongly felt truth that he abandoned only last week and then only under intense pressure not out of conviction to trump the lie was not what he had been saying about obama s birthplace it was the one he had told when he finally was compelled to say that obama was born in the u s a the reason he did not apologize for having so long insisted otherwise is that an apology would have crossed his personal red line like a child he had his fingers crossed just as hitler s remarks about jews were deeply rooted in german anti semitism so was trump s birtherism rooted in american racism with some anti muslim sentiment thrown in trump s adamant insistence on it raised issues not as some have so delicately put it about his demeanor but instead about his rationality it made a joke out of the entire furor over revealing his medical records i m sure that trump is fine physically mentally it s a different story in a purloined email colin powell called trump s birther fixation racist but the former secretary of state has never done so publicly and his hesitation about hillary clinton for good reason she comes across as sleazy is no excuse for being awol in this fight like henry kissinger george p shultz and some other gop grandees he has retreated to a neutral corner as if the fight is not his too they all have their qualms with clinton but not a single one of them can possibly believe that the united states and its values will not survive her presidency a trump presidency is a different matter it s a mistake to make the unreasonable compatible with the reasonable to think say that trump cannot be serious about this birther stuff or building a wall or likening the difficulties of becoming a billionaire to the loss of a son in iraq that was the authentic trump a man totally unburdened by concern for anyone else there is no lie that cannot be believed even after germany had murdered most of europe s jews allied investigators at the end of world war ii found that many germans believed as historian nicholas stargardt put it that their country s defeat only confirmed the power of world jewry germany was not some weird place at the advent of the hitler era it was a democracy an advanced nation culturally rich and scientifically advanced it had a unique history its defeat in world war i the hyperinflation of the 1920s so it cannot easily be likened to the contemporary united states but it was not all that different either in 1933 it chose a sociopathic liar as its leader if the polls are to be believed we may do the same read more from richard cohen s archive read more on this topic the post s view donald trump is a unique threat to american democracy robert kagan this is how fascism comes to america peter ross range the theory of political leadership that donald trump shares with adolf hitler shalom auslander don t compare donald trump to adolf hitler it belittles hitler mike godwin sure call trump a nazi just make sure you know what you re talking about we are a participant in the amazon services llc associates program an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon com and affiliated sites
