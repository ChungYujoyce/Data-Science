i m not sure when it started but at some point the republican party ceded the business of governance to the democrats maybe it began with the tea party movement or fox news or the larger conservative media industrial complex i honestly don t know but it s clear now that the gop is no longer a legitimate governing party a party that allows rank neophytes like herman cain and donald trump and ben carson and carly fiorina to run for the highest office in the country has lost its way if you look at how the republican party operates today it s hard to avoid the conclusion that governing just isn t a priority or internal pressures within the party make it impossible instead the gop has become what i previously called a self perpetuating hype machine for conservative political entrepreneurs particularly at the national level republican candidates and legislators many of them at least show no interest in compromise or serious policymaking which is what you d expect from a party of and for purists while the new gop has been bad for the country it s been great for political celebrities people looking to promote their personal brands ted cruz is the most recent and obvious example of this approach to politics cruz has been a remarkably ineffective senator he has done nothing but bloviate and showboat on the senate floor he s accomplished zero legislatively his only practical contribution has been to obstruct and draw attention to his martyrdom read presidential campaign ted cruz will never be elected president if he manages to win the republican nomination he ll lose in a landslide to a democrat whoever that happens to be and because he s so eagerly made a spectacle of himself in the senate he s alienated all but the tiniest segment of his own party which means he has no political capital in congress hardly a concern for someone uninterested in legislating however cruz s latest squabble with rand paul helps to illustrate cruz s intentions in an interview with fox news brian kilmeade paul basically wrote cruz s political obituary ted has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership and call them names which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the senate and as a consequence he can t get anything done legislatively he is pretty much done for and stifled and it s really because of personal relationships or lack of personal relationships and it is a problem i approach things a little different i am still just as hardcore in saying what we are doing i just chose not to call people liars on the senate floor and it s just a matter of different perspectives on how best to get to the end result paul is right of course but he omits an essential point cruz has been ineffective by design managing relationships and respecting decorum only matter to people trying to accomplish things in the senate that s not what cruz is up to like the fanatical tea party wing of the house cruz is there to obstruct and self promote in all likelihood cruz will retire after a single term in the senate now that he s boosted his national profile and endeared himself to the insurgent elements of the base he can pivot to the private sector and make more money as a professional conservative activist as for example jim demint did in 2012 cruz ought to be seen as the grifter that he is it was never about policy for him when he leaves the senate he ll be a hero to the fringe right he ll make a fortune on the conservative lecture circuit telling rapturous audiences about his willingness to challenge the washington cartel it won t matter that he accomplished nothing changed nothing it ll be enough that he pretended to while he was there the same is true of carson and trump and fiorina and even politicians like huckabee and jindal none of them will be president but their over the top activism will ensure them a profitable career after politics and that i assume is the whole point the democrats have their share of bad politicians but you don t see this kind of faux activism and exploitation in their party this is a uniquely republican problem sean illing is a usaf veteran who previously taught philosophy and politics at loyola and lsu he is currently salon s politics writer follow him on facebook and twitter read his blog here email at silling salon com copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
