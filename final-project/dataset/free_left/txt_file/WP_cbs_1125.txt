our studio on the roof of the jones day law firm here on capitol hill where we ll be broadcasting for the next few weeks while our washington studio gets some adjustments we begin this morning with the chairman of the house intelligence committee california s adam schiff good morning good to have you here chairman representative adam schiff d california repadamschiff intelligence committee chairman good morning margaret brennan we saw this attack that secretary of state pompeo says was a terror attack carried out by iran in saudi arabia what does u s intelligence show representative adam schiff well i have not had the briefing yet on whether this is directly attributable to iran but i think it s safe to say that the houthis don t have the capability to do a strike like this without iranian assistance so iranian know how running technology i think was certainly involved whether the iranians directly engaged in this or through the houthi proxies has yet to be seen but i think it underscores just what we really frankly came to expect from this unending war in yemen that it would escalate tensions in the region but also our withdrawal from the jcpoa has led iran to engage margaret brennan the nuclear deal with iran representative adam schiff exactly has let iran to engage in these escalatory tactics to drive us apart from our allies but also to increase iranian leverage to try to bring about an end to sanctions margaret brennan do you think the president should withdraw his offer to sit down and begin talks with iran representative adam schiff i think the president should engage in diplomacy with iran i think it s the only way out of this situation i don t think frankly the president should have withdrawn from a nuclear deal that iran was complying with but we need to work with our allies to secure the strait of hormuz to secure critical infrastructure in the region but we do need to get back to diplomacy and there are openings to do so there are voices within iran unusual voices including some arch conservatives suggesting it s time to start talking with the united states again the administration should seize that opportunity margaret brennan we also heard from the white house yes yesterday that they confirmed hamza bin laden the son of osama bin laden was killed in afghanistan pakistan area this was originally reported back in july you ve been briefed what can you tell us representative adam schiff well he he has been killed good riddance i think this is someone of great symbolic value to al qaeda someone margaret brennan how was he killed representative adam schiff i can t go into the specifics more than what the white house has disclosed but it shows they have acknowledged that this was in the af pak region it shows the continuing importance of that region to al qaeda it it also shows the importance of the region to us in terms of our security that we need to maintain some footprint or some guarantee that al qaeda won t resurge in the area but he was not i think a leader a current leader of al qaeda in an operational sense margaret brennan mm hm representative adam schiff so i think if his name wasn t bin laden it wouldn t have had the same impact but nonetheless an important step in terms of taking more of the leadership of al qaeda off the battlefield margaret brennan should the president continue negotiating with the taliban representative adam schiff the president should i don t think the negotiations should have been called off because of a ill planned ill prepared summit and it falling apart at the end of the day there s only going to be one way to resolve the conflict in afghanistan that s through the negotiation but we should secure more than taliban promises in that negotiation in exchange for a drawdown of american troops we have to insist on at least the partial cease fire so that we can see that the taliban are both willing but also able to control their own elements margaret brennan i want to ask you about some work you re doing here at home which was you issued a subpoena on friday for the acting director of intelligence alleging he is withholding a whistleblower disclosure possibly to protect president trump that s a pretty significant allegation here we re putting up a quote on the screen from you have you gotten a response to this letter representative adam schiff we ve gotten a response and the director has said essentially that he is answering to a higher authority and refusing to turn over the whistleblower complaint this is deeply troubling no director margaret brennan just ignoring the subpoena representative adam schiff well at this point yes ignoring the subpoena ignoring our request no dni no director of national intelligence has ever refused to turn over a whistleblower complaint and here margaret the significance is the inspector general found this complaint to be urgent found it to be credible that is they did some preliminary investigation found the whistleblower to be credible that suggests corroboration and that it involved serious or flagrant wrongdoing and according to the director of national intelligence the reason he is not acting to provide it even though the statute mandates that he do so is because he is being instructed not to that this involved a higher authority someone above the dni well there are only a few people margaret brennan yeah representative adam schiff above the dni so we are concerned this area this involves wrongdoing that s under investigation by our committee and we are going to do everything necessary to make sure that whistleblowers not allowed to provide the complaint to us but can come directly to congress which the director is also prohibiting at this point margaret brennan so you don t know but you suspect the president has some role or the executive branch here can you can you tell us what the subject was of the whistleblower complaint representative adam schiff i can t go into the contents but i can tell you that at least according to the director of national intelligence this involves an issue of privileged communications now that means it s a pretty narrow group of people that it could apply to that are both above the dni in authority and also involve privileged communications so i think it s fair to assume this involves either the president or people around him or both but at the end of the day if the margaret brennan mm hm representative adam schiff director of national intelligence is going to undermine the whistleblower protections it means that people are going to end up taking the law into their own hands and going directly to the press instead of the mechanism that congress set to protect classified information margaret brennan mm hm representative adam schiff and that gravely threatens both our national security as well as a system that encourages people to expose wrongdoing margaret brennan you re in leadership there seems to be confusion within the democratic party about whether or not there is actually an impeachment inquiry underway can you clarify representative adam schiff yes we re doing an investigation that will ultimately determine whether the president should be impeached now there are people margaret brennan so there is an inquiry underway representative adam schiff there s certainly an investigation under underway now the this is about more than just message there are some of our members who are ready to vote to impeach and remove the president tomorrow and there are some who believe that we should not impeach him because it will be a failed exercise in the senate but the vast majority of our caucus including our leadership is of the view that we should do the investigation before we determine whether the president should be impeached that s the category that i fit in and that s the work that we re doing margaret brennan mm hm representative adam schiff and that s all that s required in court to get access to the grand jury mat material we need to do our jobs margaret brennan we have to leave it there congressman thank you very much representative adam schiff thank you margaret brennan well one democrat who has called for the president to be impeached and did so early on was minnesota democratic congresswoman ilhan omar she came to the united states as a refugee and she is the first somali american to be elected to congress as part of the so called squad she has drawn a considerable amount of attention for her progressive and sometimes controversial views and we welcome her here to the broadcast congresswoman it s good to have you here representative ilhan omar d minnesota ilhan thank you so much for having me margaret margaret brennan you heard what chairman schiff said we know more than half of the democratic caucus supports impeachment now you re among them do you think speaker pelosi is being too hesitant representative ilhan omar well what i ve always said was that it wasn t if we were going to impeach it s when we were going to impeach and i think it is okay for some people to have hesitations for other people to catch up to where some of us have been for a really long time and i think with chairman nadler he understands that you know we have a constitutional duty and we must exercise that constitutional duty margaret brennan do you think though because of the sheer numbers now i think we are one hundred and thirty six democrats who support an impeachment inquiry at least are we at a tipping point where those decisions need to be made representative ilhan omar yes and the decisions are being made this is why they took the vote to begin the investigation margaret brennan mm hm representative ilhan omar and i really feel confident that they are in the process of getting everybody else who is still lagging to come along margaret brennan now we said in the introduction you re controversial the republican national committee has released a video of you and it i want to read you just some of it you re comparing migrant shelters to dungeons used about four hundred years ago in ghana that you recently visited and you toured those caves in ghana recently it s getting a lot of attention did you mean when you were talking there to compare u s border agents to slave traders representative ilhan omar so i m only controversial because people seem to want to controversy what i talked about at our panel that was the plight of black immigrants was about the experience i was having as i went through the dungeons there were stories that were being told and i talked about how at that moment i had an image of what s happening in libya margaret brennan mm hm representative ilhan omar as as people as are being sold we ve we ve all seen that video that auction of somebody being sold for four hundred dollars and then i talked about the separation stories that he told about how families were being torn apart how children were being separated from their parents how husband and wife would be forcefully separated and i said that kind of reminded me of what was happening at our border here margaret brennan but you didn t mean it as an attack on u s border agents representative ilhan omar absolutely not i think this is this is always the point right there is always a an implied intent to every conversation i have and if you listen to the video one comparison of what the dungeons looked like and people being sold was to what s happening in north africa and the other one was of family separations and of course we obviously have a a crisis here with our family separation policies margaret brennan you feel very passionately about immigration you came to this country as a refugee representative ilhan omar i did margaret brennan the trump administration had a victory in the courts this week because representative ilhan omar mm hm margaret brennan at least temporarily they re upholding the ability of the administration to put into place new restrictions on the ability to claim asylum here representative ilhan omar i i believe that decision is morally and legally wrong seeking asylum is a legal right that people have and we know that the supreme court has been wrong before they ve been wrong in the equal but separation doctrine decision they ve been wrong in the dred scott decision and so what we now have an opportunity to do as legislators is make sure that we are creating immigration policy that is humane and just margaret brennan well the trump administration say they have to go and implement these regulations that their hands are being tied because congress just isn t doing its job representative ilhan omar all right we certainly in the house have been doing our job since the first day we got there and margaret brennan so do asylum rights as you argue need to be more specifically laid out are you working on something like that representative ilhan omar yeah we are trying to make sure that we fix our broken immigration system i mean people have to understand that the immigration crisis that we have is one that we could avoid and many of the policies that we ve been advocating for many that are currently sitting at the doorsteps of mitch mcconnell will create a positive impact on how our immigration system is carried out margaret brennan this was the anniversary this week the eighteenth of the 9 11 attacks on our country and at a ground zero well remembrance ceremony i ll call it the son of one of the victims stood up and specifically called out language you had used in the past that he characterized as not respectful when referring to the three thousand people who were killed by al qaeda you said some people did something and he put it right there on his t shirt representative ilhan omar mm hm margaret brennan do do you understand why people found that offensive representative ilhan omar i mean so 9 11 was an attack on all americans it was an attack on all of us and i certainly could not understand the weight of the pain that the victims of the the families of 9 11 must feel but i think it is really important for us to make sure that we are not forgetting right the aftermath of what happened after 9 11 many americans found themselves now having their civil rights stripped from them and so what i was speaking to was the fact that as a muslim margaret brennan mm hm representative ilhan omar not only was i suffering as an american who was attacked on that day but the next day i woke up as my fellow americans were now treating me a suspect margaret brennan do you do you feel like it s been tough for you here in washington to change your rhetoric to to be less of an activist and try to be a legislator that that sometimes the language you use has gotten in your own way representative ilhan omar i certainly don t think that you know when we were celebrating few nights ago i talked about how some people would say ilhan you should speak a certain way ilhan you should do something a certain way and i think that s contradictory really to the purpose of of my existence in this space i believe that my constituents sent me to make sure that i was bringing in a conversation that others weren t having that i was speaking for people who felt voiceless for a long time and i think it s really important for us to recognize that it s a new congress it s a diverse congress and we re not only diverse in our race or ethnicity or religion margaret brennan mm hm representative ilhan omar but we are also diverse in our perspective in our pain in our struggles and in the hopes and dreams that we have and the kind of america that we want to shape for all of us margaret brennan you were specifically banned by the prime minister of israel benjamin netanyahu from visiting that country representative ilhan omar mm hm margaret brennan he faces very tough election in the next few days if he doesn t win are you going to try to go back and and do you stand by your call for a boycott of israel representative ilhan omar i certainly hope that the people of israel make a different decision and my hope is that they recognize that his existence his policies his rhetoric really is contradictory to the peace that we are all hoping that that region receives and receives soon just right now if you look at the annexation that s taking place for many of us in congress there has been a longstanding support for its two state solution margaret brennan mm hm representative ilhan omar and this annexation now is going to make sure that that peace process does not happen and we will not get to a two state solution margaret brennan mm hm representative ilhan omar i think what is really important is for people to understand that you have to give people the opportunity to seek the kind of justice they want in a peaceful way and i think the opportunity to boycott divest sanction is the kind of pressure that leads to that peaceful process margaret brennan congresswoman thank you for coming here to face the nation representative ilhan omar thank you so much for having me margaret brennan we will be back in one minute with the administration s point person on legal immigration stay with us announcements margaret brennan we re back now with the acting director of u s citizenship and immigration services or uscis ken cuccinelli his agency is part of homeland security and it manages the processing of visas asylum claims and applications for citizenship good morning ken cuccinelli acting director of u s citizenship and immigration services usciscuccinelli good to be with you margaret margaret brennan you you were obviously directly impacted at your agency by the supreme court decision ken cuccinelli absolutely margaret brennan to up uphold the ability to enforce these new restrictions on being able to claim asylum what is the practical impact on the ground and when will it be felt ken cuccinelli so it s already being felt it isn t it wasn t from zero to a hundred as soon as the supreme court ruled we didn t know their timing but i can tell you that i spoke with mark morgan and matt albence the head of the other two immigration agencies on friday and we will be working closely with the department of justice where the immigration judges sit and we re ramping this up as quickly as we can logistically we ll we ll do it in the places where we have the logistics in place fastest first and then move it all the way across the border but this will be measured in days not weeks margaret brennan so to explain this restricts the ability of people to claim asylum if they haven t first tried to claim asylum and been denied in a country they were passing through ken cuccinelli they passed through that s right margaret brennan en route to the united states but claiming asylum is the legal channel of asylum so of of trying to immigrate so if you re cutting off that legal channel aren t you just going to push people towards illegal immigration ken cuccinelli well most of the people coming in that are claiming asylum on the southern border are coming in illegally already margaret brennan but if they re crossing illegally but still declaring asylum they re going through the legal channel if they re declaring themselves to a border patrol officer ken cuccinelli right and so we have different rules in different places i don t think a lot of people realize this but the northern border we have an agreement with canada where you can claim asylum in either canada or the united states but not both under any circumstances it s actually a more restrictive arrangement than we have now on the southern border so the the circumstances that we face on our southern border are still crisis circumstances and we have a three hundred and thirty five thousand asylum case backlog which i take very seriously and it has creeped up while i have been here despite us throwing more and more resources at trying to drive it down there are legitimate asylum claims in there margaret brennan mm hm ken cuccinelli some of them have been waiting over two years and we take very seriously the need to get to those people unfortunately this system is clogged up with a lot of fraudulent claims margaret brennan but as you just said sometimes there are very legitimate claims of asylum ken cuccinelli oh yeah absolutely margaret brennan fear for your life and that is where the controversy is not just around the legality but the morality of it i mean ronald reagan talked about this country as a shining city on the hill and you were building a big moat around it ken cuccinelli well that s not how we view it obviously but i mean we at the same time my agency is you know creating more citizens than you ve seen in years we have we have a five year high last year and we ll break that again this year so margaret brennan but this is tens of thousands ken cuccinelli yes but you just described margaret brennan of people who will not be able to claim asylum ken cuccinelli okay but you just described us as trying to build a moat around it and i m pointing out that in the legal process we re moving along at a good clip we have a crisis at the southern border and this is just one of the many responses we ve had the president has been very clear about the need to be aggressive on the border and that s exactly what we re doing margaret brennan so are you essentially arguing that this is going to be a deterrent where people just won t even try to come ken cuccinelli there will there will be margaret brennan because asylum claim claiming asylum is a legal ken cuccinelli yes margaret i understand margaret brennan means of immigration ken cuccinelli and your point is an excellent one it will be a deterrent for some people particularly those who were going to be coming and claiming what are clearly false asylum claims people and remember asylum is about safety we do want people margaret brennan right ken cuccinelli to be safe the and the reality is america s the most generous country in the world on this front but we have to deal with the crisis we re facing down there this will be a deterrent to some coming who are making particularly false claims margaret brennan very quickly on that note the bahamas was just slammed with a horrific hurricane ken cuccinelli dorian yes margaret brennan why change it and make it harder for people to flee to this country this past monday by now requiring visas just a lot of good reasons people wouldn t have their paperwork ken cuccinelli well cbp has actually extended itself out into the bahamas which they i don t ever remember them doing before we re actually making this a lot more accommodationist so realize that the northern two islands were hit grand bahama has electricity and the basics back the bahamas is a perfectly legitimate country capable of taking care of their own we rushed resources in margaret brennan mm hm ken cuccinelli whether it was from uscid or the coast guard who were downright heroic in there margaret brennan mm hm ken cuccinelli and border patrol assets were moved in there as well to make hundreds of saves margaret brennan i m i m i appreciate everything you re saying i m running out of time i m being told so i got to leave it ken cuccinelli understand margaret brennan there unfortunately we re going to be right back announcements margaret brennan today is the fifty sixth anniversary of the 16th street baptist church bombing in birmingham alabama which killed four young girls including a friend of former secretary of state condoleezza rice who was an eight year old at the time up next we will speak with her about race as well as the changing role of the united states announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation earlier we sat down with president george w bush s secretary of state condoleezza rice she now teaches at stanford university and is the co author of a new book to build a better world choices to end the cold war and create a global commonwealth begin vt margaret brennan president trump represents a very different kind of foreign policy for the republican party it s more isolationist than republicans like yourself have been in the past do you think that s more reflective of where the party is now condoleezza rice former secretary of state condoleezzarice i don t know where the party is but i certainly believe that president trump is speaking to something that s in the country if you think back to the interview that president barack obama did with jeffrey goldberg in the atlantic just before he left office there are really a lot of echoes of what you hear with president trump he talked about allies being kind of free riders there was this sort of anger and frustration sounding through about allies and what they do and so this has been coming for some time probably a little bit of exhaustion with the the wars and terrorism and vigilance but the fact is the american people have kind of two impulses simultaneously one is we re tired of those burdens of leadership can t somebody else do it you hear that in echoed by president trump and earlier by president obama but they also don t want to see syrian babies choking on nerve gas they don t want to see people beheaded on tv as isis was doing they don t want to see vladimir putin laying waste to his neighbors or venezuelans starving because they have a bad government and so what the president has to do is to activate the part of america that wants to continue to lead and sometimes i think you get that from this administration margaret brennan is there an identity that defines republican foreign policy now condoleezza rice i don t know if there s an identity that defines foreign policy in either party the united states is going through a transformative period in which we are leaving one era the era in which the united states emerged really the sole superpower after the end of the cold war then there was a period of having to deal with terrorism margaret brennan mm hm condoleezza rice and the attacks that we had the anniversary of on september 11th now we re facing all of these new challenges what do you do about cybersecurity what do you do about ungoverned spaces where terrorists train but where you can t go in directly what do you do about the rise of great powers like china what do you do about the efforts of a declining power like russia to disrupt the international system the problems are different and i think we re going to have to come to a new consensus about what really principles are going to guide american foreign policy i hope that there will be some echoes of the old principles that america is going to be involved that without the united states the world is a more chaotic place i hope that those principles will involve patience margaret brennan in the book to build a better world you say you wrote it because you think the world is drifting towards another systemic crisis is this a warning condoleezza rice i hope it s a bit of a wake up call when we see the rise of what we ve called the four horsemen of the apocalypse populism that says don t believe in those institutions those institutions you go around them directly to the people well there are some dangers in that when you see the rise of what i ll call nativism i i think saying it s nationalism for americans nationalism is not a bad thing it s not bad to be proud of patriotic toward your country nativism though pits you against them when you see isolationism when you see protectionism growing the whole idea that the international economy is better if people trade countries trade freely when you see that under attack i do think we re drifting toward a systemic crisis margaret brennan but those four things you just outlined sound a lot like what defines trumpism condoleezza rice but it s not just what defines some of the president s policies america first for instance it defines a lot of what you re hearing across the world it defines what you re hearing in great britain with brexit it defines what you hear from the five star movement in italy it defines what you hear in brazil with with bolsonaro so the question is why are we getting this response and elites can t sit back and say oh you re just wrong margaret brennan mm hm condoleezza rice there has to be some self evaluation of how late stage capitalism is dealing with some of the new challenges margaret brennan do you think republicans are doing enough to push back against those four horsemen condoleezza rice well i do think that you see people pushing back on very specific circumstances now let s be fair when it comes to some foreign policy issues that i was dealing with a decade ago you have to give the administration credit for having taken them on north korea margaret brennan mm hm condoleezza rice nobody has been able to solve the north korean problem i don t have a problem with how they are going about that i would say that on iran they are pushing back correctly on an iranian regime that is the most dangerous and disruptive regime in the middle east margaret brennan should president trump meet with president rouhani condoleezza rice i have no problem negotiating with the iranians but you have to do it when the conditions are right when you have a negotiation that looks like the taliban is not going to even recognize the legitimate democratically elected government of afghanistan not going to recognize the constitution now you have to step back and say is this time really to negotiate when you re negotiating from a position of strength margaret brennan mm hm condoleezza rice as i think we would be with the iranians or with the north koreans because the sanctions have weakened those economies that s that s fine when your partner or your adversary thinks that they have the upper hand which i think the taliban thinks because they think we want to get out so badly we ll we ll take anything then i think you have to stop and say this may not be the time to negotiate margaret brennan do you think that the president needs to be taking more care on those issues when he discusses race and when he discusses immigrants condoleezza rice i do and i ve said i think that particularly from the white house you need language that recognizes how raw race is as a factor in america i grew up in a segregated birmingham alabama all right i understand race and racism and the like but i m i m going to tell you margaret i think that we could all be better in the way that we deal with this very raw nerve which is race i think it s time to stop labeling each other and using explosive terms like she is a racist he is a racist that that stops the conversation right when you say that that s meant to stop the conversation and we need to have a conversation we also need to and i say this very often to my students you know identity is a wonderful and marvelous thing i am tremendously proud of my ancestors who survived the horrors of slavery came out of it and by the time of my grandfather were being college educated i m tremendously proud of that legacy but i also know that identity has to be something that you don t use against others margaret brennan mm hm condoleezza rice and so to the degree that we are breaking ourselves into ever smaller groups with ever larger senses of grievance and ever different narratives i don t think anybody is doing very well at helping us to navigate this extraordinarily difficult minefield of race end vt margaret brennan our full conversation with secretary rice is on our website facethenation com we ll be right back with another former diplomat president obama s united nations ambassador samantha power announcements margaret brennan we re back now with former u s ambassador to the united nations samantha power she has a new memoir out it s called the education of an idealist thank you for being here samantha power former u s ambassador to the u n the education of an idealist a memoir samanthajpower great to be here margaret brennan does being an idealist survive working in the white house samantha power definitely but you do have to learn how to prosecute your ideals so the story i tell is not one of going in naive about how easy it will be to promote human rights from washington but i went in knowing it d be hard and then learned how to build coalitions learned how to work with other countries to fight things like the ebola epidemic or get political prisoners out of jail but you do have to keep learning and be self critical as you go and that s a story i tell margaret brennan secretary rice you heard her just there lay out a number of things she said were very similar between president trump and president obama in terms of responding to this strong reaction against military intervention this idea that you know the system needs to be completely changed and that allies aren t shouldering more of the burden do you see those same similarities samantha power we could not be more different in fact it s true that in the wake of the disastrous invasion of iraq and the overstretch and the militarization of our foreign policy after 9 11 generally that there is a fatigue in the country that part i agree with but there is a major difference between the current approach of attacking our democratic institutions at home undermining our ability to lead internationally attacking our allies cozying up to abusive regimes alienating everybody so if you need them in the face of a crisis it s going to be very hard to pick up the phone and actually get people to come into your coalitions a big difference between that which is the present and what we did which was strengthen our alliances yes call on allies to do more the united states can t share the can t shoulder the burden alone absolutely that is the case but you can do so in a manner that still preserves the relationships deepens the relationships and ensures that when you go and try to end iran s nuclear program you get not only the european allies at the table with you but also russia and china for all of the difficulties there when you go and try to broker an agreement to curb climate change you go first to china and are actually able to forge that agreement margaret brennan mm hm samantha power and then you take it global and bring other countries on board and you re able to build a seventy eight nation coalition to defeat isis which is something that president trump has carried through but he couldn t build that coalition today there s no way after the reckless foreign policy that s been pursued margaret brennan you built your career you won a pulitzer prize around talking about human rights law in particular genocide and you re clear in your book that you morally had some problems with president samantha power and strategically margaret brennan and strategically but with president obama s decision not to strike syria in the wake of those devastating chemical weapons attacks general mattis called that the shot not heard around the world samantha power mm hm margaret brennan why didn t you resign samantha power well first of all in the book what i tried to do is bring readers into the situation room so they see just the complexity of decisions like that one and when you are in the situation room and you re looking at the deaths of fourteen hundred people and you re seeing refugee flows out of syria that have the capacity as they would go on to do to destabilize countries not just syria itself you see five hundred thousand lives ultimately taken in syria there are a whole set of imperatives that grow out of that at the same time the u s congress would not support president obama margaret brennan mm hm samantha power when he went to them and say hey let s do this together let s make sure that assad can t wait us out margaret brennan right samantha power and just start gassing again and then we re in a position where we re have where we re divided domestically so our foreign policy is going to be stronger if we can heal some of these divisions at home and without that kind of base for acting internationally especially when it comes to the use of military force i think president obama again i happen to take a different position but but ultimately it is very hard to be a leader when the rug is being pulled out from you particularly by the opposition party margaret brennan but assad has now essentially won that war samantha power he has absolutely consolidated control over territory but it s not the case necessarily when you ask why i didn t resign and i go into that at length in the book because a lot of people asked me that at the time margaret brennan i mean people ask that question now about the trump administration on matters of principle why continue to serve and not resign if you object samantha power well again i would i would draw distinctions between locking children up in cages and so forth and making i think a reasonable decision that u s military force alone would not have brought the war to an end i thought perhaps in the wake of the gas attack we could catalyze diplomacy it was a limited strike of the kind that i i thought would not lead to entanglement president obama agreed he was pursuing military force and again congress did not support him in that regard reflecting i think the larger skepticism among the american people but what i show in the book is how much good you can do from these jobs and i was really fortunate to be a member of the president s cabinet to be able to launch a campaign to get female political prisoners out of jail and to actually succeed in getting them out of jail to be able to build a coalition on pres with president obama margaret brennan mm hm samantha power and secretary kerry to end the ebola epidemic in west africa when people had predicted that more than one billion people would die so one you know we are divided as secretary rice indicated the reason i chose to tell a very personal story was to open up just how meaningful this work can be and to show again the complexity of decisions and to show that not everything is as binary and gets at the sort of gotcha politics that we have today margaret brennan yeah samantha power that there are good flesh and blood people inside government inside of public institutions generally who are trying to make the world better and who do in fact succeed margaret brennan you helped shepherd through the paris climate change accord which now every democrat running for president says they are going to rejoin but you you also say that s not sufficient to meet the level of threat right now so what else needs to happen samantha power well first and foremost we have to meet the commitments that we made in the paris agreement i mean one of the things president obama did was had us bring the paris agreement into law international law quicker than any international climate or environmental agreement ever worried that in case the november 2016 election margaret brennan right samantha power went a different way then the agreement itself would collapse so the agreement still exists globally but the commitments we made were a floor and everybody was very clear on that so we ve got to get into it meet our commitments and then be much more ambitious in terms of what we do domestically and critically and this is margaret brennan mm hm samantha power why u s leadership is so catalytically important we leverage the commitments we make the sacrifices we make to get other countries to do far more that s how the global system works when it does margaret brennan ambassador it s a personal memoir you talk a lot about being a a working woman and the challenges of of being pregnant and juggling all that at the same time it s a good read samantha power to which you can relate margaret brennan it it was a good read samantha power thank you margaret brennan thank you for joining us we ll be back in a moment with a look at how americans view climate change announcements man 1 from cbs washington in color face the nation a spontaneous and unrehearsed news interview man 2 april 19 1970 senator nelson congressman mccloskey next wednesday is earth day david culhane april 19 1970 what are people going to do about when they find out that this cleaning up of the environment might involve less use of automobiles by them senator gaylord nelson april 19 1970 within twenty five years most major metropolitan areas in in america if we don t stop it you will not be able to stay outdoors more than two or three hours without a serious health hazard you ll have to go out your kids will go outdoors and play in gas masks margaret brennan that was the very first time we had an extended conversation about the environment on face the nation and that dire prediction of children having to wear gas masks while playing outside did not come true but almost fifty years later more than six in ten americans see climate change as a crisis or serious problem and more than half say we need to act now our cbs news poll out today also shows that just one in ten americans say human activity does not contribute at all to climate change this week cbs news along with more than two hundred and fifty news outlets worldwide is participating in covering the climate now project we ll be looking at the challenges and the political discord on what causes climate change and how we can fix it our poll also shows that two in three americans trust their meteorologists for information about climate change so who better to kick off this special series than cbs own climate and weather contributor jeff berardelli jeff good to have you here jeff berardelli meteorologist weatherprof cbs news climate and weather contributor good to be here margaret brennan so part of the political argument around climate change is whether or not man plays a role in it what does the science tell us jeff berardelli yeah so unequivocally the science believes that it s caused by human beings by our burning of fossil fuels and our release of these heat trapping greenhouse gases ninety seven plus percent of scientists there is a consensus agree that it s caused by humans these are the scientists that study it day in and day out it s actually probably closer to around ninety nine percent or so the last five years have been the hottest on earth it is the warmest it s been in modern human history maybe even going back tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of years i mean we are a force of nature there are 7 6 billion people on this earth right now and obviously things are changing pretty quickly because of that margaret brennan and the argument you you have heard even members of the trump administration say the climate is not definitive what you re laying out is a very different description and in our polling we re seeing that americans are willing to do things that they think will help the environment jeff berardelli okay margaret brennan recycle use energy efficient light bulbs plastic bags at stores do those things make a dent in the problem you re describing jeff berardelli so each individual thing we do doesn t but if we have conversations and society starts to become more sustainable kind of a grassroots thing where you know the low hanging fruit you only have to do the little things and those lead to better habits and kind of rub off on the people around you your your family your friends have the conversations and that starts a grassroots movement from the bottom at the same time we need it to come from the top as well so yes it does make a difference not the individual let s say plastic bottle that we re not using but not using a plastic bottle hopefully leads to better habits in your life and in the lives of people around you we need to become more sustainable with this earth margaret brennan we have seen some really powerful storms and hurricanes are those driven by what you re describing with the climate changes jeff berardelli yes so absolutely that s part of it so first of all ocean heat content has been rising and set sets records every single year about ninety three percent of the excess heat that s trapped by greenhouse gases gets stored in our ocean thankfully otherwise we d be burning up right now the problem is is all that builds up in the ocean and comes back as extreme weather so first of all we have hurricane cycles that are natural and right now we think we re in a natural uptick these cycles last around twenty to thirty years in the atlantic basin however on top of that we ve warmed the earth by around one degree celsius about two degrees fahrenheit and there is research out there that shows that for every one degree of global warming we see a a disproportionate number of cat 4s and cat 5s margaret brennan mm hm jeff berardelli it increases by twenty five to thirty percent the number of cat 4s and cat 5s we see it with storms like irma and dorian which just demolished the bahamas and and here s the craziest part of this compare a storm with winds of a hundred and eighty five miles an hour to a storm with winds of seventy five miles an hour you might think to yourself okay twice as much damage three times as much damage four times as much damage no it s thirteen hundred times the damage potential margaret brennan wow jeff berardelli for a storm with winds of a hundred and eighty five like dorian or a low end hurricane that s why just an increase in twenty or thirty miles an hour because of climate change margaret brennan yeah jeff berardelli makes a world of difference in terms of damage margaret brennan so when we talk about solutions to this the paris climate change accord that the obama administration joined the trump administration says it s pulling out of it locked in or tried to lock in temperature rises at just what two degrees celsius jeff berardelli yeah margaret brennan that you heard from ambassador power say that s not enough yet jeff berardelli it it s it s true margaret brennan but it s something jeff berardelli right exactly margaret brennan so why does two degrees make that much of a difference jeff berardelli okay so two degrees celsius is close to four degrees fahrenheit it s actually about three and a half degrees fahrenheit so think about this you know it doesn t sound like a lot a couple of degrees doesn t sound like a lot but let s say that your body temperature goes up by three or four degrees the earth s system is just as sensitive as your body if your body goes up from ninety nine to a hundred and three degrees your bodily functions begin to break down same thing in the earth margaret brennan it s like a fever jeff berardelli same thing in the earth everything is very sensitive everything is very interconnected and things begin to break down that s what we re concerned about margaret brennan what s the impact on the economy jeff berardelli it s a huge impact especially as we head decades forward right now we re already seeing a lot more billion dollar disasters so it s already impacting us but think about this if the seas rise two three four feet look at all the real trillions of dollars of real estate is in the way of that also it s going to desertify climate change will desertify large areas of productive agriculture so people won t be able to make a living anymore they will migrate it forces international migration picture the time when instead of ten thousand people kind of knocking at your door we have a hundred thousand people margaret brennan mm hm jeff berardelli knocking at our door it causes international instability what i would say margaret brennan right jeff berardelli is there are things we can do renewable energy is something everybody agrees on republicans and democrats and so we should move forward fast margaret brennan thank you for connecting all those dots for us jeff berardelli you re welcome my pleasure margaret brennan next week we will talk with former secretary of state john kerry he negotiated that paris climate change accord in the obama administration that s next sunday on face the nation we ll be back in a moment announcements margaret brennan that s it for us today thank you for watching but before we go we want to thank the
