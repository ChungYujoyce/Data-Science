advertisement supported by transcript dems debate by patrick healy and amy chozick senator bernie sanders seizing on potential vulnerabilities for hillary clinton in the coming new york primary repeatedly savaged her ties to wealthy donors and wall street banks during their debate on thursday night delivering a ferocious performance that mrs clinton countered with steely confidence and her own sharp elbows mr sanders hoping to humiliate mrs clinton in her adopted home state in tuesday s primary bluntly challenged her fitness for the presidency saying she had the experience and intelligence for the job but adding i do question her judgment he listed her most controversial actions over the years from voting to authorize the american invasion of iraq to supporting some free trade deals and taking 675 000 in speaking fees from goldman sachs while he did not repeat his recent remark that she was unqualified to be president he constantly edged up to the line do we really feel confident about a candidate who says she will bring change in america when she is so dependent on big money interests mr sanders asked i don t think so mrs clinton fought back hard especially in a fierce exchange over israel as the two candidates played to a rambunctious and roaring audience at the brooklyn navy yard a classic new york crowd that interrupted booed and cheered in sports arena style creating a highly charged atmosphere the forum also revealed the increasing animosity between mr sanders and mrs clinton who no longer offer each other the polite rejoinders and carefully couched criticisms that characterized the early part of the campaign feisty and frequently sarcastic mr sanders could barely contain his disgust with mrs clinton s ties with wall street a ripe target among liberals in new york city and in economically depressed upstate regions after mrs clinton said she had stood up to bankers and called them out on their shaky financial practices before the recession mr sanders delivered his retort with the flair of a veteran broadway actor secretary clinton called them out oh my goodness they must have been really crushed by this mr sanders said and was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements mrs clinton who is comfortably ahead in polls of new york voters seemed to relish taking swings at mr sanders make no mistake about it this is not just an attack on me it s an attack on president obama mrs clinton said about the criticism of her use of a super pac and her acceptance of big money contributions as many audience members booed mrs clinton grinned a little before saying this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support to undergird the insinuations mr sanders needs a landslide victory in new york to improve his slim chances at the democratic nomination and throughout the debate he appeared on the hunt for any new advantage he highlighted a recent report about the failure of banks to plan for their own demise as evidence that his regulatory plans and not mrs clinton s were tough enough to rein in bank executives he pointed to some polls indicating that he would be a stronger opponent than mrs clinton in a general election against donald j trump if he wins the republican nomination mrs clinton showed a determination to deal a devastating blow to mr sanders in the new york primary and she sought to lay the groundwork on thursday night with the issue of israel which evolved into one of the more memorable exchanges of the evening in new york where candidates traditionally compete with one another to align themselves with israel s interests it was startling to see a major democratic candidate mr sanders unapologetically challenge the actions of the israeli government and call for evenhanded treatment of palestinians if we are ever going to bring peace to that region mr sanders said we are going to have to treat the palestinian people with respect and dignity he added that does not make me anti israel mrs clinton jumped on her rival i negotiated the cease fire between israel and hamas in november of 2012 she said they do not seek this kind of attacks they do not invite rockets parading down on their towns and villages according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president mr sanders said mrs clinton was evading a major issue whether she believes that israel responds disproportionately to attacks such as during the 2014 assault on gaza and he was sharply critical of mrs clinton s stance on palestinians twice bringing up her recent speech to the american israel public affairs committee an influential pro israel lobbying group i heard almost no discussion at all about the needs of the palestinian people he said of the speech mr sanders came in for some of his toughest treatment from the debate moderators led by wolf blitzer and dana bash of cnn who questioned him aggressively about his grasp of banking regulations and his struggle to provide policy details during an interview with the daily news s editorial board ms bash also challenged mr sanders to give an example of how mrs clinton was unduly influenced by big banks to which he cited the financial excesses and greed that led to the recession the obvious response to that is that you ve got a bunch of fraudulent operations and they ve got to be broken up mr sanders said now secretary clinton was busy giving speeches to goldman sachs for 225 000 a speech so the proper response in my view is we should break them up mrs clinton drew strong applause when she bluntly said her opponent had dodged the question adding he cannot come up with any example because there is no example the debate was in many ways the sum of the previous eight mr sanders has grown steadily more assertive and combative since the democrats first debate in october when he passed up opportunities to attack mrs clinton over her iraq war vote and her speaking fees from goldman sachs he now raises those issues almost daily in an attempt to win over voters by drawing sharp contrasts between his and mrs clinton s policy records he has also been trying to appeal to a broader audience including african americans and hispanics beyond the liberals and young people who were his focus in the early debates mrs clinton has remained a polished and nimble performer throughout the debate season which nearly ended in march as the two campaigns bickered about holding a debate in new york before the primary the campaigns have also discussed holding one in may perhaps in california before its june 7 primary though no final agreement has been reached as aggressive as mr sanders acted in the debate he has very limited ability to overtake mrs clinton in their critical competition to amass the 2 383 delegates needed to win the democratic nomination despite his winning seven of the last eight primaries and caucuses he continues to trail mrs clinton by 220 pledged delegates and his chances of catching up are about to get harder the new york primary will open a period in which the map of nomination contests shifts back in mrs clinton s favor with several large states holding primaries instead of caucuses the most uncomfortable moment for mrs clinton came when the debate turned to the 1994 crime bill which put 100 000 more police officers on the streets built new prisons and banned certain types of assault weapons the bill which mr sanders voted for and mrs clinton supported as first lady has been widely criticized as contributing to the mass incarceration of african americans and to tensions between police officers and black communities mr sanders minced no words about mrs clinton s use of the term superpredators to describe urban gang members in a 1996 speech and he explained why he had criticized former president bill clinton this week for standing up for mrs clinton on the issue it was a racist term and everybody knew it was a racist term he said setting off rousing cheers from the crowd mrs clinton has said she regrets using the term and on thursday night she had no problem putting the blame for the crime bill on her husband he was the president who actually signed it she said mrs clinton continually tried to make her opponent appear less versed on policy nuances frequently diving into in depth policy issues asked about her paid speeches to wall street banks she pivoted saying she was the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives as senator sanders did pressed again to release the transcripts of her paid speeches mrs clinton called on mr sanders to release his tax returns mr sanders in response said he would release his 2014 tax returns on friday the audience frequently seemed on the side of mr sanders with many people chanting along with him as he said his average campaign contribution was 27 but mrs clinton also earned cheers which she acknowledged with a knowing smile as she cast herself as the hometown candidate i love being in brooklyn this is great
