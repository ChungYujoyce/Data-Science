 politics the party is doing opposition research on mike pence john kasich nikki haley and others by gabriel debenedetti 08 22 2017 05 27 am edt vice president mike pence has built up his political operation both inside and outside the white house brendan smialowski afp getty images the democratic national committee is conducting full scale opposition research on multiple republicans it believes could challenge president donald trump for reelection or are likely to run if he does not the effort which began in late spring covers vice president mike pence ohio gov john kasich united nations ambassador nikki haley and nebraska sen ben sasse among others advertisement with trump s tumultuous presidency in complete chaos we are prepared for all scenarios said dnc research director lauren dillon confirming the campaign to politico in the case of republicans like pence and kasich the team of over two dozen dnc researchers is mostly updating the existing research books they deployed in 2016 according to democrats familiar with the arrangement for the others the operatives are combing through voting and governing records compiling financial files searching for conflicts of interest and saving clips on their relationships with trump for an opposition party to be scrutinizing potential intraparty reelection rivals to an incumbent president just seven months into his term is highly unusual but the start of the trump presidency marked by unprecedented staff turnover the appointment of an independent counsel and a perpetual state of chaos has been nothing if not unusual in recent months the democratic staff has increased the pace of its freedom of information act style records requests in multiple states it has dispatched researchers to courthouses to collect legal records pertaining to the potential candidates among the destinations so far indiana where pence served as governor until january the topic of a 2020 election without trump as the nominee is an extremely delicate one for republicans pence and his aides publicly lashed out earlier this month after a new york times report suggested he and others were prepping for potential runs if trump were to pass on

president trump and vice president pence pence press secretary marc lotter told politico in response to a question about the dnc effort trump has a team working on his 2020 reelection bid already and presidential primary challenges are once in a generation occurrences the last one was in 1992 when pat buchanan failed in his attempt to oust president george h w bush but with trump s approval rating falling to dangerous lows and fellow gop leaders publicly opposing him more frequently than ever before operatives on both sides have pointed to other republicans activities as evidence of their interest in running pence has built up his political operation both inside and outside the white house for example and kasich has refused to rule out the possibility of a run while loudly criticizing the president though he has said he is not planning to take trump on sasse another trump critic drew notice among trump s allies by appearing in iowa earlier this year the potential candidates aides brush off questions about their ambitions i think the democrats would be better served coming up with a better economic policy rather than planning to rely on trump s unpopularity said kasich s political adviser john weaver u n ambassador nikki haley is among a handful of republicans who are being closely watched by national democrats pablo martinez monsivais ap photo how democrats waste their money is up to them but this is pretty funny added sasse spokesman james wegmann haley spokesman john degory offered i don t know or have anything to share on that operatives on both sides of the aisle preparing for 2020 have also started speculating about the intentions of sens ted cruz of texas tom cotton of arkansas and marco rubio of florida as well as former republican nominee mitt romney needless to say there is no historical precedent for this kind of challenge to a sitting president this early in his term i do think it s important to begin to have these discussions if for no other reason than to make it clear that there remain republicans unstained by trump s presidency said charlie sykes a veteran influential conservative radio host based in wisconsin white house by alex isenstadt nonetheless there s no consensus around the usefulness of an early effort like the dnc s multiple democrats and republicans noted that each recent case in which a president received a primary challenge ended with a significantly weakened commander in chief winning his party s nomination but losing reelection and a scenario in which trump were not running at all would also signal a massive shift in the electoral landscape to get to the point where another candidate is even considered the circumstances that would compel or permit such a change would have to be so remarkable so sweeping so unprecedented that any oppo research on a particular candidate would be rendered moot by the very circumstances that occasioned the change said tom rath a longtime republican strategist in new hampshire and a former state attorney general who advised kasich in 2016 rath added i would think if i were a dem i would really want to run against trump in 20 rather than any one else democrats are expected to have a messy primary with dozens of candidates of their own and republicans are amassing their own research in advance of that contest the gop opposition research firm america rising has publicly launched efforts against new york gov andrew cuomo and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren much like they did against hillary clinton before the 2016 election cycle the republican national committee meanwhile has roughly 20 staff members divided between its war room and research office tracking public statements by and issuing public record requests on a range of democrats aiming to identify the potential candidates top vulnerabilities white house by matthew nussbaum and brent d griffiths the dnc effort is not the lone attempt to kick start preparations for a 2020 race that includes republicans other than trump democratic opposition research group american bridge has assigned three staffers to a pence project of its own buzzfeed reported last week but the dnc s push is the largest in scale so far ahead of the election it s a reflection of the committee s trump era focus on research as central to its efforts while the organization s staff tends to disband after presidential elections then dnc chair donna brazile kept the full research team intact last year and it remained in place to zero in on trump when the new chairman tom perez took over in february but it s also a move to shore up the party s files on potential 2024 candidates democrats had little research done on trump when he announced he was running unlike the six years worth of planning they had done for romney by the time he launched his 2012 campaign the glossy bound research file distributed by american bridge to reporters in 2014 famously did not even include a section on trump while american bridge had started building files on likely 2020 candidates by october 2016 when it looked like clinton would cruise past trump that effort stalled after the election so this new campaign not only signals to the rest of the party that its 2020 preparations should begin in earnest just seven months into trump s first term it s also an attempt to avoid being caught flat footed said erik smith a senior adviser to both of barack obama s presidential campaigns it s much harder he said to compile analyze and summarize opposition research in the heat of a campaign missing out on the
