 2016 how the republican national committee got stuck between angry gop campaigns and hungry tv networks by kyle cheney 10 30 2015 10 34 pm edt rnc chairman reince priebus has been particularly critical of cnbc s handling of the gop debate getty halfway through wednesday s off the rails cnbc debate republican national committee chairman reince priebus realized he was witnessing a chain reaction wreck by the time it ended he knew it was headed straight for him priebus has always been keenly aware that the republican party has become increasingly vulnerable to outside forces starting with the unexpected emergence this year of uncontrollable to hell with the establishment candidates like donald trump and ben carson but outrage over the third gop debate during which the candidates and grassroots conservatives attacked the media with a lusty vengeance posed a new threat and priebus has been fighting ferociously to maintain control of a process he believes is central to reviving the party s battered brand and preserving the rnc s relevance advertisement over the past two days the 43 year old wisconsinite has been burning out his iphone battery working the lines constantly to head off a revolt by campaigns who want to wrestle the process away from the rnc to suit their individual agendas in addition to rebuking cnbc his subtle message to the gop candidates was simple we ve got your back former rnc chairman michael steele said the move appeared to be as much about keeping the rnc as the steward of the debate process as it was about a cover our ass strategy for the committee knowing that its presidential candidates are frustrated and contemplating going rogue you take control of the process you got to live with the consequences steele said the candidates are now no longer trusting the system they re no longer trusting the process the candidates are pissed off because they thought they were going to be placed into an arena where policy would be discussed not when was the last time you hit your wife it has grown from two or three candidates being pissed off to now all of them hours after the debate ended top aides to trump and carson who believed their candidates had been manhandled by liberal headhunters masquerading as neutral network moderators ordered up a sunday evening meeting along with representatives from second tier denizens lindsey graham and bobby jindal to discuss the fate of the remaining six plus debates the rnc wasn t invited though it disputes the nature of the meeting suggesting it s been communicating with campaigns who plan to submit a list of joint demands for future debates each candidate had motives for wanting to revisit a process that had been negotiated by the rnc months earlier according to people in trump s orbit the real estate mogul and reality tv star wanted to keep the debates shorter two hours instead of unwieldy three hour marathons staged to maximize ad revenue and more tightly managed in part to limit his exposure to constant incoming fire in part to assert his skills as a deal maker in part to minimize the perception his bombast is pumping up the more likeable carson there s a camaraderie that s been developed between some key campaign leaders that is a good thing said a source close to trump and i think it s an insight into how he s able to work with others and wants to work with others and he succeeded in the last debate in terms of setting the terms another successful negotiation will only reinforce his strength the rnc began trying to cope with the fallout even before the debate ended the bush campaign among others believed their candidate was being shorted on airtime a complaint furiously relayed to officials at the financial news network in real time as the candidates unloaded on cnbc and the media priebus conspicuously joined the chorus blasting the moderators afterward for asking gotcha questions and creating a hostile environment the trouble began even before the combatants took the stage on wednesday there were disputes over the quality of some candidates green rooms the network was debating stretching the debate a few more money making minutes contending that its two hour timeframe shouldn t include the time spent on commercials then during the debate cnbc moderators backtracked on what republican candidates said was an agreement to allow for opening statements instead asking them to identify their greatest weaknesses a moment later moderator john harwood asked trump if he was running the comic book version of a presidential campaign then campaigns began complaining about unequal speaking time and in the end a scuffling jeb bush ended up with the least amount of airtime bush campaign manager danny diaz confronted cnbc about the imbalance and rnc chief strategist sean spicer was seen in an animated conversation with harwood as the post debate spin room emptied several campaigns had a concern about time allotments we approached cnbc on multiple occasions to give us a readout of times as they promised and they refused spicer told politico a cnbc source with direct knowledge of the conversations said that bush was the only candidate mentioned by name all that did little to stem the vitriol or stop trump carson graham and jindal from taking matters into their hands priebus huddling with his staff and consulting senior republicans around the country hastily arranged a call of the rnc s leadership and debate committee friday morning to reassert control of a process that seemed to be spiraling out control by hadas gold and kyle cheney we re serious this isn t for show said debates committee chairman steve duprey an rnc committeeman from new hampshire in a phone interview no network should be proud of that debate participants in the call said it was scheduled just 30 minutes ahead of time and that the sentiment driven by the chairman was unanimous the party s relationship with nbc should be suspended even if it turns out to just be a slap on the wrist at the time of the call the details of the next scheduled debate the nov 10 meeting on fox business network had yet to be hammered out by the campaigns and networks in any event the rnc needed to do something bold and symbolic an action that would strike a blow against cnbc s parent company nbc universal which many republicans view as being in the tank for democrats priebus greeted his people and immediately pitched the idea of suspending the party s relationship with the network which had been scheduled to host another debate in february in partnership with telemundo and national review the venerable conservative magazine we simply cannot continue with nbc without full consultation with our campaigns the cnbc network is one of your media properties and its handling of the debate was conducted in bad faith priebus wrote in a letter he tweeted out on friday questions were inaccurate or downright offensive the first question directed to one of our candidates asked if he was running a comic book version of a presidential campaign hardly in the spirit of how the debate was billed this is a disappointing development however along with our debate partners at telemundo we will work in good faith to resolve this matter with the republican party nbc news meekly replied but it was more than just a rebuke to the network the rnc s move was an intentional and unsubtle signal to presidential campaigns who have been in open conflict with the committee we have your back the move came just hours after politico reported that the trump carson graham jindal powwow would take place on sunday and the main topic would be benching the rnc and negotiating terms with the networks either as a group or individually trouble had been brewing for a while in the weeks leading up to the cnbc debate there were intense behind the scenes discussions between the campaigns the rnc and cnbc at issue the network s refusal to allow opening and closing statements several campaigns including trump s threatened to pull out if they didn t get them cnbc ultimately backed off telling the rnc which was negotiating on the campaigns behalf it would allow an open ended opening statement but cnbc reversed course as soon as the lights went on in 30 seconds without telling us that you try too hard or that you re a perfectionist co moderator carl quintanilla began what is your biggest weakness and what are you doing to address it the debate went downhill from there as the candidates openly bristled at the questions and whipped up the crowd against the hosts by hadas gold the fight wasn t limited to republicans and the media it also unmasked long simmering frustrations between the rnc and some of its candidates who say the committee has left them at the mercy of tv networks intent on turning the primary into a hunger games style battle for survival after the first two debates on aug 6 bottom of the pack candidates began sniping at the rnc accusing the committee of having its thumb on the scale because it declined to encourage members to attend the undercard event soon afterwards the rnc began holding twice monthly calls with campaign representatives to keep lines of dialogue open but those calls quickly became venting sessions for the campaigns prior to wednesday s cnbc debate some campaigns ripped cnbc for suggesting there wouldn t be opening or closing statements if they didn t get them rand paul aide chris lacivita said on the call cnbc could go f themselves trump threatened to pull out of the contest and he even bragged during the debate that he extracted concessions from the network to keep the debate to two hours and reinsert opening and closing statements lower tier candidates complained that the rnc intentionally had embarrassed them by requiring them to debate in front of an empty arena while the top tier candidates got a full house the rnc has stopped holding those calls now in large part because of frustration over the rampant leaks to the press by participants during a pre debate meeting with campaigns on tuesday in boulder spicer vented about private conference calls going public but the rnc insists its debate plans are still working the meeting of the campaigns on sunday committee officials say is just a chance for them to reach consensus on demands for future debates a list they ll submit to the rnc which will in turn advocate for its candidates there are unarguably fewer debates rnc officials note and they ve been scheduled far enough in advance that candidates can plan for them conservative commentators such as radio host hugh hewitt and cnbc s larry kudlow have been included on the moderating panels wednesday s cnbc gop debate induced unusually high criticism ap photo rnc allies aren t convinced the campaigns will be able to come to consensus on how to proceed bottom of the pile candidates like jindal want networks to factor in early state polls to determine who participates in primetime contents similarly back of the pack republicans say that rather than tiering the debates based on volatile national poll numbers candidates should be divided evenly based on a random drawing front running candidates like donald trump and ben carson are unlikely to agree to either term none of this drama was supposed to happen after 2012 an rnc panel concluded that mitt romney s loss was at least partly attributable to a primary season packed with 20 debates many long after romney appeared to have a lock on the nomination the number of debates has become ridiculous and they re taking candidates away from other important campaign activities an rnc autopsy concluded after the 2012 loss that year candidates were often invited to debate just a couple weeks in advance forcing them to disrupt their schedules and the lack of sanctioned debates led to dozens of invitations that each campaign had to assess and vet themselves that won t be the case this year the changes we ve made are massive improvements duprey said at a briefing for reporters in early october rnc officials emphasized that while they could influence the number of debates and the general calendar they couldn t control the tenor among the candidates and what questions moderators ask duprey said the rnc has also learned a few lessons from some of its early foibles this year most notably he said it s likely they d agree next cycle to give all prominent candidates even those barely registering in polls a chance to appear on equal footing with front runners for the first nationally televised debate duprey also said he d favor factoring in early state polls to ensure that candidates focused on winning those states have a chance to compete and three hours is too long for a debate he said a reference to a september cnn debate some of the campaigns are frustrated he acknowledged but there s only so much the rnc can influence he said and the moderators performance is not among them once the lights go on and they go live just like the academy awards you never know what they re going to say he said alex isenstadt ben schreckinger and glenn thrush contributed missing out on
