watch cbsn live june 3 2019 9 05 am cbs ap beijing china fired back at the u s sunday over the two nations trade dispute issuing a report that blamed the conflict on the trump administration but refrained from escalating the trade war the report from the cabinet spokesman s office said china won t back down on major issues of principle but it offered no sense of whether or how the world s second largest economy might retaliate against u s tariffs on goods manufactured in china and exported to the u s the report said china has kept its word throughout 11 rounds of talks and will honor its commitments if a trade agreement is reached it accused the u s of backtracking three times over the course of the talks by introducing new tariffs and other conditions beyond what was agreed on but the more the u s government is offered the more it wants it said america s negotiators were resorting to intimidation and coercion according to the report a country s sovereignty and dignity must be respected and any agreement reached by the two sides must be based on equality and mutual benefit the report delivered at a sunday morning news conference appears to be a bid to shore up china s arguments and justify its position in the face of what looks to be a protracted dispute over recent days china has been mobilizing its representatives abroad to sell its position with foreign audiences while the domestic propaganda apparatus has been working overtime to convince the public of the righteousness of the government s stance linda lim a professor at ross school of business at the university of michigan said the report doesn t represent an escalation on china s part but rather reiterates the government s position in a clear and measured way that leaves the door open for negotiations they threw the ball back into the u s court she said she added that the report is a public relations win for china s government at a time when u s president donald trump s trade policy is antagonizing other u s trading partners most recently mexico mr trump announced last week that he would impose 5 tariffs on mexican imports starting june 10 if the mexicans don t do more to stop the surge of central american migrants across the southern u s border height securities said in a monday note that we view this white paper not as a signal that china is taking a more cooperative tone but rather as confirmation that china is unwilling to make the type of major unilateral concession demanded by the trump administration the u s has accused china of stealing trade secrets and forcing technology transfers the trump administration has imposed 25 tariffs on 250 billion in chinese imports and is planning to tax the 300 billion in imports that have so far been spared it also escalated the stakes this month by putting chinese telecom giant huawei on a blacklist that effectively bars u s companies from supplying it with computer chips software and other components without government approval beijing responded by imposing tariffs on 60 billion worth of u s products which went into effect saturday it also retaliated against the u s blacklisting of huawei by announcing friday that it will establish its own list of unreliable entities consisting of foreign businesses corporations and individuals wang shouwen china s vice commerce minister and deputy international trade representative said china would issue more detailed information on the unreliable entities list soon but that it was aimed at enterprises that violated market principles and cut supplies of components to chinese businesses for noncommercial reasons china s statement that it intends to publish such a list follows additional measures last week that deepened the bite of u s sanctions imposed on huawei in mid may several leading u s based global technology standards setting groups announced restrictions on huawei s participation in their activities under u s commerce department rules that bar the sale and transfer of u s technology to huawei without government approval given the upcoming unreliable list and the announced investigation of fedex there may be concerns among foreign companies in china about such scrutiny goldman sachs said in a report monday morning it noted that american companies aren t the only targets since third country companies could become involved as well when they have relationships with companies in either the us or china goldman noted that given the risk that investment sentiment could be affected by such concerns we would expect the chinese government to act cautiously wang also repeated suggestions that china could restrict the export of exotic minerals known as rare earths that are widely used in electric cars and cellphones foremost among them is lithium the main component in modern batteries the threat to use china s rich supply of rare earths as leverage in the conflict has contributed to sharp losses in u s stocks and sliding long term bond yields if some countries use china s rare earth metals to produce products to contain china s development this is unacceptable by standards of both minds and hearts wang said sunday s report lays out china s argument for blaming washington for the frictions as well as the costs to both sides it said china has room for fiscal policy changes to maintain the health of its economy amid the dispute wang said china had been forced to take forceful measures in response to u s actions and denied china had backtracked on its earlier commitments he said the u s had made unacceptable demands including on tariffs and compulsory requirements that infringed on chinese sovereignty you give them an inch they take a yard he said mr trump has touted the tariff increases as a way of reducing china s trade surplus with the u s which hit a staggering 379 billion last year however wang questioned how much china was actually benefiting from its surplus saying a joint chinese u s study showed the u s figure could be inflated by as much as 20 he also said many of those exports were produced by foreign companies operating in china and that chinese firms often pocketed only a relatively meager fee for assembling subtracting the u s surplus in services trade with china the actual surplus came to just 152 6 billion last year wang said the u s deficit with china has actually been worsening since tariffs were first imposed wang said pointing to a 50 decline in soybean exports to china and a drop off in u s auto sales in the country the average u s family meanwhile will pay an additional 831 for consumer items over the year due to the higher tariffs he said while the dispute s impact on businesses could end up costing 2 23 million u s jobs overall said wang that shows that the deepening trade restrictions hurt u s workers first published on june 3 2019 9 05 am 2019 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed the
