advertisement supported by by the new york times right now doug jones is projected to win the alabama senate race according to the associated press see full results here here is our coverage of election day before the results came in the results of a special senate election in alabama on tuesday will carry immense national implications for president trump and both parties after a strange and ugly campaign left voters exhausted by the politicking and confused at the polls a victory by the republican candidate roy s moore who has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls would illustrate the enduring limitations of democrats in the deeply conservative south a win by his democratic rival doug jones to fill the seat left vacant when the president appointed jeff sessions as attorney general would shrink republicans senate advantage to a single seat putting their majority in play mr trump who ultimately gave mr moore his full throated endorsement tweeted his support on tuesday morning roy moore will always vote with us mr jones who cast his ballot early will need strong turnout from black urban and suburban white voters mr moore who rode his horse to the polls will need support from rural white voters read how mr moore s sexual misconduct scandal unfolded follow our reporters on the ground on twitter jess bidgood alan blinder alexander burns richard fausset and jonathan martin sign up for the morning briefing for politics news and a daily look at what you need to know to begin your day for republicans it did not have to come to this writes alexander burns one of our political reporters mr moore was never inevitable read more in our outline of the decisions that republican leaders made to bring things to this point as voters went to the polls two officials with civil rights groups detailed reported polling problems at a news conference on tuesday evening include long lines twitter users posting misleading election information and confusion over an option on the ballot allowing a straight ticket vote in some localities kristen clarke the president of the lawyers committee for civil rights under law said voting rights advocates were still investigating the reported failure of some alabamians to receive absentee ballots they had requested but neither of the officials said that there had been any systematic effort to disrupt or sway the election benard simelton the president of the alabama state conference of the n a a c p said he believed some of the problems could have stemmed from turnout issues ms clarke cited long lines and large numbers of voters reported in birmingham but was not specific on the sources of the reports some people told hotline workers that the state had designated them inactive voters and required them to recertify their eligibility which mr simleton said could signal that voters who had sat out past elections were casting ballots in this one some of those voters ms clarke said were wrongly told that they were ineligible to vote or could only cast provisional ballots in an earlier interview john h merrill the alabama secretary of state said the people who reported having been designated as inactive were eligible to vote but had been placed on a list of inactive voters after they failed to cast ballots in several elections he said they could update their personal information at their polling place it s not even a hiccup said mr merrill a republican it takes less than three minutes for them to update their information mr moore emerged from a stand of woods tuesday astride sassy his tennessee walking horse about 40 minutes behind schedule he was wearing a black hat and a grin and keen to vote gathered for the event at the gallant volunteer fire department headquarters journalists and camera operators had expected mr moore to come riding along the road in gallant ala but when he and his wife kayla instead trotted out of a stand of trees there was an inelegant scramble for the better angle mr moore tied sassy to a fence and made his way up to the polling place he was asked what he would say to his accusers i d say tell the truth he replied eventually mr moore disappeared into the little building then emerged with an i voted sticker reporters asked what his message would be for senator mitch mcconnell the majority leader if he were to win well i m coming to the senate and we ll work out our problems there he said wearing a broad smile and pronouncing himself exuberant mr jones cast a ballot for himself on tuesday morning and leveled a final round of criticism at his republican opponent accompanied by his wife louise and his sons mr jones strolled into the brookwood baptist church in mountain brook an upscale birmingham suburb picking up his ballot from a line of tables backed by a cross and a christmas tree alluding to the state s restrictive voter identification law he joked to his wife louise got your id mr jones predicted black turnout would be strong and laced into mr moore for comments he has made criticizing the constitutional amendments enacted after the civil war that abolished slavery and gave broader rights to african americans i think they ve seen within doug jones a partner for a long time mr jones said of the black community and they sure don t see a partner in roy moore it was 9 a m tuesday and brandy weston 34 and her husband greg weston 45 had already gotten their voting out of the way and were busy loading boxes of fruit onto the back of their pickup outside of their produce stand in ashville a little town a few miles from mr moore s polling place both voted for mr moore ms weston said she generally disagreed with mr jones s politics and said she was disappointed that mr jones used the allegations to attack mr moore i don t know she said honestly i even debated about going to vote this morning but she did and she made her choice on the theory that if the allegations were somehow proved alabama s republican governor could put another less controversial republican in the senate seat for the time being i m tired of hearing about it ms weston said whatever it s going to be it s going to be you know but one woman after another said the allegations against mr moore bothered them at a busy polling station in ozark in southeast alabama leslie mcleod 27 said she cast her ballot for democrat doug a reference to mr jones the other one is a rapist and he said all the times were good was when there was slavery she said recalling mr moore s remarks that the nation was last great in the era of slavery mr moore insists that he did not molest teenage girls or make romantic advances toward them when he was an adult he has not been charged with any crimes related to the misconduct allegations tanya embry 36 also cited deep concerns about mr moore s behavior i know this is typically a republican state but i can t get behind somebody who is being accused of things like what he s being accused of she said predicting which voters will cast ballots is difficult ahead of any special election writes nate cohn the upshot s election analyst modeling alabama s electorate this year is even harder because there is no comparable past election featuring motivated democrats and an unpopular republican nominee in a deeply red state william nathan mathis a 74 year old peanut farmer called on fellow alabamians to reject mr moore s condemnation of same sex relationships mr mathis held a hand lettered placard and a photo of his late daughter patti sue who was gay and committed suicide in 1995 asked tuesday afternoon if mr moore thinks that homosexual conduct should be illegal ted crockett a campaign spokesman told cnn probably when mr moore s campaign held its final rally in midland city late monday it was ms moore the candidate s wife who grabbed the headlines with her attempt to inoculate her husband from charges of bigotry that have dogged him but her comments likely raised more eyebrows than praises fake news would also have you think that my husband doesn t support the black community yet my husband appointed the very first black marshal to the alabama supreme court mr willie james when he first took office as chief justice many years ago he brought with him three people from etowah county two were black and one of them is here tonight we have many friends that are black and we also fellowship with them in church and in our home fake news would tell you that we don t care for jews i tell you all this because i ve seen it all so i just want to set the record straight while they re here one of our attorneys is a jew we have very close friends that are jewish and rabbis and we also fellowship with them read more on the story here african american turnout typically falls in nonpresidential election years and voting rights advocates say that alabama s voter id law and partisan administration of voting rules have the potential to suppress the black vote but if black alabamians make up more than 25 percent of voters on tuesday mr jones will have a strong chance to score an upset many of them live in cities like birmingham and montgomery in addition several largely poor counties that are predominantly african american like dallas lowndes marengo and perry stretch across the middle of the state it is hard to overstate the disdain many voters in alabama s cities and suburbs harbor toward mr moore yet it is not enough for mr jones to just win over those college educated voters who most loathe mr moore the democrat also has to persuade republicans who are more ambivalent about the race if mr jones is to have a chance at winning he must run up the margin against mr moore in jefferson county which includes birmingham and is the state s most populous and convincingly win the state s next largest counties mobile and madison which are also filled with educated and affluent voters if energizing african americans is key for mr jones it is equally crucial for mr moore to get a strong turnout from his longtime base of rural white voters if these voters decide to stay home because of the sexual misconduct accusations these conservatives are highly unlikely to cross party lines it would greatly complicate the republican s electoral math these small population counties stretching across the state s northern tier and just above the gulf coast are likely to report early mr moore s margins in them will go a long way toward indicating whether he can withstand mr jones s expected success reported later in the night in alabama s cities if mr moore is hitting the sort of marks he reached in his republican runoff victory in september over 60 percent in a number of rural counties he will most likely claim victory it is quite difficult for an alabama democrat to capture over 50 percent of the vote but mr jones may not have to capture a majority to win tuesday senator richard c shelby a republican and the state s longest serving lawmaker used a national television interview sunday to remind alabamians that he had written in the name of another republican rather than supporting mr moore his example could spur others in the party to do the same and there are two ready options lee busby a republican and a retired marine colonel from tuscaloosa has announced a write in bid and a number of votes will almost certainly go to someone widely considered the most important man in the state the university of alabama football coach nick saban the more republicans or independents who write in the name of a third candidate the lower the threshold mr jones needs to reach depending on the number of write ins he could potentially win even if he only captures 48 percent of the vote advertisement
