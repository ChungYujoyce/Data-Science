here s how we analyzed in real time the republican nevada caucuses updated 9 56 p m senator ted cruz s presidential campaign erupted in turmoil on monday as mr cruz fired his chief spokesman for spreading a misleading video of senator marco rubio an ill timed shake up for a campaign already under duress on the eve of the republican caucuses in nevada for mr cruz who has vigorously defended himself in recent weeks as rivals accused him of running an underhanded race the episode cuts at the premise of his bid he has cast himself as the candidate of honesty and integrity with a faith based pitch and a backdrop that reads trusted during speeches on monday amid persistent sniping from mr rubio and donald j trump about the cruz campaign s penchant to mislead the texas senator was at last forced to acknowledge his team had gone too far at issue was a video of a hotel lobby encounter between mr rubio and a cruz staff member who had a bible with him the video s subtitles suggested mr rubio had said there were not many answers in the bible mr cruz s communications director rick tyler posted the video on facebook and twitter on sunday needling mr rubio for an awkward remark in fact mr rubio had said the bible had all the answers mr cruz said monday that he had spent the morning investigating the episode i have made clear in this campaign that we will conduct this campaign with the very highest standards of integrity he told reporters during a news conference in las vegas describing his decision to request mr tyler s resignation he called mr tyler a good man but said that his sharing of the video was a grave error in judgment even if it was true we are not a campaign that is going to question the faith of another candidate mr cruz said even if it was true our campaign should not have sent it mr cruz took no questions about mr tyler before making a hasty exit the campaign s self inflicted drama came as mr cruz and mr rubio who edged past him in south carolina strained to emerge as the chief challenger to mr trump the two are also tussling over evangelical support which is particularly essential to mr cruz making the dust up over a remark about the bible especially tense but mr tyler s dismissal and mr cruz s acknowledgment of a campaign misstep were a clear boon to mr rubio on another front creating the kind of cudgel that could prove powerful at a crucial stage of the race it represents a public admission of what mr rubio and mr trump have angrily asserted for weeks that mr cruz has employed deceitful tactics to undermine his rivals including a photograph doctored by his aides that suggested mr rubio was shaking hands with president obama in front of the capitol in washington after mr tyler s dismissal mr rubio s team moved quickly to focus attention on his boss rick is a really good spokesman who had the unenviable task of working for a candidate willing to do or say anything to get elected said mr rubio s spokesman alex conant there is a culture in the cruz campaign from top to bottom that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty rick did the right thing by apologizing to marco it s high time for ted cruz to do the right thing and stop the lies mr trump has less credibly attacked mr cruz on similar grounds threatening a defamation suit over an ad reminding voters of his past support for abortion rights he was likewise eager to seize on monday s news wow ted cruz falsely suggested marco rubio mocked the bible and was just forced to fire his communications director mr trump wrote on twitter more dirty tricks privately mr cruz s advisers have acknowledged that perceptions about his integrity had taken a toll since his victory in iowa on caucus night his team spread word to voters with a liberal interpretation of a cnn report that ben carson planned to suspend his campaign the mild mannered mr carson widely admired even by non supporters seethed with anger and much of the republican field came to his defense days earlier mr cruz had earned a rebuke from iowa s secretary of state for mailers that accused residents of nonexistent voter violations as the race reached south carolina mr rubio s team assailed mr cruz and his allies for myriad alleged mistruths after a legal review some television stations in south carolina pulled an ad from a pro cruz super pac that had criticized mr rubio s record on immigration mr cruz also faced criticism from national right to life for what it called inaccurate and misleading remarks about mr rubio s record on abortion there have been lesser unforced errors as when mr cruz pulled one of his campaign ads after learning that an actress in it had a prior career in soft core pornography mr cruz once one of the most broadly popular candidates in the field has seen his favorability ratings slip as the race has taken a sharply negative turn a monmouth university poll of south carolina republicans showed mr cruz with a 45 percent favorability rating and a 39 percent unfavorable rating a steep fall from november figures of 52 and 21 the latest episode is unlikely to help even as mr cruz s team made clear it was moving on shortly after the announcement the campaign circulated a memo arguing mr cruz is the only candidate who can defeat donald trump bob vander plaats an iowa evangelical activist and national co chairman for mr cruz said the senator was determined to show his campaign operated at the highest level of integrity after weeks of accusations from rivals mr vander plaats said he believed mr tyler s misstep would not have been a major controversy if not for recent history at another time it s probably not a big deal but this time it s a big deal mr vander plaats said adding i love rick but it s something that probably had to be done after posting the video about mr rubio and the bible on sunday morning mr tyler apologized late that night i would not knowingly post a false story he wrote on facebook adding that the initial article from the university of pennsylvania s student newspaper the daily pennsylvanian had misquoted mr rubio in its video but the fact remains that i did post it when i should have checked its accuracy first i regret the mistake earlier on monday mr rubio said he had accepted mr tyler s apology but raised questions about the accountability of the cruz campaign mr tyler had been scheduled to be interviewed on msnbc moments before mr cruz began his news conference about the move the cable network said mr tyler left abruptly just before his planned appearance kate snow the news anchor wrote in an email to colleagues calls to mr tyler were not returned though mr tyler a former top aide to newt gingrich was not a longtime member of mr cruz s orbit like some other advisers he was one of the earliest hires for the campaign and was known for his colorful quotes and aggressive attacks on rivals he attained a level of cult status in 2011 for a creative news release in praise of mr gingrich which was later the subject of a dramatic reading by john lithgow on the colbert report the literati sent out their minions to do their bidding it began before a flourish on the billowing smoke and dust of tweets and trivia from which mr gingrich had emerged unscathed but in this campaign mr tyler had a tendency at times to get ahead of mr cruz when sarah palin was expected to endorse mr trump last month mr tyler said the move would damage her and her reputation as a conservative champion mr cruz later said he would not have been a senator without her help until now though mr cruz had vigorously defended his team instead accusing journalists or rival campaigns of seeking to generate controversy at his expense on monday mr cruz did not entirely abandon the instinct to hit back suggesting that mr rubio was seeking to deflect attention from his record they have a long record they ve earned in south carolina for engaging in this kind of trickery of impugning the integrity of whoever their opponent is to distract attention mr cruz said we are going to remain focused on issues reporting was contributed by maggie haberman jeremy w peters jonathan martin alexander burns and
