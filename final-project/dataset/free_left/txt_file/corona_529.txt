advertisement supported by most districts have no plans to end online lessons soon and reopening will bring significant changes educators say by shawn hubler erica l green and dana goldstein sacramento with students languishing the economy stagnating and working parents straining to turn their kitchen tables into classrooms the nation s public schools have been working to bring children back to their desks lockers and study halls but despite president trump s prediction that i think you ll see a lot of schools open up all but a few states have suspended in person classes for the rest of the academic year and some are preparing for the possibility of shutdowns or part time schedules in the fall gov gavin newsom of california raised the idea on tuesday that the next academic year could start as soon as july to make up for the abbreviated spring term but he cautioned that if we pull back too quickly a fresh wave of the coronavirus could erupt illinois officials have gone even further warning that remote learning could continue indefinitely this may be the new normal even in the fall said janice jackson the chief executive of chicago public schools gov philip d murphy of new jersey who like mr newsom has school age children at home is one of the few state leaders who has left open the prospect of schools reopening this spring if several benchmarks are first met whenever students do come back classes are unlikely to look anything like the school days they remember there may be staggered half day classes or one day on one day off schedules so desks can be spread out and buses can run half empty students can expect school equipment to be sterilized and meals to be served at their desks or in socially distanced lunchrooms masked teachers and temperature checks at school doorways may be common forget note passing study groups and recess and if new outbreaks surface virtual classes may abruptly start up again a few small remote districts might try to reopen this spring including the shoshone school district in lincoln county idaho which serves 500 students we re in the category of we don t know said rob waite the superintendent with small class sizes the largest is 22 students children could easily sit six feet apart and on the bus students who are not part of the same household could be assigned to sit in every other seat the no 1 most important question we re trying to ask is is anything we re doing putting our students in danger mr waite said officials are also aware that the economy cannot function normally until children have places to safely spend the day while their parents work mr trump s nudge on monday which came during a conversation with governors occurred as oil prices slid and desperate small businesses crashed a federal website processing loan applications in georgia where gov brian kemp has aggressively pushed to revive the economy officials said that a return to school would be an essential part of restoring a semblance of normalcy i think it s going to be a cornerstone said matt jones the chief of staff for the georgia department of education there are certain elements of our society that are part of the fabric of who we are and public education and schooling is just one of those things but mr kemp has joined most governors in canceling in person education through the academic year which ends for most of georgia s public schools in mid may mr jones said some districts were considering a restart of classes at least in some limited form in july for summer remedial programs others are hoping to return to normal in the fall districts are also feeling the economic impact of the pandemic anticipating huge budget shortfalls and teachers are eager to return to the classroom saying they miss the energy of real world interaction with students then there are the educational concerns to make up for lost classroom time schools may need to provide remedial instruction additional special education services and counseling said robin lake director of the center on reinventing public education policy experts are also debating whether students who lag behind in key skills should be held back a grade or advanced with extra catch up support mayor bill de blasio of new york city who announced this month that the city s 1 1 million students would not return to classrooms until september has said that many children will have to make up for months of lost learning despite the city s shift to remote instruction but there is also a pervasive fear about what it would mean to bring students and teachers back together too quickly given all that is unknown about how the virus spreads forcing educators to work at a perceived risk to their own health could be not only a public health danger but also a recipe for labor unrest in a heavily unionized sector janet robinson superintendent of stratford public schools in connecticut said she was horrified to hear the president urging schools to open students in her district were among the first children in the state to test positive her staff including teachers who are cancer survivors are worried about being rushed back into the classroom i saw the president say the kids don t get sick ms robinson said well they re not in there all by themselves and i d hate for a little kid to come into the building get the virus and take it home then we d start this thing all over again in nations that have begun to reopen schools like denmark classes and other activities are being held partially outdoors in china where the pandemic began students have returned not only to masks but also to glass desk dividers teachers in protective suits and lunch tables that keep them a meter apart and at which talking is forbidden at one school basketballs were being disinfected individually some public health experts have suggested that younger children could be brought back before teenagers who appear to be more susceptible to infection and are also more able to learn independently from home yet in parts of germany it has been older students who were welcomed back first in part to take final exams from widely spaced desks those other countries have made faster strides than the united states in testing and contact tracing however raising questions about whether it is wise for american schools to forge ahead before the health system significantly advances its ability to combat the virus in los angeles where the nation s second largest public school system serves some 700 000 students the superintendent austin beutner on monday said robust testing and tracing would have to be a prerequisite to reopening we closed school facilities on march 13 so our schools did not become a petri dish and cause the virus to spread in the communities we serve mr beutner said that s worked we do not want to reverse that in a hasty return to schools updated may 20 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities lack of testing has remained an issue for states despite white house pledges to expand it and the federal government has issued mixed guidance for districts since the outset of the pandemic offering varying takes on the effectiveness of school closures in mr trump s three phase reopening plan the federal government recommended that schools reopen in phase 2 in which states were urged to limit gatherings to 50 people when social distancing was not possible educators balked noting that schools typically house hundreds of staff members and students in the same breath that the guidance highlights a path forward in opening schools it establishes a scenario where every single school would be in direct conflict with another recommendation daniel a domenech executive director of a national association of school superintendents said in a statement in most of the country superintendents are still basing their plans on guidance from local and state health officials more than 40 states have suspended in person classes for the rest of the academic year and districts are still focused on remote learning virtual graduations and planning for summer and fall melonie hau the superintendent of newcastle public schools in oklahoma said she had worried after seeing a handful of secretaries allowed to work a few hours a week in the central office gather around a desk to catch up on how their families were coping i m concerned about bringing anyone back together in a building ms hau said there s just cultural things that come with being in the same room together and to show appreciation for one another that makes social distancing so hard in schools like many superintendents ms hau has been weighing what reopening will look like including suggestions of alternating the days that students attend it s hard to imagine a schedule where you could make it work just halfway she said in my mind we re all in or we re all out shawn
