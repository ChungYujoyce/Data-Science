loans meant to keep small businesses afloat and paying their employees during the covid 19 crisis following requests from senator elizabeth warren and other lawmakers for it to do so i want to assure you my office will perform our work to the highest standards to promote transparency of this vital stimulus program and make recommendations for corrective action to ensure the funds are used efficiently effectively and in accordance with the law sba inspector general hannibal mike ware wrote in a letter to warren and representative nydia velazquez cbs news campaign reporter zak hudaksays the lawmakers had written to ware a week earlier asking that his office review whether the sba and treasury department had ensured lenders and small businesses could access paycheck protection program loans quickly and equitably and that it minimized waste fraud and abuse they also called for an investigation into whether banks played favorites with wealthier customers and whether companies with political connections received priority access to loans ware noted that his office had been proactive in releasing fraud schemes related to ppp and had been the first to commission reports on waste fraud and abuse in covid 19 funding he said his office plans to release a flash report on ppp implementation at the request of several other senators by may 8 and another on the the loan forgiveness piece of the program ware also said they planned to investigate the questions posed by the lawmakers it is unlikely that a single review will cover all three aspects sought in your request however we believe our planned work to include the flash reports will provide the transparency necessary to inform the concerns noted relative to lending practices of the banks in implementing ppe he wrote
