advertisement supported by by giovanni russonello good morning and welcome to on politics a daily political analysis of the 2020 elections based on reporting by new york times journalists first some good news on the coronavirus treatment front the drug maker moderna announced yesterday that it had reached a milestone in the hunt for a virus vaccine after an initial round of testing the first vaccine to be tried in human subjects appeared to be safe and to stimulate an immune response against the virus the nation s top health officials have warned over and over that a coronavirus vaccine will not arrive quickly even an accelerated search would probably last into 2021 so far moderna has run successful tests on just eight people all of them between the ages of 18 and 55 and the results don t yet prove that this vaccine can prevent people from getting sick still yesterday s news sent stocks soaring with wall street experiencing its best day in roughly six weeks the s p 500 rose by more than 3 percent and stock benchmarks in europe were 4 to 6 percent higher and now some slightly more outlandish news on the coronavirus treatment front president trump said yesterday that he had been taking hydroxychloroquine an antimalarial drug as a preventive measure against the virus even though its effectiveness as a treatment for covid 19 has not been proven and public health officials have warned that its risks probably outweigh any possible benefits late last month after trump and some conservative commentators began to push the drug as a virus treatment the food and drug administration released a public health advisory that warned against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for covid 19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial on monday trump who continues to test negative for the virus told reporters at the white house all i can tell you is so far i seem to be ok the drug poses a particular threat of side effects in people who have an elevated risk of heart disease in 2018 the white house physician reported that trump s ldl cholesterol level was 143 far higher than the ideal level of 100 or less until yesterday the big question hanging over the capitol was when the senate would pass the next stimulus bill now apparently there s a new one when will the stimulus funding that has already been passed even be used most of the 500 billion that congress allocated in march to support businesses and local governments has not yetbeen doled out according to a report released monday by the congressional commission overseeing that money the federal reserve and the treasury department are responsible for distributing it in the form of loans jerome powell the fed chair and steven mnuchin the treasury secretary will testify today before the senate banking committee where they ll probably be met with pointed questions about what s causing the holdup when it comes to helping main street businesses we should err on the side of doing a little too much rather than doing too little said senator mark warner a democrat who sits on the banking committee california has introduced a first of its kind program offering relief checks to undocumented immigrants who were denied federal assistance under the march stimulus package the 75 million initiative will send 500 checks to individuals or 1 000 payments to households and it has the capacity to serve roughly 150 000 recipients according to state officials the funds will be awarded on a first come first served basis with requests vetted by 12 nonprofit organizations designated by the state the program proved immediately popular an hour after phone lines had opened for inquiries yesterday morning many of them had crashed by 90 minutes in 630 000 calls had been made to just one of the 12 nonprofits the coalition for humane immigrant rights of los angeles we knew the number of applicants would be high but we were just overwhelmed said angelica salas the group s executive director president trump made his hydroxychloroquine reveal at a round table with restaurant executives at the white house on monday by kathy gray michigan became the latest state to begin to ease restrictions on strict stay at home orders that kept thousands of businesses closed and residents stuck inside their homes as it happens nearly all of the counties where businesses will be allowed to reopen this week trend republican an example of how americans experiences of the coronavirus often differ along political lines gretchen whitmer the state s democratic governor announced yesterday that restaurants bars and retail shops in certain northern counties could begin reopening on friday in time for the memorial day weekend most establishments have been shuttered since whitmer issued a stay at home order on march 23 the resort towns along the great lakes beaches have experienced only 1 percent of the state s 51 915 confirmed coronavirus cases and a similarly small share of its 4 915 virus related deaths keep your wits about you whitmer said in announcing the decision let s not all go rushing out and force a closure eventually what we want to do is keep moving forward the announcement came on the same day that more than 130 000 autoworkers across the united states returned to work including many in michigan and it presented a stark example of the cultural and geographic divides that persist in michigan particularly with regard to the pandemic the areas that are reopening are primarily rural while the urban and suburban centers that have been particularly hard hit by the virus will continue to be locked down until at least may 28 the political divide is just as glaring all but one of the 32 counties that are now reopening voted for trump in the 2016 presidential election and only three of them supported whitmer for governor in 2018 whitmer has been blasted by trump and other republicans and in recent weeks she has been the target of protests calling for an end to government mandated social distancing republicans in the legislature are suing her over the stay at home order those legislative leaders said her action yesterday was too little too late this is a positive step that we ve been requesting for over a month now but the vast majority of michigan is still held captive in the nation s worst lockdown lee chatfield who is the speaker of the republican held state house and represents a district in northern michigan wrote on twitter despite three raucous rallies recently in lansing where some people carried military style rifles and confederate battle flags whitmer s approval ratings have jumped during the coronavirus crisis sixty three percent of michigan voters said they approved of her job performance according to a fox news
