advertisement supported by a series of missed chances by the federal government to ensure more widespread testing came during the early days of the outbreak when containment would have been easier by sheri fink and mike baker dr helen y chu an infectious disease expert in seattle knew that the united states did not have much time in late january the first confirmed american case of the coronavirus had landed in her area critical questions needed answers had the man infected anyone else was the deadly virus already lurking in other communities and spreading as luck would have it dr chu had a way to monitor the region for months as part of a research project into the flu she and a team of researchers had been collecting nasal swabs from residents experiencing symptoms throughout the puget sound region to repurpose the tests for monitoring the coronavirus they would need the support of state and federal officials but nearly everywhere dr chu turned officials repeatedly rejected the idea interviews and emails show even as weeks crawled by and outbreaks emerged in countries outside of china where the infection began by feb 25 dr chu and her colleagues could not bear to wait any longer they began performing coronavirus tests without government approval what came back confirmed their worst fear they quickly had a positive test from a local teenager with no recent travel history the coronavirus had already established itself on american soil without anybody realizing it it must have been here this entire time dr chu recalled thinking with dread it s just everywhere already in fact officials would later discover through testing the virus had already contributed to the deaths of two people and it would go on to kill 20 more in the seattle region over the following days federal and state officials said the flu study could not be repurposed because it did not have explicit permission from research subjects the labs were also not certified for clinical work while acknowledging the ethical questions dr chu and others argued there should be more flexibility in an emergency during which so many lives could be lost on monday night state regulators told them to stop testing altogether the failure to tap into the flu study detailed here for the first time was just one in a series of missed chances by the federal government to ensure more widespread testing during the early days of the outbreak when containment would have been easier instead local officials across the country were left to work in the dark as the crisis grew undetected and exponentially even now after weeks of mounting frustration toward federal agencies over flawed test kits and burdensome rules states with growing cases such as new york and california are struggling to test widely for the coronavirus the continued delays have made it impossible for officials to get a true picture of the scale of the growing outbreak which has now spread to at least 36 states and washington d c dr robert r redfield director of the centers for disease control and prevention said in an interview on friday that acting quickly was critical for combating an outbreak time matters he said he insisted that despite the rocky start there was still time to beat back the coronavirus in the united states it s going to take rigorous aggressive public health what i like to say block and tackle block and tackle block and tackle block and tackle he said that means if you find a new case you isolate it but the seattle flu study illustrates how existing regulations and red tape sometimes designed to protect privacy and health have impeded the rapid rollout of testing nationally while other countries ramped up much earlier and faster faced with a public health emergency on a scale potentially not seen in a century the united states has not responded nimbly the c d c s own effort to create a system for monitoring the virus around the country using established government surveillance networks for the flu has not yet built steam and as late as last week after expanding authorizations for commercial and academic institutions to make tests administration officials provided conflicting accounts of when a significant increase in tests would be available in states like maine missouri and michigan where there are few or no known infections state public health officials say they have more than enough tests to meet demand but it remains unclear how many americans have been tested for the coronavirus the c d c says approximately 8 500 specimens or nose swabs have been taken since the beginning of the outbreak a figure that is almost certainly larger than the number of people tested since one person can have multiple swabs by comparison south korea which discovered its first case around the same time as the united states has reported having the capacity to test roughly 10 000 people a day since late february transcript from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today it was supposed to be a relatively simple part of preparing for the coronavirus in the united states testing for it my colleague sheri fink on what went wrong it s wednesday march 11 so in 2018 it was the hundredth anniversary of the terrible 1918 flu pandemic this was called the spanish flu and it just killed millions and millions of people around the world so on that hundredth year anniversary many gatherings were held to discuss the lessons of that flu pandemic for today and there was this one gathering of high level people in atlanta georgia where the centers for disease control and prevention is based and among the officials there was a group from the national security council it had actually been created a special unit on global health security that was created after that terrible ebola outbreak in west africa so let s begin with you dr inaudible so one of the officials with that group with that unit well it s a pleasure to be here with so many of my colleagues and we ve been working together for more than a decade on these issues she steps up to the podium and she says the threat of pandemic flu is our number one health security concern we know that it cannot be stopped at the border so this is a pretty senior health official on the national security council warning her colleagues that there is a very predictable threat here a pandemic flu and are we ready to respond to a pandemic i fear the answer is no in her words the country is just not really ready for it so we should do something about it exactly and as it happens the very next day that global health security unit where she worked was shut down by a senior member of the trump administration so fast forward two years and it s early january january 3 it s a friday and the secretary of health and human services alex azar is at home in washington and he gets this phone call from robert redfield this doctor who s the head of the c d c and dr redfield tells azar about these reports coming out of china that there are these clusters of pneumonia cases and that the likely culprit is a new coronavirus and alex azar the health and human services secretary says this is a very big deal and what does azar do with this information and this understanding that whatever this is it s going to be a big deal the trump administration officials start meeting every day in the basement of the west wing and so at first they say ok let s screen the flights that are coming from china but there s an even more serious question that comes up which is should we ban flights altogether and should we deny entry to anybody who has come from china in the last 14 days to anybody who isn t a citizen or a permanent resident here so then that debate got shifted right to the oval office and the top health officials of the nation at that point were agreed a ban from traveling from the center of this epidemic could buy us some time could help us to prepare ourselves before this came it could slow that down the president asked what could the consequences be on the economy all logical things that you would probably ask in the end he sided with the aides who supported the idea that this could actually help protect our nation s health the problem was we weren t completely prepared our government wasn t completely prepared to use that time what do you mean the biggest issue that the government had to face was testing being able to diagnose somebody who has this illness and what is the problem with testing at this point well it didn t seem like there would be a problem even though it was a new virus the chinese quickly made the sequence of it available and labs were really quickly able to create a test for that including the world health organization had already approved a test that was developed by some german scientists but the u s which considers the c d c the world s premier public health agency they decided to make their own test but it didn t actually get f d a approved until the first week of february and at that point it could be distributed to public health laboratories across the country but you know now we re already over a month into this scary new outbreak by that point so this is already off to a pretty slow start at a moment where every single day counts that s right so now we re like a month into this thing and they re finally able to mail out the kits to public health laboratories around the country state health laboratories some big city health laboratories this network of labs that our public health system has and the next day the first step that the labs have to do is they have to check that test they have to what s called validate it make sure it s working and right that next day the c d c starts getting reports from some of these public health labs saying we re not able to validate this test we re having problems we re getting some inconclusive results and that s the first sign that something may have gone wrong this test is not working well the c d c says it was definitely working in their lab so they ve told all the labs across the country if it s not working for you of course don t use it just send samples to us of course that adds time you have to collect a sample in your local area and then send it to atlanta and then wait for that result to come back so what impact does this testing snafu have at this point on our understanding of the epidemic it just means that we don t know we actually don t know we say we have a low number of cases in this country at that point but if you don t test how can you know ok and for these weeks where it seemed like we had cases in the low double digits in the united states and there was a sense that things were quite stable and the danger was pretty low the virus very well could have been spreading and spreading widely and we wouldn t have known because we weren t doing the testing that would have told us that exactly and here s why because only a small proportion of people who get the virus get really really sick fortunately but by the time that they get into a critical care bed at a hospital and the doctors there are scratching their heads and they ve tested for all the known things that cause like pneumonia and severe severe respiratory distress weeks have gone by since that person was infected so you re actually looking at history if you finally get a positive test at that point then yes it has been spreading in the community and that s all that time that you lose right so this time that the trump administration had bought the american people with that dramatic step with shutting its border to chinese travelers is kind of being squandered yeah there were so many people who were starting to feel at this point like this time is being squandered and we needed to get eyes on this there were travelers coming from parts of the world where we didn t have a travel ban that now had a large number of cases and they weren t being screened at the airports they were going out into the communities and there was just this urgency of being able to test more and that s when this one group of doctors and researchers took matters into their own hands we ll be right back sheri who is this doctor so her name is helen chu hello this is helen hi helen how are you doing i m doing well how are you i m well thanks she s a physician and a researcher in washington state which is where the first case of coronavirus was detected in the u s back in january and she and her colleagues see a potential solution to this testing problem in their own work we had a study in place that was set up for detection of respiratory viral illnesses in the community she specializes in studying how viruses pass from person to person within that same community and she and her colleagues have this big study where they re collecting all these samples from people who are sick and then testing them in the lab for flu and other respiratory viruses and through collecting hundreds and hundreds of samples every week they re trying to track the spread of viruses and she was in the middle of collecting samples when the coronavirus arrives in washington that is right so we had this infrastructure in place already essentially in the seattle area to be able to detect early entry of a virus into the city and then to understand how it spread and that sounds like it would make her very well positioned to do the same thing for the coronavirus exactly she thought of that the state health officials knew about their project and they immediately thought about the potential of this project to help with this issue of testing and so what happens they make their own coronavirus test really fast and they re ready to go to help the state by the first week of february but there s one hitch we had to go through regulatory clearance essentially we had to talk to c d c we had to talk to f d a they don t have the approval to test and then give those results out for two reasons one is they re not a clinical lab so they don t have the regulatory approval for that and number two is they ve just created this new coronavirus test which isn t yet f d a approved and so we were at a point where we could test thousands and thousands of samples at very high throughput but we didn t know what to do when we found a positive so there s good reason to have some of those regulations in place but they figure this is a public health emergency and they feel like there s got to be some way around this bureaucratic red tape where they could at least screen these samples and get that information out to the public health authorities to confirm that test whatever it is but everybody felt very hesitant about us being able to provide results or to do the testing at all the c d c doesn t seem to find a way around it weeks go by and they re getting more and more frustrated and they re seeing the outbreak is growing in china and it s spreading to other countries so we know there s a potential for it to be an outbreak not just in china we had the information we had the data there sitting in our lab where we could actually answer the question and that was frustrating that we could answer it we had the capacity to answer it but we couldn t move forward because we didn t know what to do they feel like they re sitting on a gold mine and they feel like the virus very well could be out there after all there had been this case in washington state more than a month earlier and nobody s had eyes on it nobody s been doing surveillance in the community testing samples so they re getting more and more nervous is there something we re not seeing because we re not really testing very widely so what did they end up doing just kind of keeping those samples on ice and doing nothing well at first that s what they did because they thought they could speak with these officials and find out some official workaround so that they wouldn t be violating regulations and get in trouble everyone wanted to be able to do this the proper way to go through c d c and state labs and have them have the high capacity to do the testing of all of these patients who really needed a diagnosis but it just couldn t be done and then it gets to february 25 i mean the month is almost gone it s more than a month since that first case and they finally just said what we would do is move forward with research testing only we re going to start using this unapproved coronavirus test that we have and that we believe is very reliable and start testing these samples wow so they re just going for it well they re just going for it and technically they can test right but the issue is they can t report the results so what we would do would just be to go ahead and test the samples for coronavirus but not to associate that with the information from the sample so the clinical information so they have a plan to test for the coronavirus and if they find it that would mean that they re sitting on information that they re not supposed to have they re sitting on information that they re not supposed to communicate because of these regulatory issues it s all going to be fine as long as they don t find a case ok so once they decided to do that what happened what happened was one of the very first days that they started testing february 27 we got the first positive they found a case what i thought was oh no if it came up that early in our testing that meant that it had probably been here for a while and that we just didn t know that it was there and so the questions racing through my head at that point where what is the right thing to do right now and so what happened at that point was that we rapidly convened a meeting of the investigators the group just convenes they all get on the phone and they talk about ethics at this point we talked through the ethics of the different options keep it to ourselves tell public health or tell the participants and what we are allowed to do was to keep it to ourselves but what we felt like we needed to do was to tell public health and so that s what we did they decide that the most ethical thing is to report the result to the local health authority they confirmed the result and it s this local teenager in the very same county as that first positive case but no known link to that person and no travel history and that next morning the public health lab went out and they found this teenager who was feeling better by that point because he had had a mild form of this illness which is most common especially in young people and they get to him just after he walks into his school because he s oh wow yeah and they end up shutting the school down to make sure that nobody else will catch the virus i mean that was a good moment for our team i thought you know we did something that didn t follow the rules but we were able to prevent spread in a high school and that seemed really important so because of the doctor s actions they catch him basically in the nick of time they do and they also realize that they may have a big problem on their hands because if this case descended from that first case if that person potentially had infected somebody without knowing it and then there was mild illness going on and nobody caught it there could be hundreds of cases in the area and so that gave them the information that they needed to start acting to start looking more seriously for the virus in the community i wonder had dr chu not broken the rules in this case how that would have changed how we understand the coronavirus in the seattle region well we wouldn t have known until the people started dying that there was a problem and unfortunately the really sad thing is that that happened really soon after that and so if dr chu and her colleagues had been able to test sooner they would have been able to alert the authorities earlier and that s the real tragedy here sheri on the one hand the story that you have just told it s a pretty heroic story of a doctor willing to go against the rules the instructions because she felt that it was needed in the moment in the midst of a public health crisis on the other hand it feels risky for the lesson here to be that medical professionals should go rogue in the middle of a crisis i mean what in your mind is the lesson here i mean i m somebody who s reported on disasters for many years and used to do some disaster response myself and i ve always seen in crises that thinking outside the box can really solve problems and it can save lives and i think we generally accept that already that the rules do have to bend that people need to think creatively and one of the reasons they have to do it and it was so evident here was that the larger system the official responders the official system in place couldn t do everything and was faltering but i wonder how much would things potentially have been different sheri if thinking back to the start of our conversation those government programs the national security council s health program for example hadn t been cut i mean how much does that reflect an overall approach to this epidemic from the people currently in charge from the trump administration i think you can trace it back further than that it is a pattern that these programs when there s a crisis they get really well funded and as soon as ebola recedes into history we start cutting those parts of government you can look back after the anthrax attacks and 9 11 and there was all this money that went into bioterrorism preparedness and hospital preparedness and then you look at the numbers and they go down over time this is a reaction of humanity and society and government is to sort of like when it s in the news and it s fresh in our minds we invest in it and then we turn away so i feel like this is a pattern and when this happens and we have these gaps in our preparedness that the government always seems to have what i have found over and over again as a reporter is regular people step in and fill some of those holes and i m thinking right now i have this image of hurricane katrina and government officials not being able to rescue everybody who needed help all at once people waving towels off of rooftops and people stuck in hospitals and then it was these regular people who had airboats who were fishermen from western louisiana and they show up and they just take people to dry ground i ve seen examples like that over and over in this case we saw dr chu and her colleagues doing something like that but what i found out today on the phone with dr chu was that yesterday the washington state regulators called their lab and asked us to shut down the project got shut down again so the state regulators told them they can t keep doing this so it looks like the government isn t going to allow this to continue to fill that hole and so that hole remains the question is whether this will be one of those lessons that comes out of this particular outbreak and of course there will be a tomorrow there will be a day where we re not in the midst of something so frightening that we re in right now and the question is will this fit that same cycle where we say we ve learned the lesson we need to kind of innovate and come up with new systems that will ensure that we re on a better footing that we can have some backup system so that we can roll out testing as a country much more quickly or will this fit that same cycle where once the immediate danger goes away we stop investing or we just forget sheri thank you thank you a few days ago my colleague peter baker asked president trump whether he regrets eliminating the global health unit of the national security council in light of the coronavirus epidemic i just think this is something peter that you can never really think is going to happen i ve heard all about this could be a big deal from before it happened something like this could happen the president claimed despite past warnings from federal health officials that such an epidemic was previously unimaginable but who would have thought look how long ago was it six seven eight weeks ago who would have thought we d even be having this subject we were going to hit 30 000 on the dow like it was clockwork right we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today on tuesday public and private institutions across the united states took their strongest measures yet to limit the spread of the coronavirus dozens of colleges and universities from the university of california berkeley to harvard are closing their doors or asking students to attend classes remotely major airlines including delta and american airlines said they would drastically cut back on international flights and the nursing home industry issued a recommendation to bar visits from family and friends after deadly outbreaks inside of five nursing homes around seattle in new york officials have created a containment cell around the source of a major outbreak in the city of new rochelle north of new york city ordering schools community centers and houses of worship within the zone to close for the next two weeks and deploying the national guard inside the containment area and in california a cruise ship with at least 21 infected passengers docked in oakland where it was met by workers in protective gear who took those on board to a nearby military base in the largest quarantine operation so far on american soil for the results of tuesday night s democratic primaries which were held in six states listen to this morning s episode of the latest you can find it on the daily feed or by searching for the latest wherever you listen that s it for the daily i m michael barbaro see you tomorrow as soon as the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was published in january the c d c s first job was to develop a diagnostic test that s our prime mission dr redfield said to get eyes on this thing the agency also released criteria for deciding which individuals should be tested for the virus at first only those who had a fever and respiratory issues and had traveled from the outbreak s origin in wuhan china the criteria were so strict that the sick man in the seattle area who had visited wuhan did not meet it still worried state health officials pushed to get him checked and the c d c agreed local officials sent a sample to atlanta and the results came back positive officials monitored 70 people who were in contact with the man including 50 who consented to getting nose swabs and none tested positive for the coronavirus but there was still the possibility that someone had been missed said dr scott lindquist the state epidemiologist for communicable diseases around this time the washington state department of health began discussions with the seattle flu study already going on in the state but there was a hitch the flu project primarily used research laboratories not clinical ones and its coronavirus test was not approved by the food and drug administration and so the group was not certified to provide test results to anyone outside of their own investigators they began discussions with state c d c and f d a officials to figure out a solution according to emails and interviews dr scott f dowell a former high ranking c d c official and a current deputy director at the bill melinda gates foundation which funds the seattle flu study asked for help from the leaders of the c d c s coronavirus response hoping there is a solution he wrote on feb 10 later dr lindquist the state epidemiologist in washington wrote an email to dr alicia fry the chief of the c d c s epidemiology and prevention branch requesting the study be used to test for the coronavirus c d c officials repeatedly said it would not be possible if you want to use your test as a screening tool you would have to check with f d a gayle langley an officer at the c d c s national center for immunization and respiratory disease wrote back in an email on feb 16 but the f d a could not offer the approval because the lab was not certified as a clinical laboratory under regulations established by the centers for medicare medicaid services a process that could take months dr chu and dr lindquist tried repeatedly to wrangle approval to use the seattle flu study the answers were always no we felt like we were sitting waiting for the pandemic to emerge dr chu said we could help we couldn t do anything as washington state debated with the federal officials over what to do the c d c confronted the daunting task of testing more widely for the coronavirus the c d c had designed its own test as it typically does during an outbreak several other countries also developed their own tests but when the c d c shipped test kits to public labs across the country some local health officials began reporting that the test was producing invalid results the c d c promised that replacement kits would be distributed within days but the problem stretched on for over two weeks only five state laboratories were able to test in that period washington and new york were not among them by feb 24 as new cases of the virus began popping up in the united states the state labs were growing frantic the association of public health laboratories made what it called an extraordinary and rare request of dr stephen hahn the commissioner of the f d a asking him to use his discretion to allow state and local public health laboratories to create their own tests for the virus we are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of c d c for the vast majority of our member laboratories scott becker the chief executive of the association wrote in a letter to dr hahn dr hahn responded two days later saying in a letter that false diagnostic test results can lead to significant adverse public health consequences and that the laboratories were welcome to submit their own tests for emergency authorization but the approval process for laboratory developed tests was proving onerous private and university clinical laboratories which typically have the latitude to develop their own tests were frustrated about the speed of the f d a as they prepared applications for emergency approvals from the agency for their coronavirus tests updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities dr alex greninger an assistant professor at the university of washington medical center in seattle said he became exasperated in mid february as he communicated with the f d a over getting his application ready to begin testing this virus is faster than the f d a he said adding that at one point the agency required him to submit materials through the mail in addition to over email new tests typically require validation running the test on known positive samples from a patient or a copy of the virus genome the f d a s process called for five obtaining such samples has been hard because most hospital labs have not seen coronavirus cases yet said dr karen kaul chair of the department of pathology and laboratory medicine at northshore university healthsystem in illinois she said she had to scramble to obtain virus rna from a laboratory in europe everyone is trying to figure out what we can get to help us gather the data that we need she said the f d a has disputed that it moved too slowly saying that it provided emergency authorization for two laboratory developed tests within 24 hours of a completed submission one was the c d c s test and the other a test developed by new york s wadsworth laboratory after it had trouble verifying the c d c s test on the other side of the country in seattle dr chu and her flu study colleagues unwilling to wait any longer decided to begin running samples a technician in the laboratory of dr lea starita who was testing samples soon got a hit i m like oh my god dr starita said i just took off running to the office of the study s program managers we got one she told them what do we do members of the research group discussed the ethics of what to do next what we were allowed to do was to keep it to ourselves dr chu said but what we felt like we needed to do was to tell public health they decided the right thing to do was to inform local health officials the case was a teenager in the same county where the first coronavirus case had surfaced who had a flu swab just a few days before but had no travel history and no link to any known case the state laboratory finally able to begin testing confirmed the result the next morning the teenager who had recovered from his illness was located and informed just after he entered his school building he was sent home and the school was later closed as a precaution later that day the investigators and seattle health officials gathered with representatives of the c d c and the f d a to discuss what happened the message from the federal government was blunt what they said on that phone call very clearly was cease and desist to helen chu dr lindquist remembered stop testing still the troubling finding reshaped how officials understood the outbreak seattle flu study scientists quickly sequenced the genome of the virus finding a genetic variation also present in the country s first coronavirus case the implications were unnerving there was a good chance that the virus had been circulating silently in the community for around six weeks infecting potentially hundreds of people on a phone call the day after the c d c and f d a had told dr chu to stop officials relented but only partially the researchers recalled they would allow the study s laboratories to test cases and report the results only in future samples they would need to use a new consent form that explicitly mentioned that results of the coronavirus tests might be shared with the local health department they were not to test the thousands of samples that had already been collected the same day the f d a said it would relax its rules and allow clinical labs to begin using their own coronavirus tests as long as they submitted evidence that they worked to the agency under that new policy according to an agency representative on tuesday it had heard from 14 labs with 10 already beginning patient testing on march 2 the seattle flu study s institutional review board at the university of washington determined that it would be unethical for the researchers not to test and report the results in a public health emergency dr starita said since then her laboratory has found and reported numerous additional cases all of which have been confirmed as new samples came in dr starita s laboratory also worked their way backward through some older samples that had been sitting in the freezers for weeks finding cases that date back to at least feb 20 seven days before public health officials had any idea the virus was in the community the scientists said they believe that they will find evidence that the virus was infecting people even earlier and that they could have alerted authorities sooner if they had been allowed to test but on monday night state regulators enforcing medicare rules stepped in and again told them to stop until they could finish getting certified as a clinical laboratory a process that could take many weeks in the days since the teenager s test the seattle region has spun into crisis with dozens of people testing positive and at least 22 dying many of them infected in a nursing home that had unknowingly been suffering casualties since feb 19 the availability of testing for coronavirus remains uneven with some people able to easily obtain tests in certain parts of the country while others have been turned away some state officials fear that the virus is spreading far faster than the capacity for testing is increasing looking back dr chu said she understood why the regulations that stymied the flu study s efforts for weeks existed those protections are in place for a reason she said you want to protect human subjects you want to do things in an ethical way the frustration she said was how long it took to cut through red tape to try to save lives in an outbreak that had the potential to explode in washington state and spread in many other regions i don t think people knew that back then she said we know it now
