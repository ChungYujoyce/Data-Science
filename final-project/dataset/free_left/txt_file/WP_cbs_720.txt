lesley stahl speaks with land o lakes ceo beth ford about the challenges facing farmers today the opportunities technology offers and what it s like to be the only openly gay female ceo of a fortune 500 company american farmers are suffering facing a pileup of misfortunes president trump s tariffs record setting floods during spring planting and persistently low prices for their products the trump administration has promised nearly 20 billion in financial aid but so far just a third of that has reached farmers more than half of whom lost money last year a woman named beth ford has emerged as the farmer s advocate last year she became the ceo of land o lakes you re thinking that s the butter company and it is but it s also a multi billion dollar agricultural conglomerate that in one way or another affects half of all the farmland in america beth ford spends a lot of her time lobbying in washington and this spring she wrote an op ed piece titled farmers are in crisis and america isn t paying attention beth ford you ve got trade issues and tariff issues you ve got a changing consumer and what they want i mean there are so many variables right now pressuring farmers and this year right now the central issue for farmers is weather lesley stahl it s a bad time beth ford it s a challenging time beth ford s company land o lakes is in the fortune 500 with 15 billion in annual revenue its butter and cheese dominate the dairy case and its purina division feeds 100 million farm and zoo animals every day but it s still an old fashioned farmers cooperative founded almost 100 years ago so rather than answering to wall street analysts she reports to 4 000 farmers beth ford most people don t realize that that we re farmer owned that we really literally go back to the farm and then all the way to the retail shelf lesley stahl right so you work for the farmers beth ford i do lesley stahl you own them dave estrem yes dave estrem is one of the farmers beth ford works for lesley stahl you re her boss dave estrem well i m proud of it i m her boss yeah well i really don t want to say it that way but laugh lesley stahl but it s the truth dave estrem it is estrem grows corn and soybeans on the 4 000 acre minnesota farm that s been in his family for 75 years right now he s struggling to sell what s in his silos dave estrem we have two of them dedicated to soybeans this year this one s full of soybeans and then the other one at the far side of this is full of soybeans lesley stahl soybeans have been going to china dave estrem they used to lesley stahl they used to in the tariff tit for tat china has dramatically reduced purchases of u s soybeans and threatened to cut off all farm imports lesley stahl how bad is the hit from all these tariffs that are coming your way dave estrem we re feeling it it it s it s very difficult lesley stahl is it dramatic dave estrem it is beth ford yeah i think the export markets have been central to profitability for agriculture the loss of those markets has hit prices hard soybeans are now selling for around 9 a bushel beth ford normally you would want 10 or 11 per bushel so lesley stahl that s a big hit beth ford that s a very low price that means many farmers are losing money lesley stahl are people in this area this is supposedly trump s base is it beginning to hurt him at all beth ford more frustration is present because a number of people are going to lose their businesses they re gonna lose farms that they ve had in their families for generations lesley stahl so you think there may be a little softening dave estrem a little bit yeah adding to the economic woes dave estrem and farmers all across the midwest suffered through the wettest worst spring planting season on record dairy farmers are suffering too less from bad weather than from trade tensions with mexico and canada and historically low prices beth ford took us to a land o lakes dairy farm in pennsylvania run by sisters candice white and amanda condo amanda condo a lotta times our cost of production is higher than what we re getting paid for our product so it s it s been a few years of losing money lesley stahl actually losing money amanda condo yes beth ford i think there used to be 92 000 dairy producers in the country and now the last the number i saw was in the 50 000 level so 40 reduction land o lakes farmers are able to hang on because they share in the co op s overall profits that butter you buy at the grocery store provides some of those profits of course but the co op s most profitable division specializes in something called agtech and beth ford says that is going to be the key to farmers long term survival beth ford we use satellite technology we use predictive models we use all of the things that probably other businesses use but that people are unfamiliar with in terms of utilization in agriculture lesley stahl so up on your screen is this dave s farm teddy bekele so this is dave s farm this is where we were yesterday teddy bekele is land o lakes chief technology officer teddy bekele that s a picture from a satellite lesley stahl the satellite can tell how well the field is doing teddy bekele that s exactly right the satellite images are matched with a computer algorithm that feeds off of ten years worth of data from dave estrem s fields to create color coded prescriptions for each section of each plot teddy bekele in the red zones we re gonna do 28 000 seeds per acre in the yellow zones we ll do 32 000 seeds per acre in the green zones we ll do 38 000 seeds per acre you take this prescription and you put it into the planter and it plants it according to this prescription dave estrem on the acres that we plant it s all on the the computer or the tractor that runs the planter lesley stahl wait the wait the computer runs the planter dave estrem absolutely the computer runs the corn planter or bean planter and it tells it how many seeds to drop per acre dave estrem will tell you that getting that right matters because the cost of seed can make the difference between profit or loss as those seeds sprout and grow the satellites continue to monitor dave s fields and thousands of others teddy bekele so these images are taken every five to seven days so there s an image that comes in and you can see the different colors here and that gives us an idea of okay this field is trending down so let s go out there and and take a sample that s what we would do so what we could see from this sample is that the nitrogen and potassium are okay nitrogen s pretty good but the boron is is struggling a little bit so lesley stahl my my my it is really micro micro micro farming micromanaging teddy bekele micromanaging it absolutely absolutely that kind of detail allows farmers like dave estrem to use only as much fertilizer and pesticide as is absolutely necessary land o lakes says that saves farmers money and is better for the environment the company also plants hundreds of test fields using every conceivable combination of seed fertilizer weed and pest control to show farmers what ll work best on their fields lesley stahl is this an agricultural co op or a tech company laughter i m serious beth ford it s exciting it really is and i think most people don t understand that agriculture is so tech forward and it is and land o lakes dairy farmers are just as tech savvy teddy bekele so number one we use this thing called computer vision or image recognition he s talking about i kid you not facial recognition for cows teddy bekele so the machine now is using the technology and we re starting to see okay this cow is at ideal and as you can see i just recognized the cow it says is it ideal is it over or is it thin so those are the types of things we can lesley stahl and this machine would look at each and every cow in the herd teddy bekele that s right candice white we work very closely with a nutritionist candice white and amanda condo don t yet have that tool on their farm but they can run the whole place from their smartphones candice white we have this dairy dashboard lesley stahl ok candice white you know today we re milking 1 051 cows and how do they keep track of them candice white if you see on their front leg they have that little tag lesley stahl oh yeah candice white that is their fitbit lesley stahl oh my goodness look at that lesley stahl you are monitoring each cow separately multiple voices yes uh huh affirm lesley stahl and you can go out and say 3079 right over here isn t eating enough let s candice white uh huh affirm lesley stahl go over there and find out what s wrong multiple voices yeah uh huh affirm candice white that will track her milk production also in the milking parlor lesley stahl everything candice white yes beth ford i think people have this old school view of farming as slower than less than smaller than lesley stahl hayseed beth ford yeah and they re not they re very sophisticated businesspeople they are very tech savvy they have to be to withstand this kind of market pressure as beth ford visits her co op s farms she s finding that more and more of them are being run by women lesley stahl don t you think it s an assumption when people meet you and you say i m running a farm don t people think well their husbands are really doing it amanda condo yeah because i mean that s the typical stereotype right laugh it s it s the man the man is the farmer lesley stahl can i be honest i actually thought that amanda condo yeah just after ford became ceo land o lakes released a music video featuring amanda and candice to highlight the fact that one third of american farmers these days are women at 55 ford is in a very small club of women running fortune 500 companies beth ford innovation is our advantage at land o lakes but she stands alone as the only female ceo of a big company who s openly gay lesley stahl tell us about how it was discussed that you were gonna be the first gay female ceo beth ford it wasn t the announcement was simply that i was going to be named as ceo gave my background and then it simply just said in the last line of the announcement that i live in minneapolis with my wife jill and our three teenage children that was it matter of fact a single line lesley stahl but tell me about the reaction because it was explosive in a way beth ford it was a bit overwhelming and emotional for me and you know where most of that emotion comes from it comes from parents it comes from parents you know thank you for being lesley stahl of gay children beth ford yeah their children thank you my daughter has come out to me and she s 13 and i can share this with her and thank you cause now we can have a conversation about her life lesley stahl aren t you lucky that you live now beth ford i am lesley stahl i m sure you think of that all the time beth ford let s be very honest i mean that is absolutely true but when she began her business career more than 30 years ago she felt she had to keep it hidden mobil oil hired her right out of college lesley stahl any problems at work beth ford no because i wasn t lesley stahl you kept it secret beth ford well i did through my early thirties and i was working in line operations working in tanker and barge docks trucking facilities manufacturing facilities it wasn t really until my thirties that you know where i met jill who s my wife my spouse that i thought you know okay we re just moving on ford s wife jill shurtz is a west point grad and lawyer lesley stahl when did you get married beth ford when it was allowed but you know we ve been together for 26 now this is our 27th year lesley stahl oh my beth ford i have a daughter who s 17 and then twin boys lesley stahl who are what beth ford who are 14 and so yes we re in the middle of making the sausage we re doing our best like every other laugh family that s why i love it when i m with our members and they re talking about their family and then they re talking about their grandbabies or about their children it s a joy ford didn t grow up on a farm but she did grow up in farm country sioux city iowa the fifth in a family of eight children her first job was detasseling corn at age 12 and she s been working ever since beth ford i was a janitor i cleaned toilets i lesley stahl you cleaned toilets beth ford yes so i had a variety of jobs and again this is no different than our members you know three in the morning the pump in the manure pit s broken they re out there in the freezing snow this is why i admire our members and why i feel connected to them because they re willing to do the hard work and i i think that s terrific produced by rome hartman associate producer sara
