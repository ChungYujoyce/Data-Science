january i am in a strip club in morgantown west virginia drinking shit american beer that tastes like ice and newspaper a man is passing me a semi automatic handgun and telling me to pull the trigger the man is john barron the gun is a browning hi power it once belonged to an israeli police officer but now it belongs to jeff john s brother an early birthday present to himself together they own this strip club the blue parrot cabaret dark and sparse with a front door the color of cherry skin across the street is a place that sells all terrain vehicles two miles up the road a half dozen fraternity houses sit on top of a steep hill that your car will groan to climb john releases the magazine and holds the slide back to show me there s nothing in the chamber he is the type of man who could have worked at a video store or sold comic books or telescopes a man proud to be a connoisseur and now here he is in a building that jeff needed to mortgage his farm six years ago to help him open on the fringes of a college town the both of them sitting at a back table in a palace of human fantasies talking about guns while half naked women lead men upstairs by the hand to squishy leather love seats john passes the browning to me it s heavy and solid something that should be obvious but is still startling somehow immediately feel the trigger on that jeff says i do it feels smooth and light like pushing an elevator button except this is a thing designed for death printed on jeff s black t shirt in skinny white letters by reading this shirt you have given me brief control over your mind john and jeff take out another gun the recently released ruger american 9 mm pistol black and plastic y and then another a tiny 380 kel tec jeff s eyes flash down to the guns and then back up to me and then back down again all of them laid out on the counter welcome to west virginia he says i am in west virginia to understand donald trump at least to the extent that the political embodiment of a hardee s commercial needs to be understood specifically i m here to understand the people who want him to be president last december the new york times published a report based on statistics from civis analytics a democratic data firm that found west virginia to have the highest support for trump in the country in its first congressional district the northern part of the state where morgantown is located 45 percent of those polled said they would choose trump over any other g o p candidate on some level this isn t a surprise west virginia hasn t voted for a democrat in a presidential election since 1996 the state according to census data is 93 percent white and 88 percent native born and environmental restrictions targeting the coal industry the central nervous system of the west virginia economy have been taken by many as a personal assault a condemnation of the state s culture its history its blue collar virtues the mess of these things has brought obama s approval rating in west virginia as low as almost anywhere else in the country and so i have come here to meet people like john and jeff people who see trump as the renegade out for justice as someone who is not impulsive but decisive not cruel but honest not bombastic but patriotic not indecent but uninhibited you may wonder how could someone vote for a man so resistant to grace to convention to good taste and those people will tell you look where good taste brought us donald trump campaign supporters at a rally in richmond virginia one afternoon at the bluebird store in clarksburg part diner grocery store and social club i meet shane shreves a fourth generation union coal miner he wants trump to be president in 2015 he says he lost 262 miners to layoffs at his mine alone robinson run no 95 coal has carried west virginia on its back for 200 years he tells me it s built schools communities it s not anger we feel here really it s just very frustrating eric leaseburg the owner of the store sits down at a big round table with us he has a full plate of food in front of him shreves finishes a thought and then leaseburg says as he loads up his fork i don t even know if west virginians want to see trump president but they re just that pissed off and well if you re pissed off if your hopes for your stagnant town have wilted and died who better than donald trump america s tooth fairy emeritus he is a man who has turned the excruciating real life how are we keeping the lights on pissed off into something marketable a 140 characters version of pissed off something easily packaged and disseminated trump is politician as pickup artist as infomercial salesman someone who will in a single breath pulverize your self esteem and then convince you that he is the only one who can put you back together again speaking in empty hyperbole all love and disasters someone to resuscitate all of your sputtering little egos with something grand and implausible he loves everyone everything he s going to take you home tonight you have such beautiful eyes baby what are you doing here all alone i can make you great again donald trump is an american but before that he is a mogul a helicopter passenger a monolith of barely considered interjections his twitter feed is a scroll of grave warnings and half present admonishments of america down the shitter is it any wonder that the same day trump received an endorsement from sarah palin he also received one from the daughter of john wayne another counterfeit cowboy trump behaves like a man bored enough by fame and wealth that he can manufacture an adversarial relationship with a nation just to challenge it someone so aroused by the idea of being outrageous and condescending that it seems to almost border on erotic for him someone who has spent his life negotiating convincing selling you things you don t need for a price you can t afford he is selling not a commodity now but an inspirational hokum a life raft a rope ladder from a helicopter donald trump at the albemarle estate at his winery in virginia 150 miles from clarksburg west virginia i am getting coffee for my ride north stopping in charleston west virginia in gino s pizza spaghetti house there are posters on the wall for our famous pubwich and ginos original sicilian baked sub and old world pepperoni cheesy bread the pictures of the items on the posters look famous the way mug shots look famous the store manager cheryl hall has short blonde hair and punctuates every sentence with sweetie sugar honey baby putting her elbows on the counter to listen to you talk she moved from ohio to west virginia in 1982 and in april she ll have been working at gino s for 11 years i started and i didn t think much of it she says i didn t know it was gonna be a career i wish i was like my son sometimes he makes me realize maybe i m not so ambitious her son is 22 he s the light and the gift she says i ask her about the election me and my husband we almost don t wanna say it out loud but we kinda like trump his ideas he just doesn t have what s the word for it couth i make my way to clarksburg the two hour drive on i 79 empty and wide the sunset pure and purple and orange against the snow covered hills barren for miles and miles except for the little dots of civilization smoke coming from a house you can t see at first tire tracks in the dirt in west virginia no matter where you are you never feel far from nowhere i spend part of my night at the brickside bar grill just outside clarksburg the fifth largest city in the first district population according to the 2010 census 16 578 state motto jewel of the hills denny s locations one at brickside i meet a man named steve steve asks tammy the bartender for some menu guidance you can t go wrong with the steak hoagie she says where are your apps steve asks we have a sriracha agave wing sauce it s sriracha agave and spices they won t tell me about tammy says steve makes a face that says secret recipes are bullshit then he asks her if they still make the fried bologna sandwich they do he orders that and an order of the wings he tells tammy make sure they don t cook the hell out of the wings you know these pre cooked wings you don t need to cook them for 10 minutes like they say steve is a managing partner at the outback steakhouse near clarksburg so as a purveyor of mass consumed deep fried products he is something of an expert i ve worked in restaurants all my life he says the conversation turns to the imperiled local economy steve by way of explanation quotes a scene from dumb and dumber in which jim carrey s and jeff daniels s characters come back to their apartment after a day hunting for employment he recites daniels s line i can t believe there s no jobs in this town then carrey s yeah unless you wanna work 40 hours a week his sentences tend to start peacefully calculated then the words gather like storm clouds heading toward a profanity pieces of crust from his fried bologna sandwich falling onto his black pittsburgh steelers sweatshirt what this country is right now is a hornet s nest he has some more sandwich we drink beer i m all about conservation you know i love to fish i love the beauty of nature but china japan you think they give a shit about the environment but we re supposed to he continues it s the hypocrisy of it all you know like hollywood you remember clint eastwood he gets up there at the republican national convention in 2012 and he gets shredded and he s never been late on a movie set he s never been over budget but he gets shredded but then you have some of these actors up there these motherfuckers all think they re statesmen and some of them didn t even finish high school outside cheat river tavern in preston county west virginia before he leaves he gives me a list of places to visit around town it s one of the few moments in our conversation he speaks with an unrestrained love for something this will keep happening to me people talking about the decency of other west virginians and ordinary seeming food as if it were a dream they had outside at the brickside there is an enclosed patio with heat lamps and stationary towers that have flames spitting out of them a guy with dark bushy hair dances sloppily to love shack by the b 52s as someone else sings it in karaoke the waitress says to tammy that kid outside is kinda cute yeah tammy says the waitress adds i think that s because he s sort of hipster ish i don t know this apparently is progressivism in west virginia semi unkempt hair and an earring the d j shouts we got some nicki minaj coming at you and the crowd cheers like it hasn t all night like it s preparing to bungee jump over the waters of rap music and dangle there for a few moments then a bunch of west virginians with identical buzz cuts dance like they have nausea someone does the raise the roof motion a pretty tall blonde woman in a snug leather jacket indulges a dozen half advances from guys in hats bearing logos for golf brands or sporting goods chains i go back to the hotel my room looks out over a gas station and a place called eat n park its sign reads calories don t count if they smile the next day as i m walking around downtown clarksburg i see a tall man in his 70s jim hileman standing in the entrance of the lord s pantry food bank hileman is a trump supporter i support the man because he s crazy like me then he laughs in a tone somewhere between mall santa claus and batman villain hatching a diabolical plan he s been helping at the food pantry for about 10 years he started out volunteering after he left his job at a funeral home then he just kept doing it he tells me to get to ritz lunch at some point to try their hot dogs you have never heard people speak so fondly so intimately about hot dogs not like the nuances of them but their very existence the way you would talk about a grandmother or an old labrador it s part reverence part nostalgia i have never cared as much about anything as this man did about a hot dog recommendation it was sincere and beautiful him imparting this to someone a kind of treasure map two men are talking at a table when i walk into the bluebird store tobacco by itself probably doesn t even cause all those cancers it s the chemicals a man says he finishes eating and leans back in his chair that s a pretty good lunch right there now that s like a dinner it isn t a bad lunch it must be said i ask a woman named pam if i can sit down and eat next to her and her friend i tell her the purpose of this story and she almost deflates in her chair donald trump alters her posture literally we always get dumped on she says there s this idea of west virginians as bumpkins or whatever but kentucky has rural areas too you know no one thinks of them like this i hate to see us in a poll like that leading for trump because it almost makes us look dumber at first i thought wow he ll go where no one else goes we need that but the more i hear him the more i think he s just dangerous across town there are people trudging through the snow pushing strollers around puddles catching their breath outside the dairy queen i walk into the humane society thrift store there are bottles of half used lotion open boxes of band aids for sale a playpen full of stuffed animals a bookshelf with a bundle of plastic bags tacked to it and a sign that reads in black marker books 50 bag next to the cash register a donald j trump brand shirt that looks like everything he has ever worn white cuffs and white collar a shade of blue that is just a little brighter and bluer than it needs to be a volunteer named joyce insani looks at it and says is anyone even gonna buy this shirt another volunteer named becky steptoe walks by careful what you say about our next president she says i ask becky if she likes that idea well the country is a business i think we need a businessman to run it joyce is wearing a fleece vest the color of pink jelly beans i ask her what she thinks i don t really know what to think about him he s very successful so he s got to be smart she s sorting women s tops while she tells me this but i don t think we ll be able to fix this till we restore our faith in god there are pockets all over west virginia where business is something simple and utilitarian practical hand painted signs hanging from stores that say junk junk and beneath it pots and pans and brooms and plastic lawn chairs the next day i head to the northeast through towns of a few hundred people towns that are 97 percent white grafton and 99 percent rowlesburg i pass cemeteries and trucks that look abandoned rusty machinery in backyards everywhere there are things leaning teetering you might consider this metaphorically but it is literally true the houses are breaking i pass small shops and enterprises one after another places called morgan s muffler inspection and dave s autobody larew s used car jack s car wash debbie s pantry a human with a name who had an idea for a place to do a thing and then did it i pull into a roadside restaurant in grafton called biggie s in the magazine rack behind two candy machines that sell skittles for a quarter is a december 7 issue of the tabloid the globe on the cover in all capital letters impeach obama and a crosshair over the statue of liberty there is one other customer inside biggie s he s a corrections officer at the pruntytown correctional center he has pale blue eyes and dime size pupils that make everything he says seem wild and intense and on the verge of recklessness i like the idea of donald trump he s going to run it like a business he don t care who he offends he s gonna pull no punches one of the things america was formed on was saying what you feel we built this country on offending people he won t give me his name and i don t make any progress asking a second and third time you don t need my name farther east the town of rowlesburg used to house the largest sawmill factory in the country now it has a population of 584 three bars are boarded up the church is closed and the vfw s walk isn t shoveled at the sidetracked bar and grill the bar is empty for the hour i m there two trains pass mary goff is standing behind the counter in front of two tap handles bud light and budweiser i ask for a budweiser but they don t have any beer yet they ve been waiting months for their license i ask goff what she thinks about trump he s maybe not the greatest person in the world she explains but he s a businessman when west virginians talk about the man there is a mystique an almost shamanistic wisdom granted to business people anything associated with tycoons or their largesse the implied clout and sophistication of a new yorker in a shiny pink tie i ll be honest with you one college kid named eric tells me later that night at a bar in morgantown trump has a ball sack but i don t know if he knows what the fuck he s doing his friend erik leans in but can you imagine him approaching like saudi arabia or something with that kind of mentality eric interjects before reason can get in the way he ll be fine he says nodding confidently and that really is its own sort of currency trump s red lining testosterone his brazen dismissals of rivals the way he duels with other candidates in ways that have nothing to do with policy but everything to do with something essential about being a human getting embarrassed and ignored in public when trump says rubio i ve never seen a young guy sweat that much he s winning in a way that seems irrelevant but also sort of irrefutable view of norfolk supporters at a donald trump rally in october the blue parrot almost never opened in the first place jeff and john began renovations in march of 2010 but by mid april the town was trying to stop them eventually the county passed an ordinance that prohibited adult entertainment venues from operating within 2 000 feet of churches schools or residential areas but only after the blue parrot cabaret was grandfathered in and the county still fought them six years later the club s still here we had a terrible terrible time john says there was no winning or losing there was only winning once everything you own is on the line it s no longer options it s no longer choices it s going to work i m talking to john about how the state s population has hovered at around 2 million for the last 70 years rounding myself into the same sort of defeatism i ve heard in the people i ve met here he describes for me how the literal topography the shape of the earth restricts what sort of industries can survive i ask him how it s possible to not walk around mad all the time then jeff says from a few steps away well you do i think that s why trump appeals what do you do about any of this a lot of what gets done in west virginia is through brute force he says i imagine all these people left on their own stranded forgotten i think about what albert camus said in the stranger it was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean emptied me of hope and gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars for the first time the first i laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe i find no bumpkins in west virginia nor do i find any trump shrines the only political paraphernalia i see over three and a half days is for bernie sanders instead of the burbling hints of a revolution i find a pervading sense of resignation people drift occasionally into states of indignation or anger but mostly they express ambivalence these are people who are familiar with dense winter skies interstates that stretch and bend over the horizon things that feel all around like they re breaking or on an incline or carved through rock or forest or around rivers whether trump exists to you as vine superstar or a political pioneer or the hellion king in the cockpit of a kamikaze mission something seems inescapable this is west virginia this is its plight things giant and immovable and so i imagine you can get mad at the democrats at the idea of political correctness at the grinding wheels of bureaucracy at the notion of people trying to take your guns or your strip club or your job digging coal from the earth at the passing train that momentarily brings your dying little town to a halt at the person who keeps asking you for your name you can be furious at things so big and maddeningly abstract that a tyrannosaur parade float of a man seems like a savior but sometimes all you can do is get mad at the mountains donald trump has zeroed in on america s percolating xenophobic aggression harnessed the impulses behind it and tried to amplify them using simple as that declarations that he will ban muslims and syrians and build walls file lawsuits circling the wagons and rebuilding transforming delicate takes time restraint takes time sledgehammers get right to it there are people either tantalized by the mirage tantalized by a man who would so shamelessly peddle the mirage or leveled enough by rhetoric and empty idealism that they don t have time for any of it sometimes the mirage looks pretty sometimes the mirage looks real sometimes it s a con and we know it on the last day of my trip a man with a beard creeping high up his cheeks and a 30 case of busch light in one hand is on his way out of a convenience store we talk about presidents he s holding the door open now with his foot wedged at the bottom the cuffs of his pants torn and caked with mud as people come in and out of the store i ask him if he likes trump if he likes anyone if he cares it s starting to snow he turns and spits a long stream of black tobacco juice through the air and then he looks back at me whoever it is he says if they ain t a thief now they will be by the time they in office then he s gone will be used in accordance with our privacy policy more from vanity fair contact 2020 cond
