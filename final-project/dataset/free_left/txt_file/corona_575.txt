hong kong lining up his camera s viewfinder as he documented a protest related to the coronavirus outbreak oscar chan noticed a police officer pointing a canister right back at him the pepper spray blasted the student journalist in the face as he clicked the shutter three officers surrounded him as he tried to wash his eye chan said as their colleague demanded his arrest they affixed plastic cuffs so tightly they left scratches and bruises before charging him with theft for possessing a transit card that provides discounts for the elderly they kept calling me a black journalist said chan 24 a term that implied he was posing as a reporter the officer who had sprayed him berated him with homophobic slurs and threatened to rape him he said after widespread unrest in 2019 dissent in hong kong is evolving in the coronavirus era with the risk of infection deterring large scale rallies at least temporarily protests now involve localized spontaneous flare ups or strikes but a lack of faith in authorities response to the epidemic has deepened anti government sentiment leader carrie lam s satisfaction rating is at a record low according to the hong kong public opinion research institute at the feb 8 protest chan documented some were commemorating a student s death following a police operation while others were protesting government plans to establish quarantine facilities for coronavirus patients in their neighborhood slogans of five demands not one less the refrain of hong kong s democracy movement mixed with calls for a revolution against the virus confronted with this form of unrest hong kong s police now clad in surgical masks are deploying the same response mass arrests of the more than 7 300 people arrested since june one tenth were detained this year despite the smaller scale and frequency of protests among them are student journalists civil rights observers elected officials and medics on friday police arrested jimmy lai a media tycoon known for his criticism of the chinese government on charges of unlawful assembly related to a protest in august and on saturday violent protests flared again the most serious clashes between police and protesters in weeks leading to the arrest of 121 people police say they are empowered to apprehend any person if there s reason to believe they have committed a crime in a statement to the legislature last week police added that officers will always strive to protect the privacy and rights of detained persons the force did not respond to questions from the washington post about mass arrests and treatment of detainees hong kong resists full border closure with china amid coronavirus threat the wave of arrests during a public health crisis is compounding mistrust between hong kong residents and the city s leaders who are not directly elected and are widely perceived as serving the interests of the chinese communist party before the hong kong people as prosecutors prepare to bring hundreds to trial on riot charges stemming from the pro democracy rebellion the tactics are setting up a new flash point arrests are what beijing and the hong kong government thinks may work and so they keep on this hard line approach said eric cheung a legal scholar at the university of hong kong the assessment is that in the end there would only be a limited number of people who are prepared to risk their liberty and life to fight and protest they may be right in that sense he added but it doesn t address the root problems and so one day there will be another round on feb 8 protests flared in several districts as residents fearful of coronavirus infection pushed back against officials plans to set up quarantine facilities tactics demonstrators honed last year road barricades molotov cocktails vandalism were now employed toward a different goal in a statement on twitter police said protesters in the tseung kwan o neighborhood had blocked roads with barricades damaged traffic lights dug up bricks on the sidewalk and threw them on the thoroughfare police arrested 119 people including chan another reporter and five lower level elected officials we appeal to members of the public not to break the law police said ben chung head of the local district council and other elected officials arrived at an apartment block that night after hearing from an anxious resident whose daughter had been arrested it is my duty to be at the scene district councilors are responsible for their district and we were there to see if the police were carrying out their duties properly chung said hong kong s protest art shifts from street clashes to virus panic but the leaders remain the villains within an hour police were rounding up everyone present chung and his colleagues were detained he said along with others including a social worker and a tourist from mainland china they were kept overnight on charges of participating in an unlawful assembly and released on bail as elected officials we were simply trying to liaise with the public and the police and to minimize confrontation and clashes but it seems the police don t understand that he said before the coronavirus outbreak chinese leaders urged hong kong to crack down on the pro democracy protests branding them a threat to the one country two systems framework that gives the territory partial autonomy in february beijing replaced its top official in hong kong with a hard liner known for suppressing christian churches in zhejiang province lawyers and legal scholars say hong kong s police in seeking to bolster weak cases in court are resorting to extrajudicial evidence gathering tactics joe chan a barrister who is among a group of pro bono lawyers representing arrested protesters said clients have complained that police forced them to hand over phone passcodes a process that requires a court warrant under hong kong law clients he said have been asked by police to pose for evidentiary photos while wearing full face respirators helmets and masks even if those items did not belong to them potentially to implicate a person as having participated in a protest there is no legal basis for the police to ask them to do such things chan said we have complained in open court about this practice a few times in hong kong toilet paper is in short supply trust in the government is even more scarce others complain too that police have widened their dragnet to arrest not only violent protesters but human rights observers journalists medics and others in contravention of international standards last month 24 human rights organizations including amnesty international wrote to lam imploring authorities to cease investigations into human rights observers arrested in recent months obviously they ve changed their strategy icarus wong founder of civil rights observer said of the police who detained three of his monitors jan 1 they ve made it very clear that they don t consider anyone who is at a protest to be innocent of wrongdoing other protesters and civil observers said the strategy of mass arrests had made them less willing to take to the streets it is like a yellow card in a football match said chung the district councilor it almost feels like these arrests are preemptive to make you behave yourself and stop you from coming out again chan the student journalist has grown tired of documenting clashes and is seeking other ways to support pro democracy causes even if i want to reject the idea and pretend that i am not scared after my arrest the simple truth is that the police strategy really works he said tiffany liang contributed to this report in hong kong crackdown police broke their own rules and faced no consequences toilet paper is in short supply trust in the
