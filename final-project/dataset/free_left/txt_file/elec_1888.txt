with breanne deppisch the big idea raleigh n c ayana mcallister went to hillary clinton s rally two weekends ago at st augustine s university the historically black school where she s a freshman she watched the democratic nominee speak alongside the mothers of trayvon martin and sandra bland but on the eve of the election the 18 year old is still not 100 percent sold i don t know said mcallister a native of largo md i feel like i ve got to settle for hillary i feel like i m going to vote because i know i need to not because i want to i feel like neither of them should be president but i feel like hillary will be better really it s like two children arguing back and forth this was a common refrain during interviews at yesterday s football game here between st augustine and crosstown rival shaw university another historically black institution early voting numbers and polling suggest that african american turnout is down nationally this year compared to 2012 and 2008 though there are some signs that the gap has been closing in recent days alarm bells have clearly gone off inside the clinton high command many students at the schools here in raleigh regret that they never got to vote for barack obama they are collectively disappointed that their first time forces them to choose between clinton and donald trump but they plan to vote nonetheless in fact teachers have told them that in lieu of class they will march to the polls on tuesday i am not a fan of either one but of the two i will probably be voting for hillary said anoviua rush a freshman from durham she s just a liar and hillary is not even good at backing up her lies everyone makes mistakes but when you try to cover them up it s a problem as a marching band performed behind her under a cloudless sky on a perfect fall day rush explained that the prospect of electing the first woman president does not motivate her but clinton s support for equal pay legislation does she s more understanding of minorities and what we go through said rush i m not going to say he s racist but he s said some messed up stuff about minorities donald s main focus seems to be helping the wealthy and i ll say it possibly caucasians a lot of people are very discouraged very very discouraged said felishia mcpherson 47 who was wearing a black lives matter t shirt really it s like you re choosing between a liar and a clown but who doesn t lie we all lie i m a mental health counselor i know that psychologically in order to want to be president you ve got to be a little narcissistic to start with trump was never an option for me i don t love hillary but i don t have to she s not coming to my house she s going to the white house mcpherson already voted early for clinton she brought her seven year old niece malia named after the president s daughter to obama s rally in fayetteville on friday i don t know if i actually believe in the political system as far as does my one vote count but i m not going to take a chance of it not counting she explained afterward if the system really does work then i m going to participate if it doesn t then i still did the best i could by my ancestors i do believe with obama s encouragement even though we may not believe in the system we know we need to do it several elderly african americans expressed deep concern that millennials including their grandchildren do not sufficiently appreciate the importance of voting irene hill thomas 79 is a retired special education teacher who now spends most of her time volunteering at church and a food pantry in sampson county if you ve been around long enough your eyes are open she said you appreciate it because you fought for it the younger generation hasn t been there they don t know the younger generation doesn t understand there was a time when we had to sit at the back of the bus and had no say so i remember the white and the colored fountains they don t north carolina was the closest state obama won in 2008 and the closest state he lost in 2012 african americans accounted for 23 percent of the electorate both times and obama won almost all of them reflecting the importance of the 15 electoral votes up for grabs in north carolina and the strategic significance of the research triangle specifically both candidates will return to raleigh on monday trump will give an afternoon speech at the state fairgrounds and clinton will hold the final rally of her campaign here at midnight another very important explanation for why african american turnout is down in north carolina republicans have worked to limit early voting locations and hours the executive director of the state republican party persuaded gop county officials to limit early voting in troubling emails that have been unearthed by public records requests he pushed to limit the number of hours sites were open especially evenings and sundays when many african americans typically cast ballots after church services in the democratic leaning county that includes greensboro the state s third largest there were 16 early voting sites in 2012 during the first week that polls were open this year there was just one so while 61 000 people voted during the first week four years ago only 8 000 did this year after that first week 25 voting sites were opened and turnout records were broken i shadowed a field staffer from the afl cio affiliate group working america as she canvassed in a predominantly black section of raleigh yesterday afternoon walking across lawns in a hilly neighborhood just off martin luther king jr blvd andrea vogler urged folks to go vote during a period of just one hour though half a dozen african americans separately complained that they tried to vote early but the lines were too long so they came home they all said they hope to still go on tuesday but what if the lines are long then too will they stick around a woman in a nurse s uniform said she went by the early voting site three times over the past week but the lines were too long each time a younger man named victor came to his door in red checkered pajamas he had gone earlier in the day too but said he was too tired to stand around he works a night shift so he said he s going to try voting on his drive home from work at 6 30 a m tuesday which he hopes will be before a crowd forms i ve heard that on a couple of different days now vogler 32 lamented as she walked to the next house on the one hand it is good people are trying to vote on the other i hope it doesn t deter anyone from actually voting a woman named barbara pulling out of her driveway in a chevy trailblazer with her infant son in the backseat is one of the people who gave up when she saw the lines damien her husband was who vogler had come to talk with barbara warned her that he was sleeping but every vote counts so the canvasser went to knock on the door anyway he was nonplussed i worked all damn night 12 hours he said his eyes bloodshot i just want to go back to my bed she tried to hand him a piece of paper with bullet points on why he should vote for clinton he grimaced and refused to take it working america has about 700 field staffers farmed out across nine states they have had 573 400 conversations with voters since launching this summer including 45 500 in north carolina in the raleigh area alone the labor group had seven vans with five to seven people in each hitting doors on saturday the group largely targets african american and latino voters though some swing whiterepublicans are in their universe an older man sitting in his green chevy lumina picking his teeth with a toothpick outside a row of ground level studio apartments told vogler that he planned to vote later in the afternoon she informed him that early voting had ended for the day and that saturday was the final opportunity until tuesday damn he replied north carolina is the most important state vogler stressed over and over again you ve got to get out to vote in an interview late last night i asked democratic senate candidate deborah ross who is in a neck and neck race with sen richard burr that may decide which party controls the majority about all these people who said they did not vote early because of the lines it s by design she complained but she argued that this will also galvanize many african americans on tuesday i don t think anything is going to keep people from voting this year she said ross a former state representative who sponsored 2007 legislation allowing for same day voter registration which was pivotal to obama carrying the state a year later noted that for every person who returned home when they saw the crowded early voting sites many more waited around there were people who stood for hours in line she said the weather forecast for tuesday looks good and she believes this might make the difference in her razor thin race i think we re going to see long lines on election day ross predicted with a southern twang we re going to turn people out a clinton campaign official speaking anonymously said they were worried during the first week of early voting but the fact that hundreds of additional sites wound up opening for the second week made the situation much better and led to a huge increase in turnout but allies say clinton may need to perform especially well on election day to offset votes that were lost over the past two weeks surrogates have also streamed into the state to drive african americans to the polls civil rights icon john lewis headlined a march in charlotte on thursday cory booker came friday night other efforts are underway too the national president of the sierra club was outside the st augustine s football game handing out biscuits from bojangles and urging young people to support clinton in order to advance environmental issues the president himself has now spoken at five rallies for clinton in north carolina addressing a crowd of 2 500 that was probably 95 percent black in fayetteville on friday he made a very explicit pitch right now donald trump is calling on his supporters to monitor certain areas on election day obama said i don t know what certain areas he s talking about but you do he finished his speech with the story of a 100 year old woman who was purged from the north carolina voter rolls after a republican challenged her registration status on flimsy grounds grace bell hardison was mentioned in an naacp lawsuit that prompted a federal judge to issue an injunction on friday north carolina election officials are now scrambling to restore the rights of thousands of voters most black and democratic who had been cut from the rolls under a so called individual challenge law so young people i want you to understand this obama said it wasn t that long ago when folks had to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar or the number of bubbles on a bar of soap it wasn t that long ago folks were beaten trying to register voters in mississippi if you ve been marching for criminal justice reform that s great but you still need to vote if you vote we ll win north carolina and if we win north carolina hillary clinton will be president while you were sleeping trump was rushed offstage during a campaign rally in reno last night after a man reportedly yelled gun but the gop nominee emerged back onstage after a brief period to finish his speech secret service officials said agents apprehended the man but found no weapon the man who identified himself as austyn crites 33 was reportedly released after the event telling reporters that he was attacked for holding a republicans against trump sign when i pulled out the sign people around me were trying to grab the sign crites said and so all that was occurring

throughout the fall florida north carolina ohio and pennsylvania obama won those four in 2008 and all of them but north carolina in 2012 until recently it appeared that trump needed to sweep all four to overcome clinton s electoral map advantage but as the race has tightened ohio seems to have moved into the republican column and other states outside those four have potentially come into play the gop nominee is looking to states including michigan and new hampshire to make up a potential deficit should he not win florida north carolina and pennsylvania in trump s case it is an effort to grab

despite every poll putting her significantly ahead trump and pence are also both going there fourteen percent of the electorate is african american the clinton campaign is trying to downplayits late efforts in michigan look if we hold onto nevada and hold onto michigan then hillary clinton is going to be the next president of the united states john podesta said on meet the press this morning most people vote on election day in michigan so our schedule has been oriented to being in the early vote states in the earlier period of time stephen neuman a senior adviser to the democratic coordinated

acknowledged that polls have has tightened in michigan but added i feel very confident about how we re going to do john wagner and anne gearan trump seems to have given up on wisconsin aides told me last week that he d probably go back multiple times including to the milwaukee suburbs he s not even going to come back once to the badger state but now he s going to minnesota where he has absolutely not a snowball s chance the campaign said it has done polling there but maggie haberman of the times tweeted that this is a lie the latest indignity for the speaker trump cancels wisconsin rally just

was floated and quickly yanked away the republican nominee earlier this week scheduled a sunday afternoon rally in west allis just outside milwaukee it was to be trump s sixth wisconsin event since he lost the state s primary election we don t know if it s scheduled firm or not yet but i intend to do it if he s here ryan told reporters saturday when asked if he would attend the trump rally if our nominee comes we ll campaign with him seconds later a spokesman for trump s wisconsin campaign alerted reporters that the event had been canceled ryan stumped alongside mike pence yesterday but perplexingly trump and pence have not given up on virginia adding several stops and deploying key surrogates trump s decision to appear in a populous purple washingtonexurbcuts against his broader strategy of running up the vote in heavily red rural areas lauravozzellawrites much of his last minute appeals have been in tiny burgs like selma n c population 6 000 his foray into northern virginia appears to be a bid to hold down clinton s margins in a region that excluding theexurbs leans heavily democratic bigger picture trump s schedule belies the biggest challenge facing him right now it s not clear where and how he would win of all of trump s must win states the only one where mr trump has really been close in the polls is nevada writes theupshot s nate cohn but nevada is also the state where we know the most about the results because of early voting and it hasn t brought good news for mr trump perhaps mr trump will mount a huge comeback in nevada on election day or maybe democrats are much weaker among registered democrats or unaffiliated voters than most analysts believe but if mrs clinton does indeed have a big advantage in nevada then his chances start looking very bleak he s at a disadvantage in the polls of all of the other states that could put him over the top what s more it s not really clear where he has his best chance something reflected in mr trump s unfocused pre election push updates from the battlegrounds a deep dive on the national mood fifteen of our reporters traveled the country talking to voters and report on deep anxiety and some lingering traces of optimism only eight years after millions of americans poured into the streets in spontaneous joyful celebration of the election of the nation s first black president optimism seems to have been sucked out of the country s marrow replaced by a heavy anxiety a sense that things aren t right and can t easily be fixed early voting trends in floridaappear to narrowly favor clinton the democrats lead of 7 280 ballots cast pales in comparison to their advantage of about 104 000 early and absentee votes four years ago however the state s voter rolls have shifted significantly and neither republicans nor democrats can lay claim to having a clear advantage politico s marc caputo writes i think it s trending well for hrc but it s definitely a toss up state says democratic consultant steve schale who helped lead obama s efforts in the sunshine state in 2008 and 2012 read his latest memo on the early vote jon ralston the dean of the nevada press corps predicts a deep blue wave in the notoriously hard to poll silver state trump may have been here this weekend believing in the polls that show him ahead or competitive here but like bruce willis in the sixth sense spoiler alert he does not realize he is dead the democratic early voting effort which was much more difficult with a nominee so many democrats don t like or trust has been impressive a valedictory statement from the reid machine yes 2016 is not 2012 hillary clinton is not barack obama plenty of votes will be cast tuesday but about two thirds of the votes already have been banked if the past is prologue the only real question i think is how deep the blue wave goes the supreme court moved to allow an arizona ballot collection law barring organizers from picking up ballots and delivering them to election stations the move is an eleventh hour blow to democrats who argue that the ruling could disenfranchise thousands of minority voters cnn chris christie canceled four new hampshire stops on behalf of trump yesterday following the convictions of two former top aides for their role in the 2013 bridgegate scandal the new jersey governor is doing an interview today with charlie rose to try cleaning up the mess imagine is christie was the republican nominee and those convictions got handed down the friday before the election wmur faithless elector alert a washington state democratic elector said he is refusing to vote for clinton even if she wins the popular vote facing the potential of a 1 000 fine he told the ap he doesn t care this could matter if the election is really close some are still bernie or bust sanders went to iowa state university in ames yesterday to lead a rally for clinton one of the warm up speakers was kaleb vanfosson the president of the young democratic socialists group at the school he was supposed to give a speech about the need for unity but instead he took the stage and started talking about how terrible hillary is she is so trapped in the world of the elite the sophomore in political science said she has completely lost grip of what it s like to be an average person he added that there was no point in voting for the lesser of two evils it took about a minute of this before a clinton staffer escorted him off the stage here s the story from the student paper and here s the video the ap released its finalelectoral forecastthis morning the daily hillary tim kaine made headlines after suggesting that some inside the fbi are actively working to support trump s campaign from ed o keefe in a miami interview kaine called the fbi a leaky sieve and accused jim comey of breaking protocol by announcing his email investigation so close to an election he also dismissed trump ally rudy giuliani s decision to back off claims that he giuliani had been given advance notice of the fbi s plans to possibly reopen the clinton investigation i don t think giuliani s walk back is credible the virginia senator said referring to giuliani s preemptive announcement that the fbi had a big announcement to come i think the fbi sadly has become like a leaky sieve he added new york times if clinton moves to oval office aides baggage may be heavy by matt flegenheimer and mark landler in the final sprint of her campaign troubled by an f b i inquiry and narrowing polls clinton has held tightly to a handful of advisers who have spent their careers protecting her interests defending her reputation and at times sullying it and their own and if she wins on tuesday the most telling test of mrs clinton s transition back to power will arrive quickly after a campaign season often defined by voters weariness with and distrust of her which old hands will or should follow her into the oval office almost no top adviser has been left untouched by the two central firestorms of mrs clinton s candidacy the inquiry into her use of a private email server and the wikileaks hack of campaign chairman john podesta the unvarnished view of infighting in the stolen documents is unlikely to bother mrs clinton much friends say the political wisdom of importing excess baggage to the executive branch is another matter boston globe a1 9 moments that molded the campaign by matt viser and annie linskey when planning the democratic convention in philadelphia clinton campaign officials didn t initially include michelle obama as a featured speaker according to a democratic strategist familiar with the plans for clinton s campaign it made sense to put her on the rostrum on the tumultuous opening day when bernie sanders and elizabeth warren were both to speak we thought it would be hard for sanders people to boo michelle obama said the person who isn t authorized to talk about the first lady s deliberations another revelation the trump campaign was warned months in advance to be ready for clinton s attack over alicia machado but did nothing new yorker meet maya harris hillary clinton s progressive link by emily greenhouse to speak with those who have worked with harris is to be bulldozed with superlatives mary kay henry the president of the service employees international union who worked with harris recently on the democratic party platform told me that she lives her life on a moral crusade on all of those justice issues she carries her peeps our peeps with her in everything she does beyond policy harris seems to offer in her very person solutions to some of clinton s image problems the daily donald the owners of thenational enquirer reportedly paid to shield trump from allegations of a former playboy model who claims they had an affair paying 150 000 for rights to her story before declining to publish it from the wall street journal s joe palazzolo michael rothfeld and lukas i alpert the tabloid newspaper publisher reached an agreement in early august with karen mcdougal the 1998 playmate of the year american media inc which owns the enquirer hasn t published anything about what she has told friends

kill in a written statement the company said it wasn t buying ms mcdougal s story for 150 000 but rather two years worth of her fitness columns and magazine covers as well as exclusive life rights to

an empire moving downhill and the spin doctors of the kremlin see cause for pure and unambiguous delight the u s presidential election america s quadrennial chance to showcase for the world how democracy works in the most powerful nation on earth has become instead an object lesson in everything that ails a country long seen as a beacon of freedom and hope people in small and distant countries who count on the u s to stand up for democratic values have been astonished to see essential components trammeled long standing allies have been left to wonder whether the u s can be relied on when it counts and even though the campaign still has days to go with the outcome very much in doubt the damage to american moral standing may already be done quote du jour america always spoke to arab countries as if they had so much to learn said a 27 year old beirut caf worker who says he has been closely watching the election ever since he read about trump s sexual assault boasts and now we

campaigns an australian public relations consultant noted that state lawmakers in sydney recently adopted a resolution by unanimous consent describing trump as a revolting slug unfit for office the pundits weigh in the idea that tuesday will end our partisan rancor is a na ve fantasy writesfrank bruni there s no end here just a punctuation mark a measly comma between the rancor that has built until this point and the fury to come and there s no way to un see what all of us have seen over these last 18 months to bottle up what has been un bottled election day will redeem and settle nothing not this time around whether balloons fall on clinton or trump there will be bolder divisions in america than there were at the start of it all and even less faith in the country s most important institutions even putting trump s angry troops aside it feels as if we re coming out of this election with four parties the paul ryan republicans the freedom caucus the establishment democrats and the elizabeth warren bernie sanders brigade meet the new paralysis same as the old paralysis potentially worse from elections past i don t recognize this terrain how can i assume that it s navigable if trump loses the party faces a daunting reconstruction challenge says conservative columnist peter wehner who served in the bush and reagan administrations policies that promote economic growth social mobility and greater opportunity are important but in some respects the party s stance here is a secondary priority republicans need to wrestle with more fundamental questions first will their party choose as its leaders people who respect democratic institutions and traditions or not who conceive of america as a welcoming society or as one that is racially and religiously closed who abhor ignorance or embrace it in a post trump world republicans need to ask themselves if their party will be characterized by its aspirations or its resentments can it make its own inner peace with living in an increasingly diverse and nonwhite america does it conceive of its role as tamping down or inflaming ugly passions does it believe in a just social order or not the next few months will tell us a lot about whether mr trump and trumpism were an anomaly or are now the new norm of the party that lincoln helped create when historians write about this bizarre ugly and dispiriting campaign the epic dark saga will unfold this way a man filled with fear and insecurity created a hatemongering character and followed it out the window and a woman filled with fear and insecurity hunkered down and repeated bad patterns rather than reimagining herself in an open bold way maureen dowd writes before he jumped into the presidential race trump was seen as bombastic vulgar a bit of a buffoon and a cave man but also a cheeky brio he was not regarded as a bigot or demagogue he was seen as a playboy not a predator but he created another character for the republican primaries playing to the feral instincts of angry voters encouraging violence at his rallies hatred toward journalists and disrespect for democracy itself he s so used to playing a role in different areas of his life said tv personality donny deutsch he saw the crowd s adulation and it drove him he started to get the biggest cheers for saying the most offensive things the new yorker s jeffrey toobin dubbed this election clinton investigation mania part two bill clinton s presidency was defined for the most part by criminal and congressional investigations he writes the subjects of those probes sound like entries in a nineteen nineties time capsule whitewater filegate travelgate it may be that republicans spent so much time in pursuit of bill clinton s scalp because things were mostly going well otherwise the economy boomed and the nation was at peace so congress took a vacation from its responsibilities to investigate a decade old arkansas land deal in which the clintons lost money but real dangers abound in the unstable world of today the economy is only tenuously prosperous and a warming planet notwithstanding the lack of interest among debate moderators threatens apocalyptic change a politics based on pursuit and accusation rather than on reason and compromise will address none of these problems and the prospect of four years of governance that resemble the last days of this campaign is one that would drive anyone to drink from the editorial boards averting the worst starts with electing hillary clinton says the new york times editorial board for many voters that will mean defying republican efforts to jam the electoral machinery through lies legal obstructions and the threat of violence we hope the voters hold out however intimidating the process and long the lines for americans who may feel unmoved or unwilling to vote for mrs clinton here is a question from the future in 2016 we were closer than ever to electing an ignorant and reckless tyrant what did you do to stop him there s no sense complaining anymore the hurricane is three days from landfall the urgent thing now is to avert the worst minimize the damage save the foundations clear the mess the wall street journal hasn t endorsed a presidential candidate since 1928 and if we didn t endorse ronald reagan we aren t about to revive the practice for mrs clinton or mr trump the journal s board declares a broken washington
