watch cbsn live by irina ivanova updated on september 18 2019 4 25 pm moneywatch the federal reserve further cut interest rates wednesday as it tries to extend the u s economic expansion in the face of president donald trump s trade war with china and geopolitical risks such as the attacks on saudi arabia s oil facilities the fed trimmed rates modestly to a range between 1 75 and 2 it was its second rate cut this year after the central bank cut rates july 30 for the first time in a decade in announcing the cut the fed cited lower business investments and exports as well as persistently low inflation that suggests more economic sluggishness than the central bank wants fed chairman jerome powell also said wednesday that the fed could cut rates even further if the trade war were to escalate and drag down growth if the economy does turn down a sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate powell told reporters wednesday afternoon while adding that the fed s rate setting body doesn t predict a downturn mr trump meanwhile has kept up a stream of public attacks on the central bank s policymaking shortly after the fed s announcement the president tweeted jay powell and the federal reserve fail again no guts no sense no vision a terrible communicator jay powell and the federal reserve fail again no guts no sense no vision a terrible communicator he had recently called the central bank leadership team boneheads despite a still solid job market and brisk spending by consumers the president has insisted that the fed slash its benchmark rate aggressively even to below zero as the european central bank has done in part to weaken the u s dollar and make american exports more competitive powell poured cold water on that idea wednesday saying that even in a recession i do not think we ll be using negative interest rates but he defended the fed s use of rate cuts as a counter to the negative effects of mr trump s trade policy anything that affects the achievement of our goals is something that monetary policy could address he said the thing we can t address really is what businesses would like which is a settled roadmap for international trade he continued but we do have a very powerful tool that can support demand through sound monetary policy how low the fed s rates will go remains an open question just seven of the 17 members on the fed s rate setting body predicted an additional rate cut this year according to economic projections released wednesday and wednesday s decision to cut rates was split two members esther george and eric rosengren did not want to cut rates while james bullard wanted to cut rates even more by half a percentage point the divergence of opinions on the committee reflect the mixed data coming from the economy observed ben ayers senior economist at nationwide the business sector is struggling with the trade disruptions and has slowed sharply while the state of the consumer remains strong and is driving more spending the most serious threat to the expansion is widely seen as mr trump s trade war the increased import taxes he has imposed on goods from china and europe and the counter tariffs other nations have applied to u s exports have hurt many american companies and scuttled plans for investment and expansion last week the trump administration and beijing acted to de escalate tensions before a new round of trade talks planned for october in washington d c but most analysts foresee no significant agreement emerging this fall in a conflict that is fundamentally over beijing s aggressive drive to supplant america s technological dominance along with managing investor expectations the fed also this week has had to contend with an unusual spike in the rates charged in overnight money markets that banks and corporations depend upon for their daily cash needs on monday and tuesday nights overnight borrowing costs which usually stay close to the fed s benchmark rate surged close to 10 to calm markets the federal reserve bank of new york stepped in injecting more than 53 billion into that corner of the market and following up wednesday morning with another 75 billion it was the first time such an action was taken since the 2008 financial crisis economists believe this week s logjam was caused in part by corporations that need cash on hand to make their quarterly tax payments and rely on overnight lending markets for the funding powell on wednesday called the crunch a result of technical issues adding that they have no implications for the economy or our stance on monetary policies
