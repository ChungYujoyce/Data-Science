this article has been updated to reflect news developments if you re a democrat who doesn t want bernie sanders to be the party s nominee your choice is now clear you should vote for joe biden that s the implication of biden s resounding victory in south carolina and pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar to their credit have both acknowledged this reality by dropping out of the race i realize it was only about a week ago that biden s campaign seemed grievously wounded and he has still won only a single primary so how has he so quickly become the only good alternative to sanders there are four main reasons 1 biden holds a clear lead in the combined popular vote after the four first contests with about 30 percent sanders has 24 percent and buttigieg has 16 percent next come elizabeth warren 10 percent and klobuchar 9 percent biden is first because he won south carolina in a landslide by an even larger margin than sanders won nevada and because south carolina is larger than either iowa or new hampshire in the delegate count sanders holds a small lead over biden with no one else close 2 biden looks much more like a national candidate than any other moderate as well as winning south carolina he finished second in nevada the two states where biden has trailed the other moderates iowa and new hampshire are overwhelmingly white states that don t resemble the rest of america 3 michael bloomberg no longer looks to be as strong a candidate as he did before the debates bloomberg entered the race late which makes it hard to judge his candidacy fully but one of the penalties of entering the race late is that you forfeit some opportunities to win over voters when biden was looking his weakest after new hampshire bloomberg looked as if he might be a better bet than biden today given biden s current lead in the popular vote it s very hard to make an argument that bloomberg is the stronger candidate 4 moderate voters need to make a decision now if they continue to split their votes among multiple candidates they will hand the nomination to sanders this reality clearly shaped buttigieg s and klobuchar s decisions to end their campaigns impressive instances of politicians sublimating their own personal interests amassing delegates and potentially being a convention kingmaker to a larger principle to be clear i understand why many voters prefer sanders over biden i see arguments in favor of each but for democrats who disagree with sanders s agenda or who worry he is a weaker general election candidate there is now only one real alternative biden update i wanted to respond to some of the good comments and questions that readers have posted since we published this newsletter i ve condensed the questions into a few of the most common themes what about warren as regular readers know i have a lot of admiration for warren and have written frequently about her the country needs more politicians passionate principled and detail oriented like her over the past year her campaign attracted an enormous amount of media attention contrary to complaints from some of her supporters of a warrenblackout yet once voting began it became clear that her support was weaker than i and many others expected she has yet to finish in the top two of any contest and she finished behind buttigieg who s since dropped out in all of them her support in those early states looks typical of her nationwide support if she remains your preferred candidate and you want to vote for her then you should by all means do so just know the trade off you re likely sitting out the ultimate decision between sanders and biden maybe you don t have a strong preference between them and you re ok with that isn t it too early to winnow the field yes and no it certainty should be too early the current system with the same four unrepresentative states going first and with voters forced to select only one candidate is madness and should be replaced but it s na ve to pretend that the current system doesn t exist the harsh reality is that if you choose to vote for somebody other than biden or sanders at this point you are probably helping the one of those two whom you like less if you re torn between bloomberg and biden for example and you vote for bloomberg you re helping sanders so how can we fix this system the most important change would be ranked choice voting in that case people could signal their support for say warren by listing her first while also choosing between biden and sanders as the second choice ranked choice voting which several states have adopted in some form allows long shots to emerge without similar front runners being hurt early states will still have disproportionate influence so the order should change in each election cycle two overwhelmingly white states should not go first and more major metropolitan areas should get to vote sooner for more jonathan bernstein bloomberg opinion as for michael bloomberg it s been true from the start and continues to be true that the most likely effect of his campaign is to split the mainstream liberal vote and make sanders the nominee nate cohn the times s polling expert sees buttigieg s exit as good news for biden many stronger buttigieg states like maine colorado and utah all of which vote tuesday were also states where biden was in jeopardy of not hitting 15 percent and thus winning no delegates even if his support breaks evenly good for biden and it might not be even elsewhere buttigieg support is concentrated in affluent areas where it ll break biden megan mcardle i might be too pessimistic about biden s chances it all feels just too close to the emotional roller coaster we nevertrumpers rode back in 2016 when we spun elaborate fantasies about the field narrowing and a champion emerging to take down the orange menace jonathan chait biden was not my first or second or third choice he is endlessly exasperating but he has a quality many of the media elites have failed to see his meandering delivery marred with a stutter that seems to have returned in his old age after he mastered it as a young man nonetheless manages to convey a sincerity and a decency perry bacon jr fivethirtyeight buttigieg might genuinely think that sanders would be a terrible nominee for the democratic party but there is a potential upside for buttigieg in making this decision too at his age buttigieg has four decades to try to become president in leaving the race now he builds good will with democratic party officials broadly and biden in particular if you are not a subscriber to
