just one month ago hillary clinton had amassed a 9 point lead over donald trump in national polls and had an even bigger advantage in several swing states her eventual victory seemed to many to be all but assured and democrats were so confident of winning that a landslide victory even seemed like a possibility but it s all been downhill for clinton from there starting in mid august her leads in both national and swing state polls began to gradually shrink and the events of this past weekend seem to have made her margin narrow even further as trump has been getting some of his best state polls of the entire general election campaign importantly clinton still appears to be narrowly ahead both nationally and in enough states to win but the recent trends have not been good for her and make a remarkably dramatic contrast with where the race appeared to be last month so what s happened why has this race gotten so close all of a sudden matt yglesias offers the big picture point that clinton is simply quite unpopular but that still leaves open the question of why things have changed so quickly inconveniently a month of a campaign is a complex thing with many different events unfolding either concurrently or one after another which makes it difficult to test a clean theory about what s made the difference some combination of all this is most likely responsible for the shift we ve seen due to voters changing their minds and perhaps differences in poll response rates though it s unclear which of these factors is most important what is clear is that a race democrats hoped would be a landslide is now looking more like a nail biter in the weeks following the democratic convention in late july trump s poll standing plummeted this was probably partly because clinton got a convention bounce but another factor was likely trump s high profile attacks on the family of the late capt humayun khan the kahn controversy was heavily covered in the press and earned trump a new round of condemnations from high profile republicans but around august 17 trump decided to make a change he installed a new campaign team he stopped doing constant tv interviews where he d end up putting his foot in his mouth he started doing more traditional and message driven campaign events as the wall street journal s monica langley writes and perhaps most importantly trump has managed to avoid embroiling himself in any major new campaign consuming controversies well until thursday s birther flap which hasn t yet played out in the polls of course he is being graded on a curve here as matt yglesias writes even uneventful trump interviews usually contain several untrue or offensive statements that would shock us if any other politician were involved trump still isn t doing as well as we would expect a generic republican nominee to be doing vox s fundamentals based elections forecast suggests that he should be winning 50 9 percent of the two party vote and he s currently 3 points behind that still trump has generally spent the past month hammering home his critique of clinton rather than being dogged with questions about one offensive statement or another and that could be helping bring some reluctant republicans back into his camp there s also one other big thing that s changed for trump in this time period he finally started spending money on swing state campaign ads until mid august hillary clinton had been spending millions on the airwaves essentially unopposed in every key state but now the trump campaign has been investing millions in ads as well now these ads are only seen by swing state voters so we wouldn t expect them to make a dent in national polls and trump has improved nationally so they re not at the heart of what s going on still they could be making a difference at the margins in his performance in the swing states that will decide the election as trump has been improving his operation clinton has been dogged by a series of negative news stories that could be hurting her to some extent on september 2 the fbi released a report of its findings in its investigation into clinton s emails there wasn t really much news here but it quite understandably led to a new spate of news stories with clinton and fbi in the headlines and considering that the last time clinton sank this badly in the polls was in the weeks after fbi director james comey first announced his findings in early july it seems that when the topic is in the news clinton s poll standing suffers over this same late august early september time period a series of negative sounding stories about the clinton foundation also were published most of these stories didn t seem to amount to very much if you read their details closely but the very fact that a bunch of negative sounding stories about clinton appeared in the news helps create an aura of corruption around her particularly when trump dubs her crooked regardless of the fine details most voters aren t retaining the fine details here also note this these voters know they ve heard clinton is corrupt but aren t sure why https t co yqs4pwt82d pic twitter com t5ky40i7ys meanwhile clinton kept a relatively light campaign schedule in august so she could focus on fundraising instead the side effect though was that she didn t have the opportunity to counterprogram those negative news stories with positive events putting her message out there clinton s decision to lay low in august will be debated for years politico s glenn thrush writes if she wins her summertime fundraising blitz meant to unleash a torrent of anti trump advertising at campaign s end will be regarded as strategic genius lose and her decision is up there with michael dukakis in the tank i find that to be a bit overheated and doubt this made that much of a difference but hey when voters did see a lot of clinton and her message during the week of the democratic convention they did seem to like them well enough so the race had already gotten a good deal closer since mid august but then the events of this past weekend seem to hurt clinton even more though it s not clear which mattered most first was deplorables gate at a fundraiser last friday clinton disparaged half of trump s supporters at a fundraiser as belonging in the basket of deplorables racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamophobic you name it clinton soon gave a semi apology saying that half was too much but reiterating that trump does indeed have many racist supporters meanwhile the trump campaign and much of the media quickly portrayed her remarks as a devastating gaffe akin to mitt romney s 47 percent comments from 2012 afterward things got worse for clinton as she felt faint and had to leave a 9 11 commemoration event on sunday was recorded nearly collapsing while being led into her car and belatedly admitted that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier all this seemed to some to vindicate rumors trump and his allies had been trying to spread about clinton s health for some time and made clinton appear less than fully forthright this is speculative but like brendan nyhan of the upshot i suspect the health news is hurting clinton more than deplorables gate yes the trump campaign has seized on her remark but the clinton team probably has better data and they now seem eager to discuss the topic after the candidate s initial semi apology furthermore the deplorables comment seems like the type of inside baseball campaign story that ordinary voters won t really care about whereas clinton s health is far more striking search data also suggests that people are far far more interested in clinton s health than in the deplorables controversy now it s possible that this sudden swing in the polls is affected somewhat by differential non response rates a phenomenon vox s jeff stein wrote about earlier this year that is to say the news of clinton s illness may have made her supporters less enthusiastic about even answering polls so they d naturally show up less often in the results even after demographic weighting similarly trump supporters may have been disproportionately less likely to respond to polls back in early august when trump was under fire for his attacks on the khan family that could have made clinton s poll leads look artificially large then and a change in clinton supporter response rates could be making the race look unusually tight now as stein wrote andrew gelman and alan abramowitz have compiled evidence showing that what looks like big poll swings can often be explained partly by this effect yet if clinton voters truly are feeling so unenthusiastic about the race that they won t answer phone polls that in itself indicates a major underlying enthusiasm problem her campaign needs to solve furthermore finding creative reasons to dismiss poll results that may not fit with your preconceptions has generally been a bad idea this year as trump s primary rise and brexit have both shown as for whether this is the harbinger of a new normal in the race well we don t really know of course there are still 53 more days until election day and much can happen in that time everything mentioned above happened in just the past month clinton s health could get better or worse trump could avoid more gaffes or start backsliding like he did with birtherism on thursday the media could cover trump more harshly now that it seems more likely he could win the debates could go well or disastrously for either candidate what is clear is that a race democrats briefly thought they had in the bag no longer looks like such a sure thing get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
