for the last two weeks or so i have been trying to stay focused on my work on clarence thomas but all the liberal commentary on the democratic primary has gotten me so irritated that i keep finding myself back on social media posting tweeting commenting and the like so i figured i d bring everything that i ve been saying about the election campaign there here in no particular order and with no effort to be scholarly or scientific just my random observations and musings 1 clintonite mccarthyism according tothe guardian the dossier prepared by opponents of sanders and passed on to the guardian by a source who would only agree to be identified as a democrat alleges that sanders sympathized with the ussr during the cold war because he went on a trip there to visit a twinned city while he was mayor of burlington similar associations with communism in cuba are catalogued alongside a list of quotes about countries ranging from china to nicaragua in a way that supporters regard as bordering on the mccarthyite rather than fairly reflecting his views this is becoming a straight up rerun of the 1948 campaign against henry wallace except that clinton is running well to the right of truman and even in some respects dewey it seems as if clinton is campaigning for the vote of my grandpa nat there s only one problem with this strategy he s been dead fornearly a quarter century as was true of mccarthyism it s not really sanders communism or his socialism that has got today s mccarthyites in the democratic party worried it s actually his liberalism as this article in thetimes makes clear some third party will say this is what the first ad of the general election is going to look like said james carville the longtime clinton adviser envisioning a commercial savaging mr sanders for supporting tax increases and single payer health care once you get the nomination they are not going to play nice a sanders led ticket generates two sets of fears among clinton supporters that other democratic candidates could be linked to his staunchly liberal views particularly his call to raise taxes even on middle class families to help finance his universal health care plan and that more mainstream democrats would have to answer to voters uneasy about what it means to be a european style social democrat raising taxes to pay for popular socialprograms that used to be the bread and butter of the democratic party liberalism now it s socialism and that now it s socialism used to be the bread and butter of republican party revanchism now it s democratic party liberalism 2 clinton s firewall the new line of argument against sanders winning the nomination is thatafrican american voters are clinton s firewall which will engulf the sanders campaign once it heads south there have been god knows how manyarticles making this claim over the last two days celebrating theclintons deep and storied relations with the black community how whatever the clintons policy positions support for mass incarceration welfare reform etc both hillary and billdo the kind of retail and symbolic politics that black voters care most about i ll note in passing but not comment on the patronizing condescension of this position and that we ll see all of this come into play after iowa when the campaign heads to south carolina it could be true but first let s go to the wayback machine and seehow black leaders in south carolina responded in 2008 the last time the clintons worked their magic there black leaders widely criticized mr clinton after he equated the eventual victory of mr obama in the south carolina primary in january to that of the rev jesse jackson in the 1988 caucus a parallel that many took as an effort to diminish mr obama s success in the campaign in an interview with the new york times late thursday mr clyburn 3rd ranking democrat in theushouse of representatives said mr clinton s conduct in this campaign had caused what might be an irreparable breach between mr clinton and an african american constituency that once revered him speaking of jim clyburn and south carolina he was onnbcrecently talking about clinton s firewall in 2016 start listening at 2 30 where he says that if sanders wins by ten points in iowa that firewall could disappear very quickly as it did in 2008 and lo and behold according to a poll released last week support for clinton in south carolina is plummeting back in december clinton had a 36 point lead over sanders as of last week that lead has been cut nearly in half forty seven percent of democratic voters now favor clinton 28 favor sanders that s still a lot ofsupportfor clinton butit s considerably smaller than indecember when she had 67 of the vote now it s true that sanders hasn t gotten those defectors from clinton what seems to have happened is that a significant chunk of her supporters are reconsidering their support sanders s support is nearly what it was in december which could mean many things one possibility is that voters are waiting to see what happens in iowa and new hampshire where sanders is doing well but the most interesting part of the polls is the racial and gender breakdown of the vote clinton is losing a higher percentage of her black supporters than of her white supporters and sanders is making greater gains among women than among men on december 17 this is how the polls looked see the thirteenth page which is labeled page six on january 22 the poll was actually concluded on the 15th this is how the polls looked between december and january we see major drops in support for clinton among all categories of voters butthere s a greater drop among black voters 30 than among white voters 24 drop there s also a virtually identical drop among male 36 and female 34 voters sanders s support among black voters remains practically the same as it was in december he sees a tiny drop among white voters but more interesting is that while he s made gainsamong both male and female voters the gains among women 28 are much greater than among men 13 3 sister souljah moment remember sister souljah in 1992 bill clinton chose to go after her as a signal to white voters that he and the democrats were no longerbeholden to black voters it was a signature moment not only for him but also for the democratic party they weren t going to be the party of quotas welfare and black people which makes the claim that sanders is bad and clinton is great on race all the more galling have we forgotten everything well there s one figure in the united states today who hasn t sister souljah back in november she spoke out against clinton s campaign 4 a little nutty and a little slutty speaking of forgetting everything david brock the man who called anita hill a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty now says black lives don t matter much to bernie sanders brock is described here as a top clinton ally who runs several super pacs aiding her candidacy only in this country could such a charlatan make these sorts of claims and get away with it 5 dissolve the people elect another as sanders surges in the polls in iowa and new hampshire opening up an8 point lead in iowaand a 27 point lead in new hampshire and the pundits and party elites get squirmier and squirmier about his possible victory i m reminded of this line from brecht would it not be easier in that case for thegovernment to dissolve the people and elect another 6 first they came for 7 camera obscura speaking of german writers in the german ideology marx wrote in all ideology men and their circumstances appear upside down as in a camera obscura i was reminded of that quote when i stumbled across this story from the summer back in july while everyone was touting clinton s sensitivity and deftness and sanders insensitivity and tone deafness around issues of mass incarceration and black lives matter this little tidbit was reported in the intercept and completely ignored lobbyists for two major prison companies are serving as top fundraisers for hillary clinton richard sullivan of the lobbying firm capitol counsel is a bundler for the clinton campaign bringing in 44 859 in contributions in a few short months sullivan is also a registered lobbyist for the geo group a company that operates a number of jails including immigrant detention centers for profit as we reported yesterday fully five clinton bundlers work for the lobbying and law firm akin gump strauss hauer feld corrections corporation of america the largest private prison company in america paid akin gump 240 000 in lobbying fees last year the firm also serves as a law firm for the prison giant representing the company in court the geo group in a disclosure statement for its investors notes that its business could be adversely affected by changes in existing criminal or immigration laws crime rates in jurisdictions in which we operate the relaxation of criminal or immigration enforcement efforts leniency in conviction sentencing or deportation practices and the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws or the loosening of immigration laws apparently the new rule of american politics is so long as you say the right thing you can do anything postscript in october clinton was forced to stop working with these clowns from the prison industrial complex and return all the money sanders never had to return a dime because he never took a dime 8 reparations sanders has gotten a lot of heat from the left for saying he s against reparations it s a complicated issue the substance of which i don t want to comment on here instead i ll just note thatin 2008 another presidential candidate was asked about his position on reparations here s what he had to say democratic presidential candidate barack obamaopposes offering reparations to the descendants of slaves putting him at odds with some black groups and leaders the man with a serious chance to become the nation s first black president argues that government should instead combat the legacy of slavery by improving schools health care and the economy for all i have said in the past and i ll repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed the illinoisdemocrat said recently let s not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life said kibibi tyehimba co chair of thenational coalition of blacks for reparations in america in light of the demographics of this country i don t think it s realistic to expect him to do anything other than what he s done but this is not a position obama adopted just for the presidential campaign he voiced the same concerns about reparations during his successful run for the senate in 2004 i pointed this out on twitter to killer mike the rapper who s supporting sanders he retweeted me which may be just about the biggest endorsement on twitter i ve ever gotten except for that time morgan fairchild retweeted me and that time john cusack retweeted me but who s counting 9 the establishment after human rights campaign and planned parenthood endorsed clinton sanderssaid they were part of the establishment clinton and her supporters made a big to do of it but this response from garance franke ruta was the most sublime bernie remarks a reminder how left economics new social movements civil rights women s rights gay rights have always been uneasy allies garance franke ruta thegarance january 20 2016 no not really back in 1985 that old dinosaur of a socialist bernie sanders was signing a gay pride day proclamation on the grounds that gay rights were civil rights back in the 1990s while the clintonswere supporting doma and don t ask don t tell that old dinosaur of a socialist helped lead the opposition tobothpolicies on the grounds that they were anti gay and throughout his career in the senate sanders got consistently higher ratings from civil rights organizations than clinton did while she was a senator the only thing this whole episode is a reminder of is how poorly journalists do their job speaking of the establishment clinton is now claiming that it s sanders who s the establishment while she is i don t know what whatever she calls herself i wonder what she calls this hillary clinton s campaign released a letterthis week in which 10 foreign policy experts criticized her opponent bernie sanders call for closer engagement with iran and said sanders had not thought through these crucial national security issues that can have profound consequences for our security the missive from the clinton campaign was covered widely in the press but what wasn t disclosed in the coverage is that fully half of the former state department officials and ambassadors who signed the letter and who are now backing clinton are now enmeshed in the military contracting establishment which has benefited tremendously from escalating violence around the world particularly in the middle east here are some of the letter signatories current employment positions that were not disclosed in the reporting of the letter 10 savant you ll be hearing a lot in the coming weeks about what a political savant hillary clinton is and what a political naif bernie sanders is you already have on sunday or monday i countedfive such articles alone here s some information to consider when you hear that kind of talk even though the clinton team has sought to convey that it has built a national operation the campaign has invested much of its resources in the feb 1 caucuses in iowa hoping that a victory there could marginalize mr sanders and set mrs clinton on the path to the nomination as much as 90 percent of the campaign s resources are now split between iowa and the brooklyn headquarters according to an estimate provided by a person with direct knowledge of the spending the campaign denied that figure the campaign boasted last june when mrs clinton held her kickoff event on roosevelt island in new york that it had at least one paid staff member in all 50 states but the effort did not last and the staff members were soon let go or reassigned for all its institutional advantages the clinton campaign lags behind the sanders operation in deploying paid staff members for example mr sanders has campaign workers installed in all 11 of the states that vote on super tuesday mrs clinton does not even bill clinton is questioning the strategic wisdom of the clinton campaign bill clinton is getting nervous with polls showing bernie sanders ahead in new hampshire and barely behind if at all in iowa the former president is urging his wife to start looking toward the delegate rich march primaries a shift for an organizing strategy that s been laser focused on the early states bill clinton according to a source with firsthand knowledge of the situation has been phoning campaign manager robby mook almost daily to express concerns about the campaign s organization in the march voting states which includes delegate bonanzas in florida illinois ohio and texas many clinton allies share the president s desire for more organization on the ground they see enthusiasm that s ready to be channeled but no channel yet in place iowa matters a ton but it seems to be the campaign s only focus said one person close to the campaign s operations in a march state one of nearly a dozen clinton allies with whom politicospoke for this article it s going to be a long primary and the campaign seems less prepared for it than they were in 2008 11 we are all socialists now from the great state of iowa little noticed in this week s des moines register bloomberg politics iowa poll was this finding a remarkable 43 percent of likely democratic caucus participants describe themselves as socialists including 58 percent of sanders s supporters and about a third of clinton s and it s not just iowa senator bernie sanders s speech on thursday explaining his democratic socialist ideology carried little risk among supporters and other democrats a solid majority of them have a positive impression of socialism according to anew york times cbs news poll released this month fifty six percent of those democratic primary voters questioned said they felt positive about socialism as a governing philosophy versus 29 percent who took a negative view 12 the gender gap another pundit tropeis that sanders is not popular among women there is a gender gap in this primary in fact but it s not only the one you may have heard about according to the latestusa todaypoll there is a gender gap as well and not the one that favors clinton among baby boomer women men under 35support sanders by 4 percentage points women back himby almost 20 points the possibility of breaking new ground by electing the first female president apparently carries less persuasive power among younger women than their mothers generation stone is ready to support clinton though she prefers sanders he s actually talking about breaking up the big banks and helping income inequality she says and given that i m currently unemployed income inequality is pretty important a fact thatapparently has caught the clinton campaign completely off guard mrs clinton and her team say they always anticipated the race would tighten with campaign manager robby mook telling colleagues last spring that mr sanders would be tough competition yet they were not prepared for mr sanders to become so popular with young people and independents especially women whom mrs clinton views as a key part of her base 13 chelsea mourning chelsea clinton who lives in a gramercy park apartment that she and her husband bought three years ago for 10 5 million says i was curious if i could care about money on some fundamental level and i couldn t reminds me of that old joke one fish asks another how s the water the other replies what the hell is water 14 the immense and shitty hassle of everyday life under capitalism arin dubelaunched an interesting discussion on his facebook page the other day riffing off of a bunch of paul krugman s posts which are fairly critical of sanders healthcare plans arinwonderedwhether sanders focus on single payer after all the drama and struggle over obamacare and its achievements in terms of extended coverage really makes political sense there are excellent arguments on all sides and arin s voice is always one that i listen to but i posted this comment on his page because i have this nagging feeling that a lot of the discussion around healthcare and insurance in the media is missing a critical reality i m posting it less as a definitive statement and more as an opening to see if my own intuitions and experiences track with those of others i recognize that i really could be an outlier here so feel free to tell me that i am i just find it hard to believe that my experience of this system is so completely sui generis anyway here s an edited version of what i said can i speak to this less from the policy or political perspective or more from the individual perspective as a way of getting to the political perspective my family has insurance i get mine from cuny and my wife and daughter get theirs from my wife s employer from what i can gather we have decent insurance yet when i think about the mountains of time i have to spend dealing with health care and insurance the submission of forms the resubmission of forms haggling with the insurance companies to make sure things that should be covered are covered or simply to make sure that forms are being processed at all getting the doctor to revise forms b c the diagnostic or procedure codes may not be correct or may have changed which they do with alarming frequency it seems and the consistent surprises i experience about how much we still have to pay after the deductibles the premiums the co pays the out of networks are accounted for before we even get reimbursed i can t quite believe the statements that are out there about how there s just not a constituency for further reform again we have pretty good insurance we are pretty healthy and don t have out of the ordinary needs we are comparatively well off and highly educated yet there s an inordinate hassle of time and in the end a lot of costs we have to absorb ourselves and a tremendous amount of confusion despite my phd about how those costs get calculated and distributed which i find maddening and expensive am i just that sui generis or is it that the academic and media discourse is so focused on a certain kind of aggregate data that it ignores that there are huge costs that are being shouldered by individuals and that if there were political leadership that could really speak to those costs there might be more of a constituency than we realize what i take sanders to be doing is making these individual costs a public or political problem what i see mostly happening in the discussion is a shuffling off of those costs onto the individual so that they simply disappear from the political calculus it s a classic issue of politics one side a very small side it seems wants to make what is personal and individual into something public and political while another side including it seems a lot of reformers tends to escort those personal and individual experiences off into the shadows what i m saying here doesn t confront i recognize the reality of the institutional intransigence of those who are opposed to reform that s a separate issue but when i hear that obamacare has solved this problem for 90 of the population and i think that my family is up there in the relatively well off sector of that population yet experiences significant costs and burdens that we find very hard to shoulder and understand well i just wonder if we re really seeing this reality whole i was building here on an old theme of mine the immense and shitty hassle of everyday life that is life in contemporary capitalism i wrote about that injacobin a few years ago in the neoliberal utopia all of us are forced to spend an inordinate amount of time keeping track of each and every facet of our economic lives we saw a version of it during the debate on obama s healthcare plan i distinctly remember though now i can t find it one of those healthcare whiz kids maybe it was ezra klein tittering on about the nifty economics and cool visuals of obama s plan how you could go to the web check out the exchange compare this little interstice of one plan with that little interstice of another and how great it all was because it was just so fucking complicated i thought to myself you re either very young or an academic and since i m an academic and could only experience vertigo upon looking at all those blasted graphs and charts i decided whoever it was was very young only someone in their twenties whipsmart enough to master an inordinately complicated law without having to make real use of it could look up at that everest of words and numbers and say yes there s freedom 15 clarence thomas and free speech this has nothing to do with the election but what the hell i did manage when i wasn ttearing my hair out or having an aneurism over the campaign commentary to read a lot ofclarence thomas and secondary work on commercial speech and it struck me in reading all this material that citizens united and campaign finance law may be a massive sideshow to the real drama around money speech that s occurring in conservative jurisprudential circles conservativesaim it seems to use the first amendmentto strike down entire economic regulatory regimes at the state and federal levels on the grounds that so much of commercial life is a mode of speech which should be protected like other modes of speech in one instance they struck down a licensing law in d c that required tour guides to be registered with the city violation of free speech thomas is at the center of this and it s really unclear how far the conservatives on the court will be willing to go it raises some fascinating questions because the connection between money and speech as i m discovering in this excellent dissertation i ve been reading is an old and surprisingly complicated one in political theory in which aristotle and locke play critical roles locke s pamphlet against the devaluation of the pound may have been according to this author the single most influential writing he did up until the 19th century anyway lots going on in this arena which we should all be paying more attention to 16 politics without bannisters there s a lot of fretting both well meaning and cynical out there about whether sanders can win here s the deal people for the last decade and a half we ve been treated to lecture after lecture from on high about how if you want things to change you have to build from below well that process has been going on for some time unlike purists of the left and purists of the center who are the most insufferable purists of all precisely because they think they re not i look at the various fits and starts of the last 15 years from seattle to the nader campaign to the iraq war protests to the dean campaign to the obama campaign to occupy to the various student debt campaigns to black lives matter as part of a continuum where men and women young and old slowly relearn the art of politics whose first rule is if you want x shoot for 1 000x and whose second rule is it s not whether you fail you probably will but how you fail whether you and your comrades are still there afterward to pick up the pieces and learn from your mistakes though i ve not been involved in all these efforts i know from the ones that i have been involved in that people are learning these rules but at some point you have to put that knowledge to the test now the sanders campaign is putting it to the test is it too soon maybe probably i have no idea none of us does but you can t possibly think we got anything decent in this country without men and women before us taking these and far greater risks taking these and far greater gambles sometimes i think americans fear failure in politics not for the obvious and well grounded reasons but because they are well americans that is men and women who live in a capitalist civilization where success is a religious duty and failure a sin where thou shalt succeed is the first commandment and thou shalt not fail the tenth is it not the right time for the sanders campaign the republicans control the congress sanders might lose to trump or whomever we don t have the organizational forces in place yet well re the first two concerns when will that not be the case as for the third well that s a very real concern to me but we won t know in the abstract or on paper we have to see it in action to know right now the voters of iowa and new hampshire are telling the pundits and fetters we are reality deny us at your own peril i m fantasizing a campaign where sanders racks up more and more victories and the pundits get more and more hysterical he can t win he can t win maybe theputative realists for whom reality seems to be more of a fetish or magical incantation ought to listen to them 17 fame oh and did i mention that i got retweeted by killer mike corey robin is a professor of political science at brooklyn college and the cuny graduate center author of the reactionary mind conservatism from edmund
