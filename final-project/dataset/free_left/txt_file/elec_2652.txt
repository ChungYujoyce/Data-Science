player announcing a six ball break and then sinking six hillary clinton all but announced she would bait trump into losing his head during the first presidential debate and then did so sending him into a spiral of self destruction you don t have to like clinton to tip your hat to the achievement or concede that it was a public service that trump was arrogant and insouciant enough to walk into the most important 90 minutes of his campaign unprepared and then spend the following week rehashing it in midnight rants showed every fence sitting voter how dangerous he would be in power a competent performance in debates two and three won t undo the damage nor should it an amateurish debate rehearsal thursday night which trump conducted in front of a live audience of supporters and with a pro trump moderator quickly fell apart when he couldn t keep his rambling answers within the allotted two minutes he left the stage after just half an hour i admit that i ve said it before but the great tragedy of donald trump s nomination isn t that he legitimized bad ideas it s that he discredited good ideas after decades of going full throttle on trade immigration and the projection of military power more and more americans now want to hit pause or stop that trump in voicing such sentiments empowered such americans and left the establishment fanning itself was his great achievement that he poisoned his ideas with his character trafficking in racial provocations cynicism cruelty prevarication bullying narcissism ignorance and impulsivity was his great crime and that was before a video emerged on friday of trump bragging about how he enjoys groping women a revelation that resulted in a lukewarm apology numerous high ranking republicans withdrawing their support and his own v p nominee rebuking him typically trump subsequently noted that he wasn t going anywhere trump s enemies have been his best friend and his best friend donald trump has been his worst enemy because so much of the rage directed trump s way this past year has been instinctual and blind i ve tried to avoid jumping on that train in fact one of the greatest ironies of journalists beating themselves up for failing to prevent trump s rise is that their own hostility fueled it sixty eight percent of americans do not trust the media nor do they trust our elites in general should they so when trump earned himself the enmity and opposition of not just all democrats but also jeb bush bill kristol david brooks rupert murdoch the new york times the washington post michael gerson john boehner mitch mcconnell the wall street journal wall street lindsey graham hank paulson jorge ramos the remaining bushes mitt romney pretty much anyone employed by any university and every new york based periodical without the words observer or post he just looked better and better on the other side of the ledger however was always the candidate himself in interviews at rallies on twitter trump regularly said and did things that were awful and inexplicable trump s enemies have been his best friend and his best friend donald trump has been his worst enemy nowhere did that come out more clearly than on the debate stage it s easy to forget his multiple disastrous outings during the primary season including one in which he vowed to command u s soldiers to commit war crimes reversed himself on immigration policy and boasted about being sexually adequate but trump never learned any lesson he didn t seem later to forget that clinton is having trouble generating enthusiasm for her campaign has become a daily news story even though it isn t new to say nothing of surprising most of us prefer a president who isn t cagey greedy insecure opportunistic artificial defensive entitled trigger happy or unimaginative but sometimes it s good enough for government work last may ted cruz no slouch on baseness in his own right tossed off all muzzle and spoke from the gut about donald trump calling him a pathological liar a bully a serial philanderer a person for whom morality does not exist and a narcissist at a level i don t think this country has ever seen these accusations leave out that trump scams little people gives almost nothing to charity and shows no sense of restraint in the attacks he launches or the hurt he s willing to cause compared to trump s vices clinton s even when married to bad policies and poor judgment fade away this then is the state of affairs as we go into debate two we re a long way from 2008 this week the alt rightish venture wesearchr founded by former business insider c t o pax dickinson and notorious right wing internet warrior charles c johnson now banned from twitter recently released a 20 minute video of barack obama visiting kenya in the early 1990s wesearchr s model one of crowd funded bounties on research is an interesting one as available to the left as it is to the right but that is a separate subject perhaps as wesearchr hopes haters of the president will see something disagreeable in the young obama s thoughts on race identity and africa but the rest of us will probably come away thinking about how much he ll be missed if anything is striking about young obama in the 90s it s how utterly old obama like he already is curious and questioning focused and observant ambivalent and thoughtful about his identity but not insecure and above all decent the current president has revealed plenty of faults and misjudgments and his administration has not been as free of shadiness as some of its fans claim but he has always had scruples when it comes to the most powerful person in the country no quality is more important unfortunately scruples are not guaranteed so our choice now is between clinton who has too few and
