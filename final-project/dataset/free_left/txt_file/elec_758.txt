uptick in political engagement comes as donald trump s presidency has raised the stakes for the american electorate energizing voters on both the left and right as they head to the polls on 6 november against a backdrop of deep rooted polarization to democrats the elections mark the first concrete opportunity to channel the energy that has so far been manifested in marches and protests into action

outcome will determine which party controls congress and has the potential to change the course of trump s presidency 2018 appears to be an election where we re going to have higher than typical midterm turnout said michael mcdonald an associate professor of political science at the university of florida whose research has focused on voter turnout why its name is donald trump noting that both parties were seeing higher levels of engagement mcdonald said midterms were typically a referendum on the president and his party donald trump is part of the story of what s going on the policies that the republicans have enacted are also part of that story according to a pew research center survey 60 of americans said their vote would be an expression of opposition to or support of the president far more respondents by a 14 point margin said they viewed their midterm vote as being against trump democrats need to flip 24 republican seats to take back the majority in the house of representatives for the first time since 2010 the senate map is more favorable to republicans who are hoping to expand on a narrow 51 49 seat majority by toppling several red state democratic incumbents several states signaled they were seeing record numbers of voters registering to cast their ballots in november this month california s secretary of state said 19 million residents had registered to vote an increase of about 1 5 million compared with the 2014 midterms a similar trend was observed in texas where state officials cited an 11 rise in registered voters from the previous

races a record number of people also registered to vote last month on the national voter registration day according to the organization nonprofit vote more than 800 000 people registered on the holiday which was created in 2012 in 2014 just 154 500 people registered to vote it remains to be seen however how many of those who registered will show up at the polls mcdonald said there was not yet enough data from which to draw any sweeping conclusions and that there had been little evidence to suggest the kind of turnout in midterms that the country typically sees when the white house is in play it s still going to be well short of a presidential election it s not that it s going to revolutionize turnout he said politicians celebrities and other public figures have nonetheless escalated their calls on voters to register as deadlines come to a close in states that could prove influential in november underscoring the importance of the moment trump who has ramped up his campaign appearances on behalf of republican candidates implored his supporters on tuesday to register to vote in an all caps tweet celebrities have joined the chorus rihanna shared voter registration

registrations his group had seen were by voters aged 18 to 24 followed by those aged 25 to 29 that is completely inverted from what we saw at the same time in 2016 he said noting in the previous
