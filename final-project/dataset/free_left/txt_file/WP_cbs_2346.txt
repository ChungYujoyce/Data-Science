watch cbsn live april 14 2020 6 40 am ap sacramento california gov gavin newsom said he will reveal plans tuesday for gradually releasing california from the coronavirus restrictions that have kept 40 million residents indoors for much of the last month newsom didn t provide a specific date for rollbacks or other details but said monday the decisions will rely on science and not political pressure that followed assertions by president trump that he is the ultimate decision maker on how and when states will ease restrictions designed to prevent people from congregating to try to slow covid 19 s spread officials around the world have said that social distancing measures and quarantines have made progress in reducing the spread of the virus but they also have warned that easing those measures too soon might lead to a surge while the number of cases continued to rise in california newsom and others have said the feared surge might be smaller than anticipated barely a week ago newsom s administration was forecasting that the state could require up to 66 000 additional hospital beds by mid may but continuing an encouraging trend the governor said the number of people hospitalized in intensive care saw only a modest 2 9 increase on sunday to 1 178 in los angeles county the state s largest and home to about 40 of its virus deaths and overall cases officials said the number of new cases was the lowest in weeks the road ahead while still foggy is becoming clearer los angeles mayor eric garcetti said although he wasn t ready to discuss easing local restrictions until we have a day with no increases and more people are coming out of hospitals than going in we still have our work cut out for us garcetti said state and local economies are suffering as shutdowns of all but essential services have thrown millions of people out of work concerns about restarting some or all of them include avoiding a free for all with neighboring states newsom oregon gov kate brown and washington gov jay inslee on monday announced they were partnering to work out a shared approach for reopening our economies any approach is certain to be cautious and gradual dr jeffrey klausner a professor of medicine and public health at the university of california los angeles said 90 of cases in california are in 14 mostly urban counties he said it would make sense to start lifting restrictions in rural places and see how it goes over periods of about two weeks he suggested newsom could start with opening public spaces shelter at home orders could be lifted next followed by reopening restaurants that don t have intense crowding mr trump however was emphatic monday that the choice to reopen states was up to him alone writing on twitter it is the decision of the president and for many good reasons at a white house briefing he said his administration has a very good relationship with the governors but the federal government has absolute power in that decision making process if it chooses to exercise it newsom and the president have been political enemies clashing about immigration abortion rights and the environment but both have praised the other s response to the coronavirus pandemic newsom said he was confident that cooperation on a road map for recovery will be maintained california has more than 24 000 covid 19 cases and nearly 750 deaths according to a tally by johns hopkins university for most people the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough that clear in two to three weeks for some especially older adults and people with existing health problems it can cause severe life threatening illness including pneumonia while there is improving data overall certain populations remain especially vulnerable they include the
