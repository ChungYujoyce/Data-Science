watch cbsn live by caitlin conant october 25 2019 5 38 pm cbs news former texas congressman beto o rourke said friday that he s open to the idea of letting places such as hunting lodges and gun ranges keep ar 15s and ak 47s despite proposing a mandatory buyback of those weapons perhaps a way to address a legitimate concern or need is to ensure that those who have or want to use an ar 15 are able to keep it at a hunting club or at a gun range so that there is some control o rourke said in response to a student at north high school in des moines the student made a case for using an ar 15 to hunt deer something o rourke said he had not heard before cbs news campaign reporter adam brewstersays o rourke stood by the remarks speaking to reporters after his events at the high school i m open to the idea actually as proposed originally by congressman eric swalwell that in a mandatory buyback there would be places like a gun range or a hunting lodge where you could securely keep an ar 15 or an ak 47 he said when asked if those would be the only venues that could keep the weapons and whether he was beginning to think the proposed mandatory buyback went too far on thursday evening talked
