trump was a gamble it s not paying off a few months ago i had dinner with a friend who argued that it was time to rethink donald trump s presidency after all the economy was fine we hadn t ended up in a nuclear war and the tough posture toward china was paying some trade dividends maybe the madman routine was working maybe it really was just a routine and trump was managing the presidency well enough wasn t it time for critics like me to rethink their most dire warnings wasn t it time to admit we d gotten him wrong there were even then obvious rebuttals and i made some of them the lethal mismanagement of the hurricane maria response for instance but there was a power to the argument the worst hadn t happened didn t that require a reckoning and then the novel coronavirus came and president trump did nothing for week after week month after month we sit still in the void where a plan should be forced to choose between endless lockdown and reckless reopening because the federal government has not charted a middle path instead we wake to presidential tweets demanding the liberation of states and laugh to keep from crying when the most powerful man in the world suggests we study the injection of disinfectants trump has let disaster metastasize into calamity the feared collision of global crisis and presidential recklessness has come and it is not close to over there is a lesson here one of particular consequence in an election year in politics we evaluate leaders on the clearest of metrics what did or didn t happen unemployment rose the bill failed the war began we grasp for certainty and understandably so in a post truth age it is hard enough to discuss reality it is maddening to try to debate hypotheticals but much of any presidency takes place in the murky realm of risk imagine that there are 10 horrible events that could befall the country in a president s term each with a 1 in 40 chance of happening if a president acts in such a way that they all become much likelier say a 1 in 10 chance he may never be blamed for it because none of them may happen or because the one that does falls during his successor s term but in taking calamity from reasonably unlikely to reasonably likely he will have done the country terrible harm the logic works in reverse too a president who assiduously works to reduce risk may never be rewarded for their effort because the outcome will be a calamity that never occurred a disaster we never felt we punish only the most undeniable of failures and routinely miss the most profound successes no one votes for anyone in government on whether they reduce pandemic risk from 0 9 percent to 0 1 percent in a decade says holden karnofsky ceo of the open philanthropy project that may be the most important thing an official does but it s not how they get elected of late i ve been thinking back to 2017 when trump began a war of tweets with north korea the world s most irrational nuclear regime just heard foreign minister of north korea speak at u n trump wrote if he echoes thoughts of little rocket man they won t be around much longer trump s behavior stunned even republican allies sen bob corker r tn then the chair of the foreign relations committee warned that the president was treating his office like a reality show and setting the country on the path to world war iii but world war iii didn t happen trump and kim jong un deescalated they met in person and sent each other what trump later called beautiful letters the fears of the moment dissolved those who warned of catastrophe were dismissed as alarmist but were we alarmist or did trump take the possibility of nuclear war from say 1 in 100 to 1 in 50 moments like this dot trump s presidency his withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal dissolved the only structure holding iran back from the pursuit of nuclear weapons what s followed has been not just a rise in tensions but a rise in bloodshed culminating with trump s decision to do what both president george w bush and president barack obama chose not to do and assassinate iranian military leader qassem soleimani the end of that story is as yet unwritten but possibilities range from trump s gamble paying off to iran triggering a nuclear arms race and perhaps eventually nuclear war in the middle east trump s withdrawal from the paris climate accord alongside his routine dismissals of the nato alliance similarly force us to imagine the future probabilistically in both cases trump says he is simply being a tough negotiator forcing the better deals america deserves in both cases unimaginable calamity may or may not result the verdict will not come by election day we will have to judge the risks trump has shunted onto future generations of the many risks that trump amplified through lack of preparation reckless policymaking or simple inattention a pandemic is the one that came due while he was still president but it is not the only one lurking nor is it somehow a charm against other disasters befalling us moreover the coronavirus itself raises the risk of geopolitical crises of financial crises of disasters both expected and unexpected manifesting trump in his daily rhetoric and erratic mismanagement is placing big dangerous bets but he will not cover the losses if they go wrong it s america and perhaps the world that will pay in both lives and money the federal government s primary job is risk management if that sounds strange to you just follow the money more than 50 percent of the federal budget is devoted directly to social insurance programs like social security medicare or medicaid programs that insure americans against the risks of illness old age and financial disaster another 16 percent goes to defense spending which in theory protects us from the risks posed by other countries and terrorist networks together safety net programs and military spending account for almost three quarters of federal spending the us government is an insurance conglomerate protected by a large standing army but the work doesn t end there dig into the remainder of the budget and you find the government devoting itself to the management of more complex and exotic risks in departments and programs that few americans ever hear about as michael lewis writes in his excellent book the fifth risk risk management suffuses the entire federal bureaucracy in ways that are dizzying to try to appreciate in full some of the risks were easy to imagine a financial crisis a hurricane a terrorist attack most weren t the risk say that some prescription drug proves to be both so addictive and so accessible that each year it kills more americans than were killed in action by the peak of the vietnam war many of the risks that fell into the government s lap felt so remote as to be unreal that a cyberattack left half the country without electricity or that some airborne virus wiped out millions or that economic inequality reached the point where it triggered a violent revolution maybe the least visible risks were of things not happening that with better government might have happened a cure for cancer for instance the only way to manage that much risk effectively is to manage the government effectively but trump has never pretended to do that or to want to do that this can sometimes be mistaken for conservative ideology but it s more properly understood as disinterest trump likes being the protagonist in the international drama that is america he doesn t want to make sure the world s most massive complex and sprawling bureaucracy is well run he has shown little interest in nurturing the parts of the federal government that spend their time worrying about risk his proposed budgets are thick with cuts to those departments his proposed appointees often manifestly incompetent his comments marinated in disrespect for the institution he oversees former new jersey gov chris christie who originally ran trump s transition team relayed to lewis a telling comment trump made about the pre administration planning which he considered a waste of time chris he said you and i are so smart that we can leave the victory party two hours early and do the transition ourselves each day the president of the united states receives the president s daily brief a classified report prepared by us intelligence agencies warning of gathering threats around the globe us intelligence agencies warned trump of the dangers of the novel coronavirus in more than a dozen of these briefings in january and february but trump routinely skips reading the pdb and has at times shown little patience for even the oral summary he takes two or three times per week reported the post two problems build amid this kind of executive impatience first the president is unaware of the nation s constantly evolving risk structure second the bureaucracy he in theory manages receives the constant message that the president doesn t want to be bothered with bad news and does not value the parts of the government that produce it nor the people who force him to face it it is in fact worse than that the way to keep your job is to out loyal everyone else which means you have to tolerate quackery anthony scaramucci who served very briefly as white house head of communications told the financial times you have to flatter him in public and flatter him in private above all you must never make him feel ignorant in march speaking at the centers for disease control and prevention headquarters trump unintentionally revealed how much time his underlings spend praising him and how fully he absorbs their compliments every one of these doctors said how do you know so much about this trump boasted maybe i have a natural ability maybe i should have done that instead of running for president to state the obvious this is not a management style that will lead to complex problems being surfaced and solved in 2014 after the ebola epidemic the obama administration realized the federal government was unprepared for pandemics both natural and engineered and so they built a new team into the national security council the directorate for global health security and biodefense beth cameron was its first leader and she explains that it was designed to ensure not just a constant focus on the threat but a bureaucratic structure and a set of interagency relationships that were constantly being exercised so coordination could happen fast when speed was most needed having that in place is really important cameron says because it s in anticipation of a truly catastrophic or existential threat it is the ability to detect it early and then it s the ability to respond efficiently and to practice that at all levels of government that way when the crisis does come the government knows how to react knows who needs to be in the meetings knows where the power and authority and expertise lie it can focus on responding to the threat rather than building the structure needed to respond to the threat the trump administration dissolved that office in 2018 as part of john bolton s reorganization of the national security council the leader of the team rear adm timothy ziemer was pushed out the decision attracted criticism at the time but the white house defended the call in a world of limited resources you have to pick and choose one administration official told the washington post the administration has never explained how or why it chose to deemphasize pandemic risk nor which threats it decided to prioritize instead so neither trump nor his administration was focused on covid 19 in the early days when it would have mattered most i think that it s possible if we d taken this threat more seriously in mid to late january that we could be in a situation where we are containing coronavirus as opposed to having to suppress it cameron says i don t want to overstate the consequence of that one decision it is possible to imagine an administration that eliminated the office but remained focused through other agencies or processes on pandemic risk but in this case the dissolution of the office reflected the interests of the executive and the evidence is everywhere the administration responded exactly as you d expect an administration that had shuttered its pandemic response operation to act which is to say it mostly did not act when the president stands on top of a table and says this is super important super urgent everyone must do this the government works moderately effectively ron klain who managed the obama administration s ebola response told me that s the best case when the president is standing up and saying i don t want to hear about it i don t want to know about it this doesn t really exist well then you re definitely not going to get effective work from the government in his book the precipice oxford philosopher toby ord considers the manifold ways humanity could die or destroy itself the existential risks he considers asteroids and supervolcanoes stellar explosions and nuclear wars pandemic disease and artificial intelligence surveying the data and building in his own estimates ord concludes that there s a 1 in 6 chance humankind or at least human civilization will be annihilated in the next century among the threats one factor dominates other human beings ord believes there s only a 1 in 1 000 chance that a natural disaster say an asteroid or a supervolcano will wipe humanity from the timeline the likelier outcome is that humanity will annihilate itself either accidentally or deliberately it is the chances of a virus bioengineered for lethality of artificial intelligence that erases us malevolently or casually of nuclear war or runaway climate change rendering earth uninhabitable that drive the risk in ord s view to 1 in 6 ord s estimates are arguable perhaps the true probability is 1 in 12 or 1 in 3 or 1 in 50 but it is not zero and ord is purposely ignoring horrifying outcomes that don t result in humanity s extinction a nuclear war that kills 50 million people does not fit his definition of existential risk nor does a bioweapon that kills 200 million or a violent climate disaster that displaces billions but the chance of any or all of these is inarguably higher trump raises the risk of virtually every threat on ord s list in some cases he does so directly in withdrawing america from the paris climate accord and turning the environmental protection agency over to oil industry executives he has directly increased the risk of runaway climate change in refusing to renew the new start treaty with russia and dissolving the iran nuclear deal he has directly increased the likelihood of nuclear proliferation in dismantling the government infrastructure meant to protect us from biological and natural pandemics he has increased america s vulnerability to pandemics as we are seeing but the most important argument ord makes is this risks even across vastly different spheres are correlated there are forces events and people that simultaneously raise or lower the risk of runaway climate change nuclear war pandemics and reckless ai research the simplest way to raise all of them at once ord suggests would be a great power war take a war between the us and china it would raise the chances of nuclear launches engineered bioweapons and massive cyberattacks and even if it never got to that point the increase in hostilities would impede the cooperation needed to slow or stop climate change or to regulate the development of artificial intelligence and yet increasing hostilities with china has been the hallmark of trump s foreign policy even prior to the coronavirus the us china relationship was at the worst point since the forging of the relationship in 1972 says evan osnos who covers china for the new yorker now the situation is much worse the trump administration s initial response to the coronavirus and the one of which it remains most proud was closing travel to and from china it is possible that policy bought us time but it was time we wasted the coronavirus made its way to the us from europe and the trump administration turned to blaming china the president began calling it the chinese virus his administration stalled a united nations security council resolution on the coronavirus because it didn t pin sufficient blame on china for the virus s origins china has responded in kind suggesting the us military carried the coronavirus into the country and expelling us journalists during a recent interview on fox business trump said of president xi jinping i just right now i don t want to speak to him and threatened to cut off the whole relationship it is important not to pretend the us china relationship is easy nor that china has been itself a good actor amid the coronavirus or even more broadly but we are thinking here in terms of catastrophic risk and it is clear that the deterioration of the us china relationship worsened global pandemic risk ask yourself what would ve happened if we d had more constructive conversations with china over the past few years says sen chris murphy d ct would they have been more willing to share information on coronavirus early i don t know the answer to that question but we created a relationship that was purely antagonistic reasonable people can and do disagree on ideal china strategy but in this case there has been no strategy at all an administration that wanted to confront china successfully would strengthen america s other alliances build us influence in asia reinforce our commitments in europe invest in retaining the world s respect and trust trump has done none of that instead has surrounded himself with professional china antagonists like peter navarro ratcheted up tensions continually and made a hobby out of alienating and unnerving traditional allies now in a moment that demands global cooperation the relationship is in collapse and america s international capital is at a low ebb we increasingly feel caught between a reckless china and a feckless america that no longer seems to care about its allies michael fullilove head of australia s largest think tank told the financial times the rising tensions between the us and china worsen almost every existential or catastrophic threat facing the us coronavirus could have been a warning a signal of how quickly catastrophe can overwhelm us in the absence of cooperation instead it s been used to pump more hostility more enmity more volatility into the most important bilateral relationship in the world that is a political choice trump has made a risk he is running on behalf of future generations i know we talk about trust all the time as the missing ingredient but it matters when it comes to international politics osnos says the big blinking risk is that there is not an assumption on the chinese and the us sides that the other one basically has the same interest which is global stability there is a real feeling that the other one is seeking to hurt in normal times the worst risks we face slip easily from our minds we think of the threats we know the ones we faced the year before and the year before that and the year before that this is called availability bias and it is natural we think more about the dangers we ve seen before than the ones we haven t yet the worst risks are by their nature rare if they came due constantly humanity would be ash as a result we conflate the unlikely and the impossible this pandemic if nothing else should shatter that conflation it is hard to pretend the worst can t happen when you haven t been able to enter a store or see your parents for six weeks and let s be clear coronavirus is not the worst that can happen the h5n1 virus for instance has a mortality rate of 60 percent and scientists have proven that it can mutate to become as easily transmissible as the seasonal flu even scarier is the possibility of human engineered pandemics as bad as the coronavirus is bill gates told me it s not anywhere near bioterrorism smallpox or another pathogen that was intentionally picked for a high fatality rate as well as delayed symptoms and a high infectious rate we play for the highest of stakes we must do what we can to improve our odds no one bears a heavier burden in that respect than the us president but trump is reckless with his charge that reflects perhaps his own life experience he has taken tremendous risks and if they have led him to the edge of ignominy and bankruptcy they have also led him to the presidency but he has always played with other people s money and other people s lives the president was probably in a position to make riskier decisions in life because he was fabulously rich from birth says murphy but it s also true he has had a reputation for risk not backed up by reality his name is on properties he doesn t own we think of him as taking risk in professional life but a lot of what he does is lend his name to buildings with risks taken by others he s built an image as a risk taker but it s not clear how much risk he s taken in electing him president however we have taken a tremendous risk and it isn t paying off right now the trump administration is flailing in its health and economic response to a pandemic ravaging our society the country s chief risk officer failed largely because the country hired someone who didn t want to do that job maybe next time we should hire someone who does support vox s explanatory journalism every
