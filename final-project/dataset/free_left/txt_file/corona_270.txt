advertisement supported by officials in washington state worry that their gains are precarious but they see evidence that containment strategies have lowered the rate of virus transmission by mike baker seattle the seattle area home of the first known coronavirus case in the united states and the place where the virus claimed 37 of its first 50 victims is now seeing evidence that strict containment strategies imposed in the earliest days of the outbreak are beginning to pay off at least for now deaths are not rising as fast as they are in other states dramatic declines in street traffic show that people are staying home hospitals have so far not been overwhelmed and preliminary statistical models provided to public officials in washington state suggest that the spread of the virus has slowed in the seattle area in recent days while each infected person was spreading the virus to an average of 2 7 other people earlier in march that number appears to have dropped with one projection suggesting that it was now down to 1 4 the researchers who are preparing the latest projections led by the institute for disease modeling a private research group in bellevue wash have been watching a variety of data points since the onset of the outbreak they include tens of thousands of coronavirus test results deaths and mobility information including traffic patterns and the movements of anonymous facebook users to estimate the rate at which coronavirus patients are spreading the disease to others the progress is precarious and the data which was still being analyzed and has yet to be published is uncertain officials said that expansive social distancing policies will remain a key part of daily life for weeks to come but the findings offer a measure of hope that the emergency measures that have disrupted life in much of the nation can be effective in slowing the spread of the disease we made a huge impact we slowed the transmission seattle s mayor jenny durkan said in an interview she cautioned that any lifting of restrictions would bring a quick rise in new cases and that she expected distancing requirements to continue in some form for months there is evidence that doing the aggressive measures can have a benefit gov jay inslee said in an interview discussing the overall numbers he is seeing but the governor said that the state was far from turning a corner while there are indications of improvement he said he has also seen numbers in the last few days that still have him worried including a rise in positive test results statewide and the emergence of new cases in rural areas he said more restrictions may yet be needed and that the state is not within 1 000 miles of declaring victory it would be grossly irresponsible to stop these measures now mr inslee said president trump said on sunday that the federal government s guidelines for social distancing would remain in place until april 30 backing down from his previous comments that he hoped the country could go back to work by easter mr trump had clashed with public health experts around the country when he suggested that the guidelines which urge people to stay at home and not to gather in groups of more than 10 might be relaxed by april 12 washington state which enacted some of the nation s earliest and most stringent containment policies has continued to see its death toll climb the state recorded 23 deaths on friday the most in a single day since the outbreak began 16 were in king county which includes seattle all told washington state has had 4 319 confirmed coronavirus cases through sunday the largest outbreak in the country is now in new york which reported 237 deaths on sunday the state s deadliest day so far the number of confirmed cases there jumped by 7 200 reaching 59 513 more than half 33 768 were in new york city where hospitals and the city s 911 system have been overwhelmed i don t think there s any way to look at those numbers gov andrew cuomo of new york said without seeing thousands of people pass away with so many states now deep in crisis the signs of provisional success in the seattle area offer a lesson for other cities and regions that are just beginning to see the onset of the coronavirus early and aggressive action to contain the spread may help lower the trajectory of a virus that could otherwise overwhelm health systems officials in washington state first began to plead with people to keep their distance from one another at the end of february after discovering that the virus had infected people in the seattle area with no known exposure or history of foreign travel followed by an outbreak at a suburban nursing home now linked to dozens of deaths within a week the county was asking organizations to consider postponing large events and for people to work from home if possible people over 60 were encouraged to remain indoors some of the region s major employers including the headquarters campuses of amazon and microsoft responded by encouraging workers to work from home quieting workplace hubs that would otherwise be bustling during commutes and lunchtime the demographics of those workplaces with tens of thousands of tech workers who were able to telecommute may have given the region an early edge in keeping people separated perhaps the city s social norms helped too as local residents have long had a reputation for keeping to themselves or within circles of longtime friends a phenomenon often explained to newcomers as the seattle freeze ms durkan said the region also benefited from a robust network of researchers who were able to do early modeling to assess the reach of the virus in the community without that she said policymakers may not have taken the drastic steps to shut down the city as quickly as they did the region has also benefited from more widespread testing than most states helping feed data to the researchers models and give a sense of how much infection might be missed after scientists found evidence that the virus had been circulating weeks before some of the earliest cases were identified researchers from local groups led by the institute for disease modeling began looking at what it would take to slow the progress of the virus on march 10 they developed projections showing that significant changes in human to human contact would be needed to avert hundreds more deaths by april 8 that projection helped guide a series of actions the next day on march 11 mr inslee banned events of 250 people in three seattle area counties a measure that was soon adopted across the state and by other governors and the seattle public schools announced they would close mr inslee warned at the time how drastically life needed to change saying it was unacceptable for people to be crammed close together at bars and other settings the restrictions he said were going to be profoundly disturbing to a lot of the ways that we live our lives that same day with case numbers also rising in new york mayor bill de blasio was not yet endorsing such limits people should go out and continue to live life should go out to restaurants mr de blasio said over the following days both washington and new york states adopted increasingly stringent restrictions closing schools bars and restaurants and ultimately issuing stay at home orders washington state s coronavirus figures have continued to grow steadily but not as fast as other states the death toll has been doubling about every eight days in washington compared with every two or three days in new york michigan new jersey and louisiana hospitals in washington have yet to be overrun although there are continuing concerns about supply shortages and worries that growing caseloads could still become a problem while the restrictions have apparently helped slow the virus they have devastated businesses in particular restaurants and hotels the space needle is closed pike place market s breezeways are largely barren as in other parts of the country unemployment claims have soared updated may 20 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities ubah dahraan who drives for uber and lyft in seattle said she began seeing business decline in the first week of march well before the major mandates imposed by state and local leaders as city residents started to stay home voluntarily a single mother with three teenagers living in her apartment ms dahraan said the family doesn t go outside now focusing instead on prayer cooking reading and keeping in touch with friends by phone originally from somalia ms dahraan said she hears every day from relatives who are worried about her including those whom ms dahraan has supported financially in the past one said i wish i could help send you money to pay bills this time it s your turn ms dahraan said dr jeff duchin who is health officer for the regional health agency public health seattle and king county said that while the region is seeing positive effects of social distancing measures there are still significant numbers of new cases developing he said the area not only needs to continue the current measures it should also watch to see whether additional containment efforts are needed the threat of a rebound that could overwhelm the health care system remains and will remain for the foreseeable future if we let up too soon dr duchin said many of the seattle area s cases surfaced in the suburb of kirkland at evergreenhealth medical center which has handled some 246 confirmed cases and 47 deaths dr jeff tomlin the medical center s chief executive said on sunday that the number of cases there has remained steady in recent weeks at times when the hospital s intensive care unit has neared capacity he said it has been able to turn to other nearby hospitals for help it would seem for now that it appears manageable but i would be very hesitant to make any predictions dr tomlin said in other parts of the state concerns are still growing dr marty brueggemann the chief medical officer at virginia mason memorial in yakima a city in central washington said his hospital is just starting to see cases arrive while only about 100 cases have been confirmed in the area so far dr brueggemann said he expects that there are thousands more that are undetected and that those who eventually need hospitalization may not reach that point for days yet dr brueggemann projects that in the next two weeks his hospital may find itself without enough ventilators but he said he was encouraged by what he has seen in seattle a lot of us are crossing our fingers and hoping that maybe maybe maybe we ve done some good here dr brueggemann said we re not ready to let our guard down advertisement
