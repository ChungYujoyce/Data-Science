we have looked at the arguments in favor of the republican presidential nomination for former texas governor rick perry wisconsin gov scott walker and sen marco rubio r fla today we look at former florida governor jeb bush there are well known objections the dynasty problem the desire for a new generation of leaders and his problems with the base on immigration and common core but bush certainly has distinctive advantages 1 he is arguably the most knowledgeable candidate on the widest array of issues and cannot credibly be typecast as a dim witted republican being able to discuss many issues intelligently suggests that he would have less of a learning curve if elected and could stand toe to toe with hillary clinton 2 he can converse in spanish and had great appeal among hispanic voters giving him a leg up in colorado nevada and obviously his home state 3 his immigration position turns out to be pretty much where a lot of republicans are border security first fix the legal immigration system and then deal in some responsible way with the 11 million already here that is not amnesty and he s not being bullied into an anti immigrant stance to please a sliver of the electorate on the positive side he has figured out that immigration is part and parcel of a pro growth and optimistic message 4 other than perry bush has the best record of any candidate in the race with conservative accomplishments on taxes education tort reform affirmative action getting rid of it and second amendment rights 5 he is firmly within the conservative hawkish tradition on foreign policy unlike others he didn t muddle his record by opposing airstrikes on syria to enforce the red line or rule out ground troops to fight the islamic state other than rubio there is no one in the race at least not at this stage who is more comfortable discussing foreign policy 6 he demonstrates he can take tough questions and can effectively deal with the media when a campaign does not have to cringe each time the candidate gets asked a hard question it is a good sign 7 while he is of clinton s generation he is far more tech savvy and immersed in the 21st century economy by virtue of his traveling his foundation and his natural curiosity if he was the e mail governor and is conversant on the shared economy globalization and other economic challenges clinton seems stuck in the era of electric typewriters big labor contracts big government and corporate cronyism 8 while he concedes being an introvert and somewhat shy he is also comfortable in his own skin and projects a sense of calm and good cheer he is not a bomb thrower and does not vilify his political opponents one might at least imagine he could work with democrats 9 yes the money and staff matter he will have more than anyone in the gop primary he could raise enough if not to match clinton at least to stay competitive he has made smart hires including david kochel from iowa tim miller for communications and a top flight finance team 10 he has an actual vision and a theme right to rise we will have to see whether he can fill in specifics but a message aimed at upward mobility and domestic reform gives republicans their best shot against clinton receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
