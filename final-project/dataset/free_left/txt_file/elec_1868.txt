 2016 it was supposed to be the state where hillary clinton exposed the limits of bernie sanders appeal instead she s scrambling to eke out a victory by annie karni 02 20 2016 08 27 am est hillary clinton must meet expectations in nevada on saturday ap photo las vegas what happens in vegas doesn t stay in vegas nevada was the racially diverse state where hillary clinton was expected to demonstrate that bernie sanders was a one trick pony popular in largely white states like iowa and new hampshire but unable to compete in parts of the country with large latino african american and asian american populations advertisement now clinton s allies and campaign operatives are bracing themselves for a potential loss here saturday and resigning themselves to a best case scenario in which the wounded frontrunner ekes out a slim but far from decisive victory either way they re aware that the inability to put sanders away here will resonate beyond the state s borders i don t wake up mad at anybody though i will say in the last few days that premise has been challenged just a little a frustrated bill clinton told a crowd of about 2 000 supporters at the final campaign rally friday night in las vegas the crumbling of hillary clinton s nevada firewall piled on top of a stunning blowout in new hampshire last week has created an unsettling moment for the clinton campaign short of delivering a standout performance saturday the campaign that once claimed there was no single must win state on the calendar will face a do or die moment in seven days the feb 27 south carolina primary they understood in recent weeks that nevada was not what they hoped it would be and they need it to be a big double digit win in south carolina a veteran of clinton s 2008 campaign said of the primary in a state where democratic electorate is expected to be almost 60 percent african american otherwise their entire theory of the race goes up in smoke and their ability to raise money goes up in smoke 2016 by steven shepard some of clinton s donors are already expressing concern that the former secretary of state didn t learn anything from her 2008 loss and have been suggesting that the campaign headquarters in brooklyn needs new more senior leadership to help get her back on track sources in the donor world said even surrogates like actress eva longoria have started to voice their frustrations about clinton s inability to connect to voters in the same manner as sanders at clinton s final rally of the campaign friday night longoria mocked voters who say they are not inspired by clinton if hillary doesn t inspire you she said you re not paying attention it s becoming a familiar theme expectations sky high descending numbers and an ouch at the end marist pollster lee miringoff said of the trajectory of the nevada race unless there s a decisive victory it speaks to her weaknesses if you think you re the frontrunner and you re going to be the nominee at some point you have to start stringing together some wins but the real question facing clinton s campaign is whether the results of the caucus here will affect south carolina or the dynamics of the march states which have become the latest goal post since the new hampshire loss the campaign has focused almost exclusively on appealing to african american voters hammering home the idea that sanders simply has no record on issues they care about earlier this week in harlem clinton delivered a weighty speech about racism in america after meeting with civil rights leaders on friday the campaign announced the endorsement of influential south carolina rep james clyburn and unveiled a new television commercial that will air there narrated by prominent african american actor morgan freeman while bill and hillary clinton determined to win here spent the days leading up to the caucus furiously working the employee cafeterias of casinos along the las vegas strip hunting for votes the campaign recognized the looming pressures and turned its attention to maintaining its 18 point lead in south carolina 2016 by marc caputo there older african american voters are expected to do for the wounded front runner what white millennials did for sanders in new hampshire clinton is winning african americans over the age of 45 by about 60 percentage points even if sanders manages to win some support from black voters here clinton allies do not expect it will provide him with enough momentum to make major inroads in a state where the democratic electorate is expected to be almost 60 percent african american the most worrisome issue for clinton operatives is not a loss here but that the nevada results could further fuel sanders fundraising giving him endless resources to flood television markets in the states where clinton is counting on a strong ground organization to win they ve already begun to do things they didn t want to do like bring the super pacs in to spend millions in the primary process said sanders senior adviser tad devine who said a strong showing in nevada will allow them to expand the map of where they think they can win if we do well with nevada latinos and bring out young people if first time voters come out if we win those lower income voters well then you suddenly this coalition of supporters is getting bigger michigan is a place where we can really battle for african american support even missouri you can start to see how we could build a winning coalition but clinton stalwarts still maintain there is no path to the nomination for sanders put the big boy pants on this is going to be a long campaign said tom nides a deputy secretary of state under clinton who remains a trusted adviser dismissing any panic over the nevada outcome the clinton campaign is well aware of that bernie sanders has very little minority support and he has no superdelegate support barack obama had all of that that s what people are forgetting missing
