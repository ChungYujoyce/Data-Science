 opinion fourth estate who knows if the president is really taking hydroxychloroquine but the media is definitely taking the bait ap photo evan vucci by jack shafer 05 19 2020 03 09 pm edt link copied jack shafer is politico s senior media writer you don t need subscribe to the notion that president donald trump is crazy like a fox to concede that his monday disclosure about taking hydroxychloroquine was a decoy move designed to deflect public and press attention from his firing of the state department inspector general which broke over the weekend while the admission makes trump look as scientifically minded as an unsegmented worm hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to be safe or effective in the treatment or prevention of covid 19 the attention generated was worth it like swapping a pawn for a bishop the hydroxychloroquine confession didn t displace the ig story from the news but it wasn t expected to both the new york times and washington post made trump s dreams come true by putting the story on page one of their tuesday editions times president says he takes drug deemed a risk post trump says he s taking unproven medication and after being featured on monday cable news the talking heads were still gabbing about it on tuesday afternoon as he hyped the drug anew during a press spray monday evening the white house added some frosting to the hydroxychloroquine cake by releasing a note from the president s physician that went on and on about the drug but didn t actually claim that he had prescribed it to trump or that trump was even taking it there would be fewer questions about trump and hydroxychloroquine if the white house had released no note at all advertisement stirring intrigue by saying outrageous things has been the key to trump s public relations strategies since he first started shoving himself into the faces of reporters as a young real estate operator he craves attention or what he likes to call ratings and has a knack for knowing what bait to use to hook reporters as the transcript shows trump volunteered completely unprompted the news that he was taking the drug and appeared to enjoy the startled reaction from reporters trump i happen to be taking it reporter hydroxychloroquine trump i m taking it hydroxychloroquine reporter right now trump right now yeah not only was the revelation unprompted it was premeditated as trump confessed later in the discussion i was just waiting to see your eyes light up when i said this when i announced this he said with all the self gratification of a singer who had hit an unexpected high note some people may think trump is a little crazy for taking an unproven drug that can cause heart problems some may think that he s a little irresponsible for encouraging by his actions and words others to expose themselves to a medical risk that offers little chance of a payoff but trump doesn t think like that every moment we spend worrying about the damage trump might be doing to himself or the damage our gullible friends family and neighbors might be doing to themselves by following his lead is a moment we won t be spending on the ig firing or trump s wretched management of the pandemic as former trump adviser steve bannon once told michael lewis the real opposition is the media and the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit by filling the airwaves and the press with discussions of hydroxychloroquine trump has filled the commode to the point of overflowing i d like to think that calling attention to trump s decoy move might reduce its effectiveness but i d be wrong in trump s book any mention neutral praiseful or critical is a win because it takes our eye off of what really matters when it comes to obvious trump provocations like self dosing of hydroxychloroquine the only way to blunt such media manipulation is to ignore him as much as possible do your part flush trump s crap from public mention trump s crap would be a good name for a book about his white house years send book title ideas to emailprotected my email alerts and my twitter feed crave your attention my rss feed can t flush because the vandals took the handle link copied 2020 politico llc
