advertisement supported by the world s greatest con artist has finally come up against a foe he can t fool by maureen dowd opinion columnist washington this is not a good time for vampires or bats which is disorienting for me because as a lifelong aficionado of vampires i have a big collection of bat t shirts victorian bat pins and vampire books and movies once the imagery was hot batman with his bat signal brad pitt and tom cruise slinking around new orleans in interview with the vampire sookie stackhouse from true blood naked and drenched in blood on the cover of rolling stone the kristen stewart and robert pattinson sensation in twilight their broken romance was a favorite subject of donald trump s early tweets but now the bat is a global villain sparking memes like whoever said one person can t change the world never ate an undercooked bat and rants like bill maher s denunciation of chinese wet markets because eating bats is batty vampires were conjured centuries ago in part as a response to plagues passed from animals to humans when the afflicted turned to the supernatural to explain the many terrors according to trump biographer michael d antonio the president s own grandfather friedrich a german immigrant might have died of the spanish flu contracted as he walked around queens looking for real estate properties in 1918 many struck by the coronavirus describe the awful sensation of the virus receding during the day only to viciously strike once the sun sets as chris cuomo put it the beast comes at night the metaphor is also cropping up as members of the trump dynasty are exposed as leeches a podcast by the daily beast this week was titled jared kushner our first android vampire president david axelrod wrote a times op ed with david plouffe advising joe biden whom they dubbed the man in the basement to juice up his campaign trump is like a vampire axelrod told me adding a salty expletive you ve got to drive a stake right through his heart he s going to keep coming there s nothing he won t do even in this environment you can t count on him losing now the monstrous virus has invaded the oval office both the president s valet and a pence staffer katie miller the wife of the racist stephen miller who looks like he hasn t seen daylight in decades have succumbed yet just a few days ago axios reported that the president and some top aides were questioning the high death toll trump has always been fixated on numbers and perfectly willing to fake them his billions his inaugural crowd even the number of stories in trump tower and he knows the number of dead now surpassing 77 500 could be the death knell of his campaign so he is despicably turning the dead into the undead trying to figure out how to claim they weren t lost his talent as an escape artist has run out because he s up against an even more amoral vicious enemy microbes don t give a damn about trump s fake narrative and suppression of the facts when the new trump press secretary kayleigh mcenany was asked friday what the plan was for reopening she replied that we must trust the president to open safely because he is relying on the data risible trump is too much of a fake tough guy to wear a mask and mike pence is too much of a sycophant to the fake tough guy to wear a mask it was apt that as the maskless trump toured a honeywell factory making masks in arizona guns n roses cover of live and let die was playing trump s unmoored assertions add up to a horror story from his failure on testing to his advice to inject bleach to encouraging rowdy protesters and impatient states to liberate from the government s own guidelines to perpetrating the suicidal idea that we have to choose between public health and the economy when they are the same thing when mike pompeo tried to push the 2020 re election line demonizing china saying there is enormous evidence that the virus escaped from a lab in wuhan even intelligence and senior officials pushed back the man who is trusted to lead america beyond the plague anthony fauci dismissed it reiterating with near certainty that the virus originated with a bat and jumped species trump has sidelined the nonpareil fauci and no doubt consumed with jealousy and irritated by his honesty would like to get rid of him he barred the n i h scientist from testifying before the house this month because the committee has every trump hater who want our situation to be unsuccessful which means death wallowing in petty insults vindictiveness and p r piffle even in such a tragic season the president tried to shut down the pandemic task force as the pandemic is still ravaging the country until alarmed associates intervened the white house scuppered the safety guidelines the c d c wanted to put out for fear they would crimp the reopening trump has been leaning into his son in law the pallid nonentity jared is like renfield the zoophagous maniac in bram stoker s dracula who eats flies and death s head moths and does the vampire king s bidding for two of the most urgent missions in american history hunting for supplies and a vaccine the president who is always accusing joe biden of nepotism relied on nepotism and favoritism as the times reported the other day jared bollixed up the desperate search for masks gloves and ventilators this spring heading a group of volunteers that prioritized tips from those with trump connections putting them on a vip list like a lead on n95 masks from a former apprentice contestant who runs women for trump d antonio says that trump was always preoccupied with death when he was young he was convinced he would die before 40 the early death of his alcoholic older brother fred was his formative experience he regards every loss or humiliation as a small death trump s campaign manager brad parscale compared their 2020 bid to the death star parscale also modeled a trump pence keep america great mask on twitter a pandemic is most important a branding opportunity one of trump s favorite songs is the morbid peggy lee ballad is that all there is yet now that it is his duty to lead us out of the valley of death trump appears removed shirking responsibility and deflecting blame he s the world s worst empath as the president tries to prematurely yank the country back to work he seems less focused on the real suffering than reviving his precious stock market
