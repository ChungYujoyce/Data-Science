please read our updated privacy notice and terms of use effective on december 19 2019 by this time next week this will be official joe biden is making his third race for the presidency earlier runs were in 1988 and 2008 in conventional terms he begins his campaign as the front runner or at worst the co front runner with fellow mid septuagenarian bernie sanders he has led in 36 of the 37 polls included in realclearpolitics compilation of 2020 democratic nomination contest surveys he also leads in all the publicly available polls of iowa and even leads in kamala harris s california but the big question haunting his candidacy now is whether he s lost a precious political resource he had not so very long ago the ability to unite his party across ideological and demographic lines precisely because of his age and long party service concluding with his two terms as vice president under the very popular among democratic voters anyway barack obama biden went into the cycle as a sort of intraparty coalition of national salvation option who could serve as a bridge between the clinton obama era of democratic politics and the presumably more progressive future indeed talk in biden s camp about a possible one term presidency seemed to promote this sense that uncle joe wouldn t undermine the winds of change in the party but was instead an emergency candidate for the emergency conditions of the trump era after months of constant reminders however of biden s long history of association with some of the less defensible political and policy trends of the democratic party of the past particularly those in poor repute among those representing the minority and feminist constituencies that are now central to the party s activist and rank and file base alike he s looking less like a revered senior figure and more like the north end of a southbound dinosaur the fact that his reputation for insensitivity has been reinforced by allegations of much more recent inappropriate behavior toward women has given doubts about biden a more urgent currency but at this stage that s mostly from the perception of progressive elites not the people who will vote in next year s caucuses and primaries biden s standing in the horse race polls has remained steady during the winter and spring of activist media discontent with the former veep morning consult s tracking poll of democrats currently gives him a sparkling approval ratio of 75 15 perhaps even more significantly the same poll shows him as the top second place choice of those whose favorite is kamala harris beto o rourke or bernie sanders based on that data he looks like a fine potential unity candidate but it s hard to know if that will last particularly if and when his rivals start throwing some of the punches at him that have largely been confined to media elites and political twitter so far imagine a sound bite version of this argument from my colleague rebecca traister in the voice of a candidate during a debate or in a tv ad s o much of whatisterrifying and dangerous about this time the trump administration the ever more aggressive erosion of voting and reproductive rights the crisis in criminal justice and yawning economic chasm between the rich and everyone else are in fact problems that can in part be laid at the feet of joe biden himself and the guys we ve regularly been assured are democrats only answer biden s standing as a unity candidate could also be undermined by his own efforts if he finds it necessary down the road to distinguish himself from more progressive candidates as representing a moderate tradition and even if chooses instead to accommodate himself to a more self consciously progressive electorate than the one that found him lacking in 1988 and 2008 he could be in danger of falling between stools as ross douthat recently observed it is easy to imagine biden running a campaign that ends up feeling like an apology tour in which he talks endlessly about how much he haslearnedandgrownsince the days when he was a tough on crime democrat who opposed school busing and sometimes voted for late term abortion limits some of the ideas apparently bandied about by his aides a one term pledge stacey abrams as a running mate fit with this strategy in which the goal would be to establish biden as a temporary bridge to a woker future a candidate ready to put his moderate past behind him and serve the new liberal consensus douthat concludes that this kind of biden campaign would probably lose i know this is harsh as badly as jeb bush did you don t have to share that opinion to wonder if biden can pull off the requisite balancing act as his past record becomes a big deal to actual voters it s also possible that biden could restore his unity candidate persona not via any particular accommodation with his past or his party s future but by clearly establishing himself as the most better yet the only electable opponent for donald trump the feasibility of an all electability rationale for biden may depend on your assessment of the much discussed hypothesis that this native of scranton has a unique ability to appeal to white working class swing voters in the very rust belt states that barack obama won and hillary clinton lost it s very early for general election trial heats to have any significance and partisan polarization may eventually erase any differences among democrats but at present biden is doing better than any other democrat when matched against the incumbent if as i ve argued may well happen trump s looking strong enough to produce a full scale electability panic among democrats next year this is an advantage if it holds that would cover a lot of biden s perceived sins he may well need it he s a well known lover of the truth for loeffler a lot of damage has already been done the justice department notified three senators on tuesday that it will not pursue insider trading charges against them after an investigation into stock transactions from the early days of the coronavirus pandemic did not find sufficient evidence they had broken the law according to a person briefed on the investigations the department contacted lawyers for senators kelly loeffler republican of georgia james inhofe republican of oklahoma and dianne feinstein democrat of california all threehad sold substantial amounts of stockin late january or early february when lawmakers were being briefed on the novel coronavirus threat but before the pandemic began roiling financial markets or was fully understood by the public law enforcement officials appear to still be investigating senator richard m burr republican of north carolina whose own mid february stock sales have drawn scrutiny from the justice department and securities and exchange commission last week f b i agentsseized mr burr s cellphone good news out of new york katie miller the highest profile trump administration member to have contracted coronavirus is doing better a real sign of the times georgia s governor bids for the rnc amid talk that charlotte might not host after all there needs to be something for democrats to panic about and right now this is it in early april jason furman a top economist in the obama administration and now a professor at harvard was speaking via zoom to a large bipartisan group of top officials from both parties the economy had just been shut down unemployment was spiking and some policymakers were predicting an era worse than the great depression the economic carnage seemed likely to doom president donald trump s chances at reelection furman tapped to give the opening presentation looked into his screen of poorly lit boxes of frightened wonks and made a startling claim we are about to see the best economic data we ve seen in the history of this country he said the former cabinet secretaries and federal reserve chairs in the zoom boxes were confused though some of the republicans may have been newly relieved and some of the democrats suddenly concerned everyone looked puzzled and thought i had misspoken furman said in an interview instead of forecasting a prolonged depression level economic catastrophe furman laid out a detailed case for why the months preceding the november election could offer trump the chance to brag truthfully about the most explosive monthly employment numbers and gdp growth ever risk public health or else president donald trump on monday morning threatened to move august s republican national convention out of north carolina unless there are guarantees the state will let everyone attend i love the great state of north carolina so much so that i insisted on having the republican national convention in charlotte at the end of august unfortunately democrat governor roycoopernc is still in shutdown mood unable to guarantee that by august we will be allowed full attendance in the arena he began in a string of four tweets the rncis scheduled to be held in charlotte on aug 24 27 less than a week after democrats are set to wrap up their rescheduled convention in milwaukee it s not clear where the republican convention might be moved or how easily that could be done on relatively short notice and this is only part of why the way too late european travel ban was a complete disaster the europe restrictions followed six weeks later but unleashed chaos in ways that surpassed even that of the muslim ban current and former officials said key agencies including the departments of homeland security and transportation had no meaningful input in the nature of the europe restrictions or how and when they would be executed an administration official said officials from both agencies were present at meetings where the ban was discussed the administration scrambled to round up contractors to conduct temperature checks on tens of thousands of passengers officials said the magnitude of the mobilization was unprecedented even so the contractors were overrun by the rush of travelers that trump had helped unleash even the most basic screening steps seemed to backfire the cdc failed to distribute a new paper questionnaire in time for it to be shared with airlines in advance meaning passengers had to fill it out upon arrival as a result travelers found themselves reaching around one another for slips of paper and pencils
