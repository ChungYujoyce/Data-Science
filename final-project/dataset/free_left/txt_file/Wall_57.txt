advertisement supported by the wife of secretary of state mike pompeo is at the center of an investigation into whether a state department employee was assigned to do household tasks by lara jakes washington susan pompeo the wife of america s top diplomat said in an interview last year that she could handle the criticism that came with taking a high profile role at the state department if so the last few days have surely tested her mettle mrs pompeo is now under scrutiny after the firing of the state department s inspector general at her husband s behest it is an uninvited turn for a woman who has long appeared to relish the relationships and perks of being a politician s wife and who has been far more vibrant in the limelight than secretary of state mike pompeo the other half of a down to earth power couple as they have been called in their home state of kansas our whole family teases him about being a diplomat mrs pompeo said in february warming up the crowd at the annual conservative political action conference outside of washington before mr pompeo took the stage he always says to them that he s delivering diplomacy with a little bit of a twist so less cocktail party banter and more straightforward talk by many accounts it is mrs pompeo who is better skilled at the kind of personable engagement expected of diplomats and politicians alike a gregarious chatty foil to her husband s stern public demeanor mike michaelis who hired susan pompeo in the 1980s to work at emprise bank in wichita kan where she later met her husband described her as very smart able to get in front of people and be very articulate susan is a perfect mate for him and would be a perfect mate for anybody that s in the public eye in public office she is warm and people that meet her like her immediately mr michaelis said in an interview at the state department mrs pompeo has traveled with her husband on diplomatic trips far more frequently than most spouses of past secretaries of state she uses the travel in part to meet with families of diplomats posted overseas often acting as an unofficial advocate for the safety and comfort of those who accompany government employees posted abroad a mission common to the spouses of senior government officials mrs pompeo took on similar unofficial responsibilities at the c i a when mr pompeo was the director of the spy agency in 2017 and early 2018 but at both agencies her frequent travel gave way to questions about her conduct diplomats have complained of having to tend to mrs pompeo s needs when she is overseas including keeping her on schedule when she is eager to explore europe s ancient churches or bazaars in the middle east a whistle blower tipped off democrats in congress that mrs pompeo had her own security guards and that agents with the diplomatic security service had been tasked with running errands for the family like picking up takeout food and collecting the family dog from a groomer mrs pompeo s security code name shocker according to cnn is the name of the athletic teams at her alma mater wichita state university where she was named homecoming queen before graduating in 1979 before he was fired friday the state department s inspector general steve a linick was examining among other issues the potential misuse of an aide to do personal errands for both pompeos according to congressional democrats on monday president trump said he had never heard of mr linick but fired him after i was asked by the state department by mike mr trump ridiculed the investigation into whether taxpayer funds were spent for a government official s personal gain in this case according to democratic officials the salary of a staff member who was picking up the pompeos dry cleaning making their restaurant reservations and walking the dog i would rather have him on the phone with some world leader than have him wash dishes because maybe his wife isn t there mr trump said in mr pompeo s defense state department press officers did not respond to a request to interview mrs pompeo the identity of the aide was not clear and department press officers refused to provide it when mr pompeo was a republican congressman representing a kansas district he and mrs pompeo asked staff members in his washington office to perform tasks that included picking up dry cleaning making restaurant reservations and compiling christmas card lists according to people with knowledge of the events however the boundaries between personal and professional activities for members of congress are often blurred and some of the tasks straddled that line representative tom malinowski democrat of new jersey and a former assistant secretary of state for human rights during the obama administration said he was unaware of any other senior state department officials current or former who asked aides to perform tasks that would reasonably be defined as household chores he said he did not know of clear cut department rules that outlined what might be considered inappropriate and acknowledged that past secretaries of state relied on staff members to carry their bags or make dinner reservations when traveling overseas that kind of help tends to stop on your front door in washington d c said mr malinowski before he ruled out running for the u s senate this year mr pompeo s frequent travels to kansas attracted the anger of senator bob menendez of new jersey the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee who questioned whether the secretary of state was improperly playing politics when he was supposed to be working as a diplomat friends in wichita say mrs pompeo with her natural vivaciousness and network of friends and business contacts helped first propel mr pompeo into politics she s like a magnet people are attracted to her said lynn stephan who first met mrs pompeo more than 30 years ago through the wichita state university alumni association she had a huge rolodex and it probably did help his original election a lot but they say they are also careful to not cross the pompeos fearing retribution in the small southeast kansan city mrs pompeo remains politically active in kansas and recently endorsed a republican challenger in a three way house primary to unseat the incumbent democrat sharice davids people in wichita and washington who have watched the couple believe mrs pompeo s political ambition for her husband s future may exceed even his own she has schooled mr pompeo on his public presentations including giving him a failing grade for his 2015 grilling of then secretary of state hillary clinton during a house hearing on the deaths of four american officials in benghazi libya i gave myself a c mr pompeo said later she plays up his tastes in music and movies mr pompeo is a fan of the rock band queen we saw bohemian rhapsody the first weekend she told sean spicer the former white house press secretary on a february 2019 interview on extra and as she put it in a washington times interview last year mrs pompeo urges her husband to stop and smell a rose or two maybe if i m along on state department trips it is not clear how much mrs pompeo s travels with the state department have cost taxpayers or whether she has been reimbursing the government as she did for similar trips with the c i a press officers for the state department would not provide information this week about who accompanies mr pompeo on official business and what costs they may incur what is clear however is that mr pompeo is not likely to bow to criticism over the role of his wife whom he described as a force multiplier in their self described joint mission at the state department and beyond we ve been great partners he said in an interview in kansas last year in everything that we ve done together edward wong and julian e barnes contributed reporting advertisement
