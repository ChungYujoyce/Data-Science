on this face the nation broadcast moderated by margaret brennan clickhereto browse full transcripts of face the nation margaret brennan i m margaret brennan in washington and this week on face the nation the pomp and pageantry of the opening act of the senate impeachment trial of president trump are complete the cast is set as prosecutors defenders jurors and judge prepare for their roles in what is only the third impeachment trial in american history but the question of whether there will be witnesses in the trial and who the witnesses might be will likely be delayed until act one is over it was an unusually subdued senate as the gravity of a presidential impeachment trial set in last week man hear ye hear ye hear ye all persons are commanded to keep silent on pain of imprisonment john roberts do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial you will do impartial justice according to the constitution margaret brennan ceremony over political posturing is well underway house impeachment managers the prosecutors will open their case early this week it s a now familiar one charging with the president with abuse of power and obstruction of congress jerry nadler there is an overwhelming case beyond any reasonable doubt the president betrayed the country margaret brennan the defense team led by white house counsel pat cipollone and trump attorney jay sekulow has some new recruits including high profile celebrity defender alan dershowitz and former clinton prosecutor ken starr they say the house passed articles of impeachment are constitutionally invalid and that the effort is a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the 2016 election and interfere with 2020 we ll preview the senate trial with a top house prosecutor judiciary chairman jerry nadler and texas republican senator john cornyn we ll also look into the impact of the new revelations from rudy giuliani associate lev parnas he is under indictment for campaign finance charges but is implicating the president directly in efforts to push ukraine into investigating hunter biden lev parnas president trump knew exactly what was going on margaret brennan then former white house economic adviser gary cohn joins us for a rare interview weighing in on president trump s economic record and what 2020 democrats should be talking about when it comes to the economy all that and more is just ahead on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation we begin this morning with house impeachment manager and judiciary committee chairman jerry nadler he joins us from new york mister chairman good morning to you representative jerry nadler d new york repjerrynadler judiciary committee chairman good morning margaret brennan well the the white house legal team sent their response last night to the articles of impeachment abuse of power obstruction of justice they on the first argue that there was no violation of any law and on the second point they argue that the president had the right to refuse to produce documents and witnesses due to executive privilege how are you going to prosecute this case representative jerry nadler well both of those statements are arrant nonsense there is ample evidence overwhelming evidence any jury would convict in in three minutes flat that the president betrayed his country by breaking the law the gao the general accountability office just came out this week and pointed out that withholding money from from ukraine that congress had appropriated is against the law but we didn t need them to tell us that and the reason he did that was in order to extort a foreign government to to to smear his political opponents for his personal benefits and to help try to rig the 2020 election as he worked with the russians to try to rig the 2016 election same pattern so there is no question that working with a foreign working with a foreign power trying to extort a foreign power to interfere in our election is about as bad as as you can imagine the main fear the framers of the constitution had why they put the impeachment clause in the constitution was they were afraid of foreign interference in in our domestic affairs margaret brennan mm hm representative jerry nadler the the second thing they say that he broke no law is absurd abuse of power is the central reason for the impeachment clause in the constitution it s all over the federalist papers it s all over the debates in the constitutional convention there is no question about it margaret brennan well representative jerry nadler and the evidence is overwhelming margaret brennan well i i i want to ask representative jerry nadler and the and the last thing they said is is margaret brennan yes representative jerry nadler is that is that the president is entitled to withhold documents no he s not the house of representatives has the impeachment power under the constitution and that includes margaret brennan yeah representative jerry nadler and the supreme court ruled that in the nixon case that he has every that we must demand documents he he can t withhold all the evidence and by the way and then say there s not enough evidence margaret brennan okay well on the question of witnesses from what we are hearing from senate republicans there will eventually be a vote on whether or not to hear from witnesses not a commitment upfront but an agreement to talk about it and vote on it later is there any circumstance in which democrats would consider for reciprocity having hunter biden come and testify representative jerry nadler you know the question of witnesses in any trial in any trial all relevant witnesses must be heard whether if if you re accused of robbing a bank test testimony that i saw him rob the bank or he was somewhere else he couldn t have robbed the bank is admissible it s not negotiable whether you have witnesses and this whole controversy about whether there should be witnesses is just is really a question of does the senate want to have a fair trial or do they or are they part of the cover up of the president any republican senator who says there should be no witnesses or even that witnesses should be negotiated is part of the cover up margaret brennan so you re saying no way would hunter biden ever be called to testify representative jerry nadler well i m saying that hunter biden has no knowledge of the accusations against the president did the president as we said as the evidence shows that he did betray his country margaret brennan mm hm representative jerry nadler by conspiring with a foreign country to to try to rig the election hunter biden has nothing to say about that they re they re asking for hunter biden is just more of a smear of hunter biden that the president is trying to get the ukraine to do but the fact of the matter is let the chief justice rule on on margaret brennan well representative jerry nadler the chief justice in the first instance rules on evidence the senate can overrule him margaret brennan yeah representative jerry nadler but no chief justice would would would think of of admitting evidence that that it is not relevant margaret brennan well i representative jerry nadler no trial judge would in any trial margaret brennan i want to ask you about evidence because lev parnas the business associate of rudy giuliani some of the documents that he turned over were included in the briefs submitted by democrats just last night are many republicans say representative jerry nadler mm hm margaret brennan shouldn t be admissible at all do democrats want to hear him testify and given his legal troubles given his ties to russian oligarchs why do you think he is credible representative jerry nadler well he seems to be credible because everything he says corroborates things we knew new documents that that he has brought out corrob from the time corroborate what he was saying but the the main credit the main thing is all relevant evidence should be admitted and the president has engaged in a in a concerted attempt margaret brennan mm hm representative jerry nadler to deny all evidence everyone who testified defied the president testifying i mean mike pompeo ought to testify john bolton ought to testify what is the president hiding the president says don t let these people testify if they were if they had exculpatory evidence he would be saying let them testify margaret brennan well as you know the white house argues that it sets a dangerous precedent for future presidents but i want to ask you about representative jerry nadler there is no precedent margaret brennan i want to ask you about representative jerry nadler that is that is that is nonsense margaret brennan the president s legal team or at least some lawyers who are going to be speaking on behalf of the president alan dershowitz among them ken starr also added as someone who is going to be speaking before the senate what do you think of their additions to the team what does that suggest to you as someone who will be prosecuting representative jerry nadler i am not going to comment on their witnesses except that ken starr thinks that apparently thinks that asking a foreign government to involve itself in our elections is okay but the president twenty years ago talking about a private sexual affair now that s impeachable i mean he s he s it s ridiculous margaret brennan and alan dershowitz says it s not a constitutional criteria for impeachment abuse of power it doesn t meet that standard representative jerry nadler well i was surprised to see alan dershowitz say that that s simply ignorance if you read all the history of impeachments in the country if you read the federalist papers if you read the margaret brennan mm hm representative jerry nadler consti the the constitutional convention debates from the 1780s if you read the majority staff report of the house judiciary committee in 1974 there s no question about that margaret brennan yeah okay representative jerry nadler it s ridiculous margaret brennan all right chairman we ll be watching thank you very much for your time this morning we now go to a senator who was part of a small group of republicans invited to discuss impeachment trial strategy with leader mcconnell that s texas senator john cornyn who joins us now from austin good morning to you senator senator john cornyn r texas johncornyn good morning margaret margaret brennan what can you expect to see this week how long will this process take will there be a motion to dismiss or are we charging ahead with this trial senator john cornyn well we ll start with the introduction of the resolution that will guide the schedule on tuesday and in the clinton impeachment that was adopted by a hundred senators here unfortunately our democratic colleagues are probably not going to participate but it is fifty three senators i believe will embrace essentially the same rules of the road that applied to the clinton impeachment trial deferring the decision about additional witnesses until after both sides have had a chance to make their presentation and senators have a chance to ask questions and so we ll be sitting there in our chairs about probably on the order of six hours a day starting at 1 00 pm on east eastern time and then six days a week so this is going to be i think kind of a grueling exercise but also one that will be public margaret brennan so you say there will be at some point a decision on and potentially a vote on whether to allow witnesses you re in leadership senator john cornyn well i would margaret brennan do republicans have the numbers to block that vote from actually approving witnesses to be heard senator john cornyn well if i can make a distinction margaret the the house heard testimony from seventeen witnesses more than a hundred hours of testimony all of that will be available to the impeachment managers to present their case to the senate and then after they are through then if the senators fifty one senators want to hear more then then we can vote to subpoena those witnesses margaret brennan well as you know house democrats argue not all the facts have been revealed that s why they are arguing for new witnesses and new evidence to be introduced i know you ve said you re open to hearing from former national security adviser john bolton does that mean that the rest of republican leadership is open to issuing a subpoena to compel him senator john cornyn well i find it curious that chairman nadler of the judiciary committee called this a rock solid case but if the house isn t prepared to go forward with the evidence that they produced in the impeachment inquiry maybe they ought to withdraw the articles of impeachment and and start over again this isn t the senate s responsibility to make the case this is the house s responsibility under the constitution the senate s supposed to decide the case sitting as a court of impeachment margaret brennan right senator john cornyn so this is really on the house to make that decision they can continue to process additional witnesses in the house they could even vote on additional articles of impeachment but this to me seems to undermine or indicate that they re getting cold feet or have a lack of confidence in what they ve done so far margaret brennan but but yet you say the door is still open to holding a vote to hear from witnesses i mean you were mitch mcconnell s senator john cornyn yes margaret brennan number two for for some time do you think he can control the caucus to prevent a vote to approve witnesses senator john cornyn well this is a very serious matter obviously this is the third time in american history where we have had a trial on impeachment charges unfortunately this seems to be more of a political or policy differences than than actually a high crime and misdemeanor as the constitution requires so i think we margaret brennan so so you reject senator john cornyn we re going to proceed with caution margaret brennan you reject that government watchdog report the gao report that does say there was a violation of the law senator john cornyn certainly not a crime and something that no one had ever dreamed in the past would have been risen to the level of impeachment this is one of the basic problems with the house s case margaret brennan but isn t it central senator john cornyn is the constitution margaret brennan to that question of the president withholding aid for personal gain which is the allegation senator john cornyn well it s it is he has been charged with abuse of power which is not treason which is not bribery which is not a high crime and misdemeanor so this is the first time in history where a president has been impeached for a non crime for events that never occurred ultimately the investigation never took place and ultimately the their aid was delivered margaret brennan well senator john cornyn this is really unique and i think every senator is going to take this very seriously margaret brennan well that that is certainly what the the white house is arguing but i want to ask you about the legal brief that democrats did submit it included a number of things including documents that have been revealed recently by lev parnas an indicted business associate of rudy giuliani among them a letter that says that rudy giuliani himself was acting with the approval and knowledge of the president when he was reaching out to the president of ukraine should all of these items be admissible during trial senator john cornyn well as you know margaret i was a judge for thirteen years in in state courts and in no court in america would that kind of hearsay be admissible but having said that i would be margaret brennan it s a letter from rudy giuliani senator john cornyn well i would be careful before crediting the veracity of somebody who is under indictment in new york the southern district of new york and who s trying to get leniency from the prosecutor and who has ties to russian oligarchs margaret brennan well yeah he senator john cornyn the russians have margaret brennan exactly but senator john cornyn had a lot to do with our elections and disinformation campaigns and this could be part of that margaret brennan and you certainly would have knowledge since you re on senate intelligence on that but given what you re saying are lev parnas ties to russian oligarchs which is often shorthand for russian mafia doesn t it trouble you that he was working so closely with rudy giuliani who is acting on the president s behalf and saying he was acting on the president s behalf senator john cornyn well there s no question that there have been a a series of grifters and other hangers on that have associated themselves with the president s campaign or claimed to have special relationships with the president but this is not the issue that the senate s going to be deciding we ll take the issue of evidence as it comes if the impeachment managers want to rest their case on the credibility of somebody who s under indictment in the southern district of new york with extensive ties to russian oligarchs and organized crime as you point out then that s their choice margaret brennan is congress going to investigate should they investigate what was going on with ambassador marie yovanovitch who according to these documents released by lev parnas appears to have been under surveillance senator john cornyn i m sure that will happen and i know the ukrainian government has asked for some help in in some of this investigation but as you point out i ve been a member of the senate intelligence committee during a three year plus investigation into the russian active measures campaign we know that ukraine was plagued with corruption we know of the ties between ukraine and and russian oligarchs which are proxies for vladimir putin and so that s why i think we need to approach all of this with a little bit of caution and make sure we have our facts right and make sure we know about the credibility problems that some of these purported witnesses have before we take it at face value margaret brennan but these text messages are you saying there s reason not to believe that she was indeed being surveilled or potentially at risk senator john cornyn yeah i just don t know the answer to that i would say i d i d say anything is possible in this in this smarmy environment in ukraine and and and and in russia margaret brennan do you have questions for rudy giuliani about any of this senator john cornyn not relative to the impeachment i just you know that s that s a relationship that causes many of us to sort of scratch our heads but i d say he is not relevant to the articles and what the senate s going to be asked to do impeaching a president for the third time in american history for a non crime over events that never occurred margaret brennan senator cornyn thank you and we ll be back in one minute with former director of the national economic council gary cohn stay with us announcements margaret brennan we re back with gary cohn he is the former director of the national economic council under president trump he s back in the private sector these days thank you for being here gary cohn former director of the national economic council gary d cohn thank you for having me margaret brennan so the economy is going to be front and center in this election many economists say we re overdue for a recession do you think we re on the brink of one gary cohn margaret first of all it s great to be here i know a lot of people have been talking about a recession i do not see a recession on the horizon here the u s economy is strong and continues to be very strong the u s consumer is very strong if you look at what s happened in the last couple of years with tax reform we have put more disposable income in the hands of the u s consumer and the u s consumer is out spending it margaret brennan so then why is the president and his the man currently in the job you once held larry kudlow continuing to criticize the fed chairman gary cohn i am not worried about interest rates right now i think our interest rate policy is in a good place i think the consumer is in a good place and i think the u s economy is in a good place we actually have interest rates at a level right now where activity is growing i think that you know fourth quarter gdp will come in around two two and a half percent margaret brennan so you gary cohn probably two and a half percent margaret brennan you differ from the president on that quibble about interest rates currently gary cohn i don t think i differ from the president on the economy being strong margaret brennan right gary cohn i think we agree completely about the economy is strong margaret brennan but on interest rates gary cohn yeah i agree that i i think the fed is in a good place on interest rate policy margaret brennan i want to ask you about trade this week the united states and china the two largest economies in the world signed this phase one trade deal there s like two hundred billion in promised purchases but there are still like three hundred billion dollars worth of goods under tariff so what does this actually accomplish what what do you see it gary cohn so first of all anytime the united states and china get together and sign an agreement i think we should applaud that i mean the mere fact that we got a ninety plus page agreement signed between between the two countries is very good relative to where we were months ago when everyone thought we were going to continue to feud with china so we ve got some trade agreement in place the chinese are going to buy some more goods from the united states which has to be a good thing but there s also in that agreement there are some provisions that free up trademarks and trade patents and trade secrets which is very very good no this didn t margaret brennan i thought this was about intellectual property gary cohn this didn t i said margaret brennan and theft and all of those things gary cohn this didn t address look this margaret brennan yeah gary cohn did not address the big issue the big issue the president and i agreed upon is that the chinese had been stealing our intellectual property they ve been infringing on our our trademarks they ve been infringing on our copyrights it has not addressed that and we still have to continue to address that margaret brennan do you think that china is going to hold up its end of the deal and actually enact some of the reforms they say they re going to carry out gary cohn i i think they re going to i think they re going to open up their markets i think the chinese have been closed to opening up their markets for the for the industries that were listed in there so i m cautiously optimistic that the chinese are going to start reforming and opening up their markets margaret brennan so you resigned over a difference about tariffs or at least that was a gary cohn yeah i don t think that s actua accurate but go ahead margaret brennan well then why did you resign gary cohn well look i i i left the administration for a variety of different reasons and and the president and i had very open conversations about my policy views and his policy views we d accomplished a lot and at the end of the day he was going a different direction on some of the trade negotiations than i would have gone i agreed fundamentally on what the issue was margaret brennan mm hm gary cohn i just didn t agree on how to solve the issue margaret brennan so the steel and aluminum tariffs was what many thought was the impetus for your resignation gary cohn well i didn t think margaret brennan you re saying it s not gary cohn i didn t think the steel and aluminum tariffs were helpful to our economy margaret brennan but when it comes to the tariffs that were used to get to the the negotiating table with china on this deal or where ultimately they ended up with the free trade deal the new nafta so to speak usmca can the president say look people may not like my tactics but i got this done was he ultimately right were you wrong gary cohn they they can say that i don t think we would have gotten to a different outcome i don t think the tariffs helped us get to any different outcome margaret brennan did it hurt the u s gary cohn i think it has hurt the u s i think it s totally hurt the united states look the u s economy is very strong very solid employment growth is great but we re missing a big component we re missing the capital expenditures from companies in the united states that was a key component to tax reform margaret brennan lowering the corporate tax rate is what you thought was going to get companies gary cohn not margaret brennan to spend more gary cohn not lowering we actually gave them expensing of capex for the first five years they get a hundred percent expense their capex but the minute you turn around and put steel and aluminum tariffs on them the minute a company is thinking about spending capital what do you go out and buy you go out and buy steel and aluminum that s how you build factories that s how you build property plant equipment so all of the sudden the advantages that we were trying to give companies to help stimulate the economy to build facilities to go out and hire people to drive wages we took away that advantage by taxing the input that they needed to build margaret brennan you re saying the president got in his own way gary cohn i m saying the policies collided with each other margaret brennan gary cohn stay with us and we will be right back in a moment announcements margaret brennan cbs news plans special coverage each day of the senate impeachment trial proceedings on the broadcast network and on our digital network cbsn starting this coming tuesday at 1 00 pm as for face the nation we ll be right back in a moment announcements margaret brennan and we will have more special coverage each day of the impeachment trial but stay with us on face the nation more of our interview with gary cohn former national economic council director under the trump administration stay ahead announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we continue our conversation with former director of the national economic council gary cohn so at this signing ceremony the president did this week with china he said president donald trump wednesday i made a lot of bankers look very good margaret brennan the top six u s banks saved about thirty two billion dollars because of the tax cuts that you helped craft this is analysis according to to bloomberg news the the hit on the tax law is that it is good for corporations it s good for business it s not good for the little guy why do you think this analysis is wrong the president seems to be saying and applauding that he s helping out big banks gary cohn well our our tax bill s clearly working which is great we have made u s businesses competitive again with the rest of the world we lowered the corporate tax rate to twenty one percent so we now have a corporate tax rate that is competitive with the rest of the world yes we lowered corporate tax rates and that in itself cost less than a hundred billion dollars a year to do that but it stimulates huge economic growth the businesses in the united states now can thrive which means that they can grow they can go out and hire people which we ve seen we ve seen record unemployment we ve seen record unemployment rates down to three and a half percent we ve seen wage growth we ve seen three percent plus wage growth and most importantly margaret brennan you put this all on the tax law gary cohn we ve seen a lot of it has to do with tax law it has to we ve seen higher end wage growth at the bottom pay scale than we have at the top so we re seeing the incentives that we created in the tax law by lowering the corporate rate we re seeing that happen and and that is happening in the last couple of years margaret brennan there s a whole debate about the contribution to the deficit but i want to put that aside here because i want to focus in on something gary cohn oh please don t margaret brennan i want to focus in on something though that that is really resonating politically and it is this broader argument that this country somehow is rigged to benefit the wealthy and disadvantage the poor and you ve even had jamie dimon the ceo of ceo of jpmorgan you ve had hank paulson former treasury secretary former head of goldman sachs i know you know him they have said that they are all concerned about income inequality growing in this country are you concerned gary cohn of course i m concerned margaret brennan but you but you don t gary cohn we we re all concerned margaret brennan think in any way that there have been contributions to that through the tax law you helped write gary cohn i i think there have been contributions for the positive i think if you look at the data you ll see that we have grown wages margaret brennan mm hm gary cohn at the bottom end of the pay cy cycle scale i m sorry pay cy scale faster than we ve grown them at the top that s exactly what we re trying to do we re trying to attract more jobs back to the united states put more people to work and that s what we re seeing happening margaret brennan michael bloomberg says about this tax law nearly all the money goes to people like me who don t need it this is a guy who knows wall street who is a billionaire he is saying that the tax law is is only advantaging people like him gary cohn i d love to know how it s advantaging him i d i d love to see that because at the end of the day we have lowered rates i ll agree that we ve lowered rates we have broadened the base meaning that we make more of your income taxable that s basic tax policy lower rates broaden base meaning you get rid of more of the loopholes that people have used to deduct from their income what they pay taxes on we got rid of a lot of the loopholes margaret brennan mm hm gary cohn so people are having to pay more taxes they are having to pay tax on more of their income yes they are paying it at a little lower rate margaret brennan are you going to endorse michael bloomberg whose board i believe you sit on gary cohn i do not i do not margaret brennan as part of one of his bloomberg entities gary cohn i sit on one of his his emerging market boards i guess it s a board margaret brennan but that doesn t mean you re necessarily going to be voting for him gary cohn it does not margaret brennan two of the candidates who are also vying for the democratic nomination bernie sanders elizabeth warren constantly come back to this idea of income inequality they have proposed taxes on billionaires taxes on financial transactions elizabeth warren has specifically referred to that people making over fifty million dollars having an additional two percent tax what would the impact of those policies be from your perspective gary cohn look our tax system in the united states is very very progressive we have over fifty percent of the population today of workers do not pay a dollar of federal income tax so if you re going to collect more revenue which i am not against we have to collect more revenue margaret brennan mm hm gary cohn it s going to come from the top half of workers and in fact it s going to come from the top ten percent of workers that s where that s where you can find the taxable income i think that we will end up doing that we will potentially need to do that but these fangled plans that they are coming up with we don t need to do things like that to collect more income from people we have a basic tax system that works and we can do some basic fundamental things if we need to collect more money the question is margaret brennan mm hm gary cohn do we need to collect more money you know we look at spending and we look at revenue and we don t talk about them in the same sentence we we collect taxes and then we spend and and congress never thinks about how much money they have to spend they just go spend margaret brennan mm hm gary cohn and so you wouldn t run your household like that i wouldn t run my household like that i would decide how much revenue i have and then how much i could spend margaret brennan but you re you re a democrat gary cohn yes i am margaret brennan is there a single democrat that you would consider voting for gary cohn there there i i ll consider voting for anyone i vote on policy margaret brennan even elizabeth warren whose policy you just tried to gary cohn i will consider voting for anyone i said i didn t say i would i said i d consider voting for them margaret brennan well that s evasive gary cohn yeah margaret brennan in pulling apart some of her proposals you seem to be reflecting a lot of what wall street says which is that there is deep concern over this focus on the financial community on corporations etcetera gary cohn i margaret brennan in this environment gary cohn look at margaret brennan is this enough that you see some of the people you know gary cohn i margaret brennan on wall street continuing to vote along lines of whatever the president is putting forward even if they don t like some of his behavior vote for him because of what he is doing for gary cohn that s a margaret brennan banks gary cohn that s a hypothetical question i don t know what i do know margaret brennan you don t know who you re voting for gary cohn what i do know is the economy is really strong margaret brennan mm hm gary cohn and the democrats haven t really come up with an idea how to help the economy get even stronger so it s probably easier to talk about corporate greed and talk about wall street and talk about technology companies because they don t really have an answer for an economy that s growing two and a half percent with three and a half percent unemployment and three percent wage growth i haven t heard their answer on that except let s tax it to death margaret brennan so as you said you identify as a democrat you did have disagreements with the president on a number of things i was there in trump tower the day of the charlottesville reference fine people on both sides i remember your face that day and you were very public about some of your differences with the president will you vote for him gary cohn look i am very supportive of the president s economic policy i am very supportive of what he s done on deregulation i haven t heard anyone who s come up with a better policy yet now i just don t vote on the economy margaret brennan mm hm gary cohn i vote on a lot of the social issues as well so you know in many respects i ve got to balance both sides of that equation before i figure out who i am going to vote for margaret brennan so you re leaving the door open gary cohn i m leaving the door open but at this point i don t have any intention not to vote for the president margaret brennan you are a frank guy you re usually pretty direct gary cohn yeah margaret brennan is there anyone around the president who can be direct with him right now is there anyone doing what you said you did when guiding him on some of these economic policies gary cohn i don t know i ve been gone a year and a half i i am sure there are people when you re talking to the president margaret brennan but when when the president can say look i ve gotten these tariffs that have helped me get this free trade deal with north america these tariffs have helped me get this phase one deal with china doesn t that encourage the president s approach one that you have said you have differed with him on gary cohn it may encourage his approach but he he s also got advisors in there that i m sure are telling him differences i know that there are people in there you know secretary mnuchin and i had a lot of conversations where we agreed on tariffs and i m sure the secretary is talking to the president about tariffs and what effect they are having and what effect they are not having margaret brennan lastly i want to ask you about a new book i know you haven t read it it s coming out but there have been excerpts released that directly reference you which is why gary cohn mm hm margaret brennan i want to give you a chance to respond he s called the president is is in this meeting accused of calling advisers dopes and babies and the like is the the description of the president and his management style mat matching your experience gary cohn i don t know what book you re referring to as you said i haven t read it so i i i i wouldn t know margaret brennan the management style of berating advisers gary cohn look the the president is what you see on tv is exactly what you get in private with the president the president is the same person behind closed doors as he is out in public which is a which is a unique feature you know it s it s not like he turns it on or turns it off when he walks outside so you have seen everything the president has that s exactly what you see when you re in a private meeting with him margaret brennan all right gary cohn thank you for your time gary cohn thank you margaret brennan we ll be right back with our political panel stay with us announcements margaret brennan we turn now to our political panel for some analysis gerry seib is the executive washington editor at the wall street journal susan page is the washington bureau chief of usa today ed o keefe is our chief political correspondent and weijia jiang covers the white house for cbs news welcome to the table ed o keefe cbs news political correspondent edokeefe good to see you margaret brennan gerry the president seems to have shifted his request for what he wants out of this senate trial or at least the senate may not be giving him everything gerald seib wall street journal geraldfseib yeah margaret brennan he wants what s going on behind the scenes gerald seib i think in the last few days there has been a feeling that s taken hold that the white house is being conveyed to senate republicans that we would like to get this impeachment trial over with as fast as possible as opposed to let s stretch it out let s have this exonerate the president i think there is now a real fear that the longer this goes on the greater the risk of unexpected unpleasant surprises and lev parnas who you talked about earlier kind of illustrated that this week somebody comes in out of the blue during the middle of a process starts saying things that make republicans very nervous maybe that increases the chances that senate republicans will vote to call witnesses that s not where the white house wants to go so i think you re seeing the president pressure senate republicans and you re seeing senate republicans having conversations this weekend about how can we speed this up and get to the finish line faster margaret brennan but susan you you heard some of this with senator cornyn i mean he he is talking about the gravity of the moment that doesn t sound like something you put on fast forward susan page usa today susanpage you know i thought it was remarkable what we saw over the last couple of days we we ve been talking about impeachment since inauguration day gerald seib mm hm susan page it s not a surprise that the president is being impeached although maybe it s a surprise that it s over aid to ukraine but i thought that with the transmission of the articles of impeachment with the arrival of the chief justice with the senators signing the oath book that we had a sense of have the importance and the gravity of what is ahead i m not sure that s going to hold for an impeachment trial especially with alan dershowitz on the on the president s defense team but for at least a moment it seemed like a different kind a more serious exercise than it seemed before margaret brennan weijia you spoke to alan dershowitz i know in your reporting he s got his own legal problems but he is someone the public knows well from being on television ken starr people know him from the clinton impeachment what is behind this this casting if that s the right word of these individuals weijia jiang cbs news white house correspondent weijia you know that baggage could follow them if you believe that the company you keep says something about you but president trump clearly doesn t care because he really cares about the appearance of his legal team and he thinks that dershowitz and starr despite the other things that come along with them will lend credibility to his case along with quote great television ratings according to an adviser to the white house so the president thinks that they will make for great tv to put on a show for who he believes are the real jurors in this case not the senators but the people watching at home margaret brennan will it be great tv ed i mean this is something that is so so solemn so scripted the senators can t even speak ed o keefe right and i think there s only margaret brennan is mitch mcconnell planning for great tv ed o keefe well margaret brennan or is he seeing something else or not ed o keefe he s he s hoping for a dignified process and if that means bad tv so be it remember there s only going to be like four camera angles in the room we don t get to see the jurors necessarily during this trial so get no facial reactions from guys like jim inhofe or chris murphy you know it s just it s just going to be sort of whoever is speaking and the chief justice for the most part he ll get plenty of air time look mcconnell has four priorities here over the course of the next few weeks manage the senate and make sure it s a dignified process but three other important things he s got to manage the president and his expectations he s got to manage the fact that several twenty two of his colleagues are up for reelection and about seven or eight of them are in trickier contests than they d like and he has his own reelection back home so he has to be seen as not only maintaining the decorum but also keeping in the back of his mind or in front of him that this could be a factor eleven months from now in elections across the country susan page you know what he s lucky with john mccain is not in the senate ed o keefe yeah susan page can you imagine the fifth and sixth and seventh chores that mcconnell would face if john mccain were still representing the state of arizona what does that mean others lindsey graham would do does that mean mitt romney would feel more empowered to stand up in a serious way ed o keefe yeah and i would i would argue too that there could be somebody who emerges if not a mccain some republican that does step up and say we do need to allow this to play out a little more gerald seib but we should remember though that the the moment that would make for great tv to your question would be if john bolton the former national security adviser does in fact testify that would be great tv that would be a dramatic moment and i think not getting to that point is a top goal of mitch mcconnell and the white house margaret brennan and while impeachment does not poll as a political win necessarily for democrats it s apparently helping fundraising at the rnc jerry gerald seib oh it has and it has since for several weeks now and they ve raised millions of dollars and they ve signed up lots of volunteers people on the trump team people out in the country are are unhappy about this and they re voting with their feet and their dollars right now to some extent by the way one of the other groups that has to be worried about this the thirty house democrats who come from districts that donald trump won in 2016 and part of what the republican machinery is doing is going after those people they voted except for one for impeachment republicans would like to ensure they pay a price for that politically as well weijia jiang the campaign is really capitalizing this as well too sources say every time there s a twist and turn in this entire process you see that being advertised to supporters and they say there s a spike in the money that they re bringing in every time something significant happens and so they re not shying away from this and and they re owning the fact that it s helping them financially so we ll continue to see sort of this campaign for more money as this process goes on margaret brennan is there concern in the white house about lev parnas rudy giuliani s business associate you ve heard senator cornyn and others say not credible not worth listening to weijia jiang there is concern because there s a recognition among sources who are being honest that even if he s not an official witness he s already impacting this trial unless senators are completely tuned out they are absorbing what he is saying and they are seeing what he is dropping in these document dumps so even though the president insists that he has no idea who parnas is the problem is parnas has receipts and he margaret brennan and selfies weijia jiang exactly not one not two but a whole collection that tells a story of two men who know each other over the course of years and so the president has to add to his defense he can t just say i don t know who he is susan page you know i think great tv maybe but i am not sure it matters in the substance of the trial in that there s not really a dispute over what happened aid got delayed the president wanted an investigation of joe biden by ukraine now there s an argument about whether it s an impeachable offense margaret brennan mm hm susan page there s an argument about the president s motives but but in a way the the facts are are set and i wonder if at the end of the day when we get to election day does would this even matter you know this is margaret brennan yeah susan page part of the presi in a way these people have absorbed this idea already and made up their minds about whether they care margaret brennan well ed what about that and what about some of the jurors who are running for office themselves ed o keefe right so four of course are senators running for president bernie sanders elizabeth warren amy klobuchar and michael bennet who spends most of his time in new hampshire all of them concede this is going to be a problem for them all of them were in or on the trail again this weekend trying to button things up admitting to voters i might not be back before caucus day sorry about that they ll send their spouses they ll send surrogates they re establishing office hours at their campaign offices across new hampshire and iowa for people to come meet their surrogates and ask questions and they will find ways from washington if need be to campaign whether that s holding skype sessions with voters or calling in to rallies and certainly doing television interviews but they all understand they could be at a huge disadvantage and if you look at the schedule in the coming days who s spending most of their time in iowa and new hampshire joe biden and pete buttigieg who sit up there with bernie sanders and elizabeth warren at the top especially in iowa so we ve never seen anything like this and it will really sort of test whether being there and the face time that voters in these early states crave is a factor or whether those four senators have done enough already to bank away goodwill and votes margaret brennan and gerry what do you make though of the argument that democrats need to be campaigning on issues like health care speaker pelosi says how do you respond to what gary cohn laid out which was it s hard to run against a strong economy gerald seib yeah well margaret brennan how do you turn back to the senate gerald seib well first of all i thought it was very instructive that there was almost no discussion of of impeachment in the debate the democrats had this week they re not eager to talk about this out in the country second of all i think gary cohn made a really good point where is the conversation in the democratic primary dialogue about how to create jobs and what the role of the private sector is in creating jobs you listen in vain there s no discussion of that and that s the bernie sanders elizabeth warren effect on the field but you wonder whether that s really resonating with the moderates in the party margaret brennan right gerald seib because they would like to hear some conversation about job creation and good wages and they re not hearing it susan page and of course the person talking about that is mike bloomberg who s not even competing gerald seib yeah susan page in iowa and who i think maybe maybe somebody we re not talking about enough in terms of the possibility he could emerge as a contender margaret brennan all right well thanks to all of you we will be right back in a moment announcements margaret brennan there is a lot of news on the supreme court beat this week so who better to bring in for some analysis than our own chief legal correspondent jan crawford jan it s good to have you here you you know the court very well and john roberts chief justice we don t hear from him very often he will now be at the center of the senate impeachment trial what do you i mean how is he going to the shape this jan crawford cbs news chief legal correspondent jancbs well that s the the thing i mean we may not hear very much from him at all during this trial because his role in this trial is completely different than what you think of as the role of a judge and in a sense he doesn t really have a lot of power the senate sets the rules so they have the first word and they can overturn any of his rulings by a majority vote so they have the last word so john roberts is going to be in this really kind of weird position where he may rule on some related matters or issues but then the senate could overrule him if it disagrees he has been talking about it margaret brennan and now he s stepping into one of the most politically heated partisan environment staying above that jan crawford exactly margaret brennan is going to be tough jan crawford it will be very tough and that s why a lot of people said this is a nightmare for the chief justice but it s also an opportunity because it s an opportunity to for him to show in this hyper partisan environment of the senate that he is above politics that he is neutral that he is not taking one side or the other so he s going to go there as the face of the supreme court and potentially see that as an opportunity to remind the american people that judges are above politics that is his opportunity and that is also his challenge margaret brennan i m going to ask you about something else that seemingly was historic this week both houses of the virginia legislature voted for to ratify the equal rights amendment jan crawford mm hm margaret brennan now a lot of people would say wait isn t that already law that you have to treat men and women equally but actually this proposal was never amended to the constitution you need thirty eight states three fourths of the country to actually go ahead and do it why has that benchmark why has this country never reached it and gone ahead and amended this in the constitution jan crawford well so i mean that s the great question right because on the surface it seems you know really straightforward of course women should be treated equally in the workplace of course women should get the same kind of equal access that men would and that was the way it was viewed in 1972 when congress with the broad support bipartisan supermajority of two thirds approved that resolution and sent it to the states to ratify three fourths of the states needed to ratify at thirty eight states and it gave the states a deadline of seven years to do so everyone thought it s going to happen thirty states passed it within the first year five more got on board pretty soon after that and then it ground to a halt and the reason is conservatives started kind of taking issue with certain things including the issue of abortion the supreme court ruled in roe v wade in 1973 that women had a constitutional right to abortion and then it occurred to certain ad activists that this era could further enshrine abortion rights in the constitution so it became controversial and there were other issues that that activists pointed out on the right that would raise concerns potentially for women margaret brennan and you said something important there a seven year deadline so this means it s expired jan crawford congress margaret brennan is this just symbolic jan crawford potentially yes after this expired in 1979 congress tried to extend it to 1982 just to give the states more time and no states jumped at it so it got stuck at thirty five virginia now ostensibly would be the thirty eighth state because we ve had two other states recently also approve it in the house later this month is going to take up a resolution to take out that deadline from the original amendment but that s entirely questionable whether that s constitutional margaret brennan mm hm jan crawford congress passed that in 1972 with two thirds vote and now to say that they re going to change it with the simple majority the courts i think it s it s pretty suspect and they re going to have a huge legal battle on that that potentially going back to john roberts could make its way to the supreme court margaret brennan and on to your desk jan crawford thank you very much we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan that s it for us today thank you for watching until next week for face the nation i m margaret brennan watch
