the top two primary could lock out democrats from key house races california s primary elections on june 5 will be one of the most consequential and bizarre contests of the entire primary season the golden state is crucial to democrats effort to retake the house republicans currently hold a whopping seven districts hillary clinton won and democrats are eager to pry them away the bizarreness though stems from california s extremely unusual top two primary system which pits all candidates of all parties against each other and lets only the first and second place finishers move on to the general election often the top two finishers are one republican and one democrat setting up a normal partisan general election contest but the top two can also be two candidates from the same party which would lock in the partisan outcome of a race months in advance this year democrats are anxious that they will end up shut out of several key house races where they have multiple candidates running which could badly hurt their chances of retaking the chamber republicans meanwhile dread being locked out of the governor s race an open contest now that gov jerry brown is term limited out they fear that would depress their voters turnout this fall so naturally both parties are furiously trying to game the system each is trying to make sure its votes are as concentrated as possible while the other party s are divided but those pesky candidates have minds of their own and often defy their own parties wishes it has the feeling of one of those civil wars in the middle ages where the king is fighting against barons and there s multiple alliances that form and collapse says eric mcghee a research fellow at the public policy institute of california it s a lot less straightforward than just you got your democrat you got your republican it s sort of organized chaos californians voted to establish the top two system by ballot initiative in 2010 they ve used it since for all elections for congress statewide offices and the state legislature the system s advocates hoped to break up the party dominated primary process which in their view too often led to two extreme candidates being nominated and being the only realistic choices in the general election to understand their thinking consider that classic political science concept the median voter theorem democrats running in their party s primary we d think would target the median democratic voter to try to win republicans would do the same for the median republican voter but at that stage of the process no one is incentivized to target the median voter in the state overall they re purely concerned with their own parties moderate republican state sen abel maldonado who championed the reform proposal argued that if all voters were voting in the same primary candidates would have more of an incentive to moderate and the actual median voter in the state would have more of a say another potential virtue of top two is in bringing competition even to safe seats one party is usually sure to win pitting say two democrats against each other in democratic leaning districts so that the incumbent doesn t get too comfortable and voters have some choice in the fall has it worked well a lot of other things happened at the same time the state adopted a new redistricting system and new state legislature term limit rules and the california republican party broadly declined so it s tough to say mcghee and boris shor found in a 2017 paper that democrats in the state legislature but not republicans did tend to be more moderate but they weren t sure top two had caused that additionally 2016 brought a new top two milestone as republicans failed to put up a serious candidate for the open us senate seat and two democrats kamala harris and loretta sanchez advanced to the general election in a state with far more democrats than republicans it makes sense that this would happen some of the time and it s not an obviously wrong outcome just 29 percent of votes in the primary went to the various republican candidates after all but there is a way the top two system can go quite awry sometimes in districts that are politically divided two candidates from the same party can end up making it through the primary due to unusual vote splits let s say there s a congressional primary where about 51 percent of the vote goes to republicans and 49 percent to democrats one would think a republican versus democrat top two matchup would best represent voters preferences in this swing district but think of the total primary vote as a pie the candidates are all trying to get slices of that pie and whoever gets the two biggest slices wins how much of the pie each party gets doesn t matter so if that 51 percent for the gop is split among two candidates and that 49 percent for democrats is split among say four candidates then the first and second place finishers could well be the two republicans this isn t just hypothetical it happened in california s 31st district in 2012 the two republicans got 26 7 percent and 24 8 percent of the vote the top democrat got 22 6 percent with the rest of the vote totaling 25 9 percent being split among three other democrats so the party was shut out of the general election for the house in a district barack obama ended up winning handily now a major party being locked out of a swing district isn t a common outcome in fact the above example is the only time it s happened in a competitive congressional district this decade but the chances of a swing district lockout tend to be highest in two types of races the first type is open seat contests in which the vote on either side could be split among multiple candidates the second type is races with troubled incumbents who ve drawn a significant challenger from their own party because after all there needs to be a second candidate of note in the race for a party to win both top slots even then a lockout is only likely when the race happens to develop in a very particular way in which one or both parties end up having too many evenly matched candidates so that no one candidate in a party manages to get a big enough slice of the pie for him or herself this issue is often shorthanded as too many candidates but the real issue is whether the candidates are evenly matched they won t affect things if they can t draw much of the vote think of the pie again in a district with about 50 percent democratic voters and 50 percent republican that is each party has about half the pie actual vote results are of course messier and unlikely to be so exactly matched but this gives you a sense of the math of how problematic it can be for one party to have more evenly matched candidates on its side than the other last week i asked a democratic operative focused on these contests to rank the races in which the party was most afraid of being locked out speaking on background the operative said there s one race in particular where the danger seems highest two more in which it also seems serious and then two others where it s a more remote possibility 1 the 48th district rep dana rohrabacher hillary clinton won this orange county district by 1 7 percentage points and the 30 year gop incumbent rohrabacher is plagued with scandal over his ties to russia so this seems like a top pickup opportunity for democrats but the operative told me this race has by far the most danger of a lockout that s because of rohrabacher s very weakness he s drawn one serious republican challenger former state assembly member scott baugh the worse rohrabacher does and the better baugh does the better the chances of a republican versus republican general election several democrats meanwhile are splitting their party s section of the pie into small slices real estate investor harley rouda and stem cell researcher hans keirstead appear to be the leaders in a nasty primary and several other democrats are in the race too 2 the 39th district retiring rep ed royce royce s retirement set off a stampede of candidates into this other orange county district hillary clinton won by 8 6 points on both sides there are six democrats seven republicans and four independents on the ballot on the republican side young kim is generally believed to be the frontrunner and likely to win one of the top two spots but democrats appear to be split among self funding lottery winner gil cisneros self funding retired insurance executive andy thorburn pediatrician mai khanh tran and former obama administration official sam jammal 3 the 49th district retiring rep darrell issa the democratic operative i spoke to thought the chance of a democratic lockout was comparable here to in the 39th but that a republican lockout was possible as well in this san diego area clinton 7 5 district there are four prominent democrats in this expensive contest real estate investor paul kerr nonprofit ceo and billionaire s granddaughter sara jacobs environmental lawyer mike levin and retired marine col doug applegate and none of them seems to have clearly broken away from the pack yet yet there are also eight republicans on the ballot and no obvious frontrunner or fundraising star among them in fact each democrat is better funded than any of the republicans running so while there s a risk here for democrats there s also a potential upside 4 the 10th district rep jeff denham this clinton 3 district in central california is a top tier target for democrats in the general election but it hasn t gotten too much attention in discussions of potential lockouts since denham appears likely to get the support of most gop voters still the democratic operative told me it s not without risk of a lockout the chance is there that s because there is one republican on the ballot in addition to denham ted howze a former city council member democrats meanwhile have six candidates on the ballot meaning there s at least a remote chance howze could get more than any one of them though it doesn t appear likely 5 the 50th district rep duncan hunter this is a much more republican leaning district than those above trump won this suburban san diego district by 15 points so it s not as high a priority for democrats but the scandal plagued hunter is under fbi investigation for potentially misusing campaign funds and his fundraising has been dismal and he s drawn two republican challengers el cajon mayor bill wells and business exec shamus sayed meanwhile 28 year old public affairs consultant ammar campa najjar and former navy seal josh butner are in a nasty democratic primary with realtor patrick malloy also in the race but if one of hunter s gop challengers can make serious gains among republican voters in this red district an all gop general election is a possibility democratic strategists tasked with retaking the house have been worried about lockouts for months and have been taking steps to try to stop it from happening the strategy for a party trying to avoid a lockout is relatively simple they want to concentrate their own voters while dividing their opponents voters so for instance in the 48th district race democrats pressured three of their eight candidates on the ballot to withdraw so the democratic vote would be less divided then just recently the democratic congressional campaign committee threw its backing behind one candidate running harley rouda hoping to concentrate the party s support further and lock down one of those slots in the 39th district open seat contest in orange county there s even more intrigue not only did democrats recently broker a truce of sorts between two of their top candidates who d been nastily squabbling cisneros and thorburn but the party is deliberately trying to divide gop voters as well the problem for a party trying to game the system in its favor is that candidates often have minds of their own and interests that differ from those of the party several democratic candidates evidently view 2018 as a golden opportunity to win political office for themselves and have resisted the party s entreaties to quit the race for the partisan greater good meanwhile national democrats focused on taking the house would dearly love it if two democrats advanced in the governor s race they think gop voters would be less likely to turn out in november if they have no governor candidate on the ballot and with both lt gov gavin newsom and former los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa in the race a democrat on democrat runoff seems like a real possibility yet newsom the frontrunner has other ideas he s lately been airing ads saying that john cox the apparent top republican in a weak gop field stands with donald trump and the nra this is pretty obviously an attempt to help cox advance attacking him from the left so as to unite the gop vote around him newsom evidently thinks he d be assured of winning in the fall against a republican and that his prospects would be less certain against a democrat like villaraigosa all of this goes to show that there s a lot of opportunity for mischief in the top two system so much can hinge on whether say the fourth place republican draws 5 percent of the vote or 10 percent of the vote or whether a democrat and republican who aren t even competing for the same voters rank second or third or third and second the parties are spending millions to try to get the outcomes they want or at least to try to avoid disaster but their best laid plans could go very awry indeed get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
