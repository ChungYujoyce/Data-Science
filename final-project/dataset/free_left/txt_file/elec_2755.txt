there is no way to sugarcoat this at sunday night s presidential debate donald trump threatened to throw hillary clinton in jail if he wins the presidency this threatening to jail one s political opponents is how democratic norms die the exchange happened during a discussion of the controversy over hillary clinton s private email server trump began by decrying clinton s conduct which according to the fbi was quite bad but not illegal he then proposed appointing a special prosecutor to investigate her and warned clinton that if he were president now you d be in jail trump i ll tell you what i didn t think i d say this and i m going to say it and hate to say it if i win i m going to instruct the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there s never been so many lies so much deception a very expensive process so we re going to get a special prosecutor because people have been their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what you ve done and it s a disgrace and honestly you ought to be ashamed clinton let me just talk about emails because everything he just said is absolutely false but i m not surprised it s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of donald trump is not in charge of the law of our country dt because you d be in jail this is so far beyond normal that it s hard to even know where to start in democracies we respect people s rights to disagree with each other when one candidate wins a presidential election the loser returns to private life or another government position in some cases former rivals become close friends george h w bush and bill clinton who defeated bush in the 1992 election travel together and have spent decades jointly raising money to aid the victims of natural disasters they don t get sent to jail because we believe that political disagreement should be legal donald trump doesn t seem to care about all that in his last line you d be in jail he is outright saying that he would imprison hillary clinton in office if he could this comes despite the fact that there is no evidence clinton committed a crime in her handling of the email servers despite lengthy investigations that found evidence of carelessness and dishonesty that would be a politically motivated prosecution retribution for daring to run against trump and attack him during the campaign this is everything we feared about donald trump his long history of trying to silence critics with lawsuits his inability to let personal slights go his pettiness the nightmare scenario is that these would incline him to use the power of the presidency to forcibly silence his critics and opponents that s what is done by tin pot dictators spanning the globe from north korea to zimbabwe that s what happens in countries where peaceful transitions of power are the exception not the rule donald trump just threatened to bring that to america get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
