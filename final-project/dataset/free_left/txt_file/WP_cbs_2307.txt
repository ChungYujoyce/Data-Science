a self described genius entrepreneur with a coronavirus prevention pill arrested by the fbi you take this pill once a day and you cannot contract the virus televangelist jim bakker sued by the state of missouri to stop promoting silver solution a so called cure for covid 19 which his tv spot claims totally eliminates it kills it deactivates it they are just two examples of modern day medical quackery the term quack originates from the word quacksalver a middle dutch word that means somebody who boasts or brags about themselves said dr lydia kang co author of a book on the long history of quackery so it s somebody on the street corner that s hawking their wares kang defines quackery as the promotion of a treatment or cure without a solid scientific basis in other words fake medicine and it s generally thought to have reached its heyday in this country toward the end of the nineteenth century correspondent mo rocca said when i hear the word quack i instantly think snake oil salesman why at the end of the 1800s there was a guy named clark stanley who was selling a liniment that he claimed had snake oil in it kang replied and he was saying basically it could cure everything as for what was actually in it it had beef fat and pepper and turpentine said kang but there was no snake oil in it and he made a ton of money off of it but many discredited practices were genuinely considered best practices in their time for thousands of years trepanning the drilling of holes in the head was used to release evil spirits and long before the current opioid epidemic opium the highly addictive narcotic derived from the opium poppy plant was a respectable go to pain reliever kang said they used it for everything under the sun so you know if you re having a bad day you would take some opium you re nervous you take some opium if you have some crying babies at home and you re busy parents trying to go to the factory you dose em up with some opium heroin a derivative of opium was once even sold over the counter by bayer for sore throats and respiratory ailments at the opposite end of things there were equally un scientific remedies my gosh they used so many different things in enemas said kang pretty much anything in your kitchen cupboard could go into an enema so things like milk and honey and then there was the tobacco enema you ve probably heard of the term blowing smoke up someone s a kang laughed yes that s where that expression comes from in england for a little while they were actually used as a means of reviving drowning victims and remember mummy eating you re glad you don t one of the weirdest things is that egyptian mummies were taken from their tombs stolen and then sold overseas because they were considered this fantastic remedy for everything said kang rocca asked how could you be assured that you were eating a ground up mummy and not just some random guy that is true people would sometimes take like dirt and soil and ashes and they d be like oh this is bona fide real mummy now lest we mock our benighted forebears too much kang notes accepted practices today that might very well be seen as quackery in 50 or 75 years time oh absolutely you know it s funny when i was in medical school there was this saying which was half of what we re teaching you here is wrong we just don t know which half fifty years from now the things that i think are going to be really considered right now kind of barbaric are going to be things like the way that we screen for cancers so for example doing a colonoscopy and having to drink that terrible prep and going to get the actual colonoscopy done of course colonoscopies work they re essential in screening for colon cancer an important distinction from certain products being pushed today and with the public concern about covid 19 scammers everywhere are including that in whatever they re marketing said dr stephen barrett who runs the internet site quackwatch he said the most dangerous is a product called miracle mineral solution or mms an industrial strength bleach that s right bleach mms has been falsely promoted as a cure for everything from hiv to malaria and now covid 19 the fda pretty much drove the sellers out of the u s market barrett said yet this past thursday president trump wondered out loud whether injecting household disinfectant into the body might kill coronavirus i see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute one minute mr trump said and is there a way we can do something like that by injection medical experts and manufacturers were quick to point out that consuming those products can kill you in recent weeks accusations of quackery have been leveled against two of television s most famous doctors heart surgeon dr mehmet oz was criticized after hyping the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for covid 19 when the benefits are far from conclusive he has since reversed himself and dr phil mcgraw a former clinical psychologist incorrectly compared the disease s danger with other causes of death from automobile accidents and cigarettes to drownings in swimming pools he too backtracked while the peddlers of quack medicine may have mixed motives dr lydia kang said that the patients should always be treated with compassion a lot of it really just comes down to fear people don t want to be sick they re afraid of being sick they don t want to get worse and hope they want to get better and they ll look for whatever they can to do so read a book excerpt quackery on how radium acquired a glowing reputation as a
