this post is updated with trump s reaction rep justin amash s decision to form an exploratory committee for a run for president as the libertarian party candidate could wind up being a very significant moment in the 2020 race exactly why and how though isn t entirely clear amash has been toying with a third party run since a well documented rift between him and the republican party which he left symbolically on july 4 to become an independent amash who says he will now change his party affiliation to libertarian was a founding member of the tea party oriented house freedom caucus but his politics have always skewed more libertarian and he said he became frustrated with the gop over time he went on to support the impeachment of president trump even as all of his former party mates in the house voted against it the case for him being a significant presence in the 2020 race is readily apparent he s not just a sitting congressman and former republican but he also hails from one of the most important states in the 2020 election michigan the state went for trump by just 0 2 percentage points in 2016 the thinnest margin of any state that means even a modestly strong showing by a libertarian nominee could theoretically swing the state and potentially the race for presidency exactly to whose benefit could that accrue though being a former republican with conservative fiscal policies would seem to potentially attract gop leaning voters who are disillusioned with trump but perhaps unwilling to move over to the presumptive democratic nominee former vice president joe biden amash also represents one of 14 michigan congressional districts and a conservative leaning one at that with the district going for trump in 2016 by 10 points a relatively strong showing by third party standards in his home area could help him gain significant votes statewide libertarian nominee gary johnson himself a former republican governor took 3 6 percent in the state in 2016 but there are also plenty of reasons to believe that amash assuming he s not actually competing for a win could wind up helping trump a poll conducted in may by the detroit news for instance showed that biden led trump in michigan by 12 points in a head to head race 53 to 41 but adding amash to the equation reduced biden s margin by half with biden leading 45 to 39 and amash pulling a significant 10 percent amash also drew 16 percent of independent voters in that poll reducing biden s 13 point lead among them to a tie with trump that poll is from a long time ago and we regrettably don t have any more recent high quality polls testing an amash bid either in michigan or nationally so it s difficult to say that s how things stand today but there is other evidence that the presence of a formidable third party candidate more generally could accrue to trump s benefit one of my favorite poll numbers is how the double haters vote when trump was running against hillary clinton in 2016 each candidate was liked by only about 4 in 10 voters that made for a large universe of voters who didn t like either and those voters favored trump significantly and likely decisively as philip bump wrote earlier this month exit polls show they went for trump by 21 points in michigan 25 points in pennsylvania and 37 points in wisconsin way more than accounting for his slim margin in each state although those double haters went for trump in 2016 there is significant evidence that they favor biden this time around a quinnipiac poll this month showed they favored biden by 32 points nationally similar to his margin in december in the same poll the margin was about the same in a fox news poll in august too with these voters favoring biden 43 percent to 10 percent these are importantly small sample sizes that s because the universe of voters who dislike both major party candidates in 2020 is thus far smaller than it was in 2016 when we had two of the most unpopular nominees in modern history still biden s advantage among them is well documented and remarkably consistent across these polls and what they suggest is that voters who are disillusioned with both of their top options in 2020 are primed to help biden significantly and have very little interest in voting for trump giving them a formidable third option especially in a state such as michigan could logically mean that that costs biden more than trump trump seemed to welcome amash into the race in a tweet wednesday morning casting him as unable to win reelection to the house as an independent he also suggested he might hurt the democrats more than green party candidate jill stein did in 2016 it s of course difficult to take such musings about whether other candidates should run at face value no i think amash would make a wonderful candidate especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his congressional seat he almost always votes for the do nothing dems anyway i like him even more than jill stein https t co v8kutnfvij all of that said it s super early while casual voters might have heard of amash they probably don t know much about him besides his support for impeachment and his departure from the gop if he runs a serious campaign and people come to understand his platform and his tea party roots perhaps that would be more attractive to conservative voters who might otherwise support trump while the conventional wisdom is that trump s base is small but completely devoted to him polling has suggested there is some softness to it many supporters say trump isn t honest and trustworthy or say that he doesn t make them proud that he s president so even as many anti trump conservatives denounced amash s exploratory bid tuesday night as well intentioned but counterproductive it s difficult to say that with any certainty it s all a big what if at this point but what s abundantly clear is that it s something worth keeping an eye on president trump on
