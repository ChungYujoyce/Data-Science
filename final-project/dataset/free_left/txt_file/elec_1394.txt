 hours after stating his claim of obama as the founder of isil was sarcasm trump says maybe it wasn t by nolan d mccaskill 08 12 2016 06 36 am edt updated 08 12 2016 03 40 pm edt donald trump put his foot on the gas pedal again driving home the accusation he had reversed himself hours earlier that president barack obama founded the islamic state trump had eased off the claim friday morning blasting the media for seriously reporting what he suggested was a sarcastic comment ratings challenged cnn reports so seriously that i call president obama and clinton the founder of isis mvp trump tweeted they don t get sarcasm he seemed to revel in the uncertainty his tweet created boasting nearly 90 minutes later of pundits inability to figure him out i love watching these poor pathetic people pundits on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out they can t trump declared advertisement but during an afternoon rally in erie pennsylvania trump said his initial remark wasn t that sarcastic to be honest with you so i said the founder of isis trump recalled to the crowd after accusing the president of being so weak and so bad that he allowed the islamic state to grow obviously i m being sarcastic then but not that sarcastic to be honest with you the republican presidential nominee s swerving attempt at damage control came after doubling down if not tripling down on his founder claim thursday it also came ahead of what one person characterized as a come to jesus meeting between trump s campaign and republican party officials in orlando florida on friday morning as dozens of prominent members of the gop pressed the republican national committee to dump trump and redirect its funds downballot to save republican majorities in congress trump initially made the inflammatory comment during a wednesday evening rally in sunrise florida isis is honoring president obama he is the founder of isis trump said he is the founder of isis ok he s the founder he founded isis and i would say the co founder would be crooked hillary clinton but he didn t stop there the real estate mogul escalated his incendiary rhetoric multiple times on thursday including during a speech to the national association of home builders in miami our government isn t giving us good protection our government has unleashed isis he said i call president obama and hillary clinton the founders of isis they re the founders in fact i think we ll give hillary clinton the you know if you re on a sports team most valuable player mvp you get the mvp award isis will hand her the most valuable player award her only competition is barack obama trump s founder comment is just the latest in a series of seemingly never ending controversies that have erupted since he officially claimed the gop nomination in cleveland last month the list includes a verbal battle with a gold star family and more recently a provocative remark about second amendment people stopping clinton from appointing liberal supreme court justices his comments in miami followed telephone interviews with cnbc and conservative radio host hugh hewitt on thursday morning trump told squawk box that obama and clinton deserve the islamic state s most valuable player award and slammed shut the opening hewitt gave him to clarify his remarks i know what you meant you meant that he created the vacuum he lost the peace hewitt told trump to which trump responded no i meant he s the founder of isis i do former house speaker newt gingrich a top trump surrogate expressed frustration with trump s imprecise language and shorthand speaking style he sometimes uses three words when he needs 10 gingrich told fox news adding that had trump for example explained that obama and clinton s decision to pull out of iraq created the vacuum that allowed the emergence of the islamic state he d be 100 percent accurate when you instead comprise them into obama created isis i know what trump has in his mind but that s not what people hear he said he has got to learn to use language that has been thought through and that is clear to everybody and to stick to that language because otherwise the mainstream media is gonna take every possible excuse to pile on him massachusetts rep seth moulton a clinton supporter and iraq war veteran on friday cast trump as a clueless candidate with a hazardous temperament i mean what happens when he presses the nuclear button and then the next day says oh i m sorry i was just being sarcastic it s ridiculous that we re even talking about someone like this being our commander in chief and it s dangerous for our troops he told cnn s new day on friday but trump s camp came to his defense senior adviser sarah huckabee sanders pointed to the term founder as the point of sarcasm but maintained that the formation of the islamic state is a result of obama and clinton s failed policies and that can t be disputed isis didn t exist before the obama presidency she said on cnn although the islamic state s origins have been traced to before obama took the presidency in 2009 she also insisted that trump s intention was to bring the conversation to the fore of the campaign and he did i think the point that he s trying to make is the contrast that exists and he s trying to bring out a really important issue and make everybody talk about it and that s exactly what we re doing right now she said i bet that you guys will spend all day talking about whether or not obama played a role in the formation of isis trump special counsel michael cohen repeatedly declined to try to explain trump s rhetoric in a separate cnn interview insisting to chris cuomo that trump is the best person to clarify his remarks but he also said trump should be taken at his word for everything and eventually offered an explanation for his boss mr trump is claiming that you know president obama and secretary clinton are the founders of isis what he s referring to and he s talked about it so many times is of course the fact that isis grew and grew out of control and is now a threat to our national security cohen said trump also appeared to get a boost from rnc chairman reince preibus who introduced trump at his friday afternoon rally despite the raw relations between the nominee and his party after the conventions don t believe the garbage you read priebus said let me tell you something donald trump the republican party all of you we re gonna put him in the white house and save this country together missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico
