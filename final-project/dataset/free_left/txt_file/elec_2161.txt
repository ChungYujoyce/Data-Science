advertisement by jeremy w peters april 7 2015 senator rand paul of kentucky declared his candidacy for the 2016 republican presidential nomination on tuesday in louisville here is a look at what he will need to do if he hopes to win related article mr paul will try to put together a disparate coalition of voters the libertarian faithful who supported his father former representative ron paul in 2008 and 2012 tea party adherents drawn to his small government fiscal conservatism and some who are not even republicans like college students and blacks groups he has been wooing for a year and a half the question is whether the parts add up to a whole many of his father s supporters believe that mr paul has sold them out by trying too hard to appeal to mainstream republicans tea party conservatives could be peeled away by senator ted cruz of texas or gov scott walker of wisconsin and getting people who have never voted republican to do so is no small task especially when many caucuses and primaries are open only to registered republicans mr paul s viability will be judged on whether he can win one of the first four states with nominating contests iowa new hampshire nevada or south carolina he has a strong campaign operation in iowa but with such a crowded field there he may do better in new hampshire a libertarian leaning state where his father placed second in 2012 and the unaffiliated voters he is courting are free to cast primary ballots mr paul has also made inroads with libertarian activists in nevada another live and let live kind of place if mr paul who sees his wariness of american military intervention as one of his strongest assets wins the nomination and faces hillary rodham clinton it will be the rare presidential contest in which the republican is to the left of the democrat on foreign policy mr paul likes to say he is beholden to no party and he criticizes republicans almost as often as he does president obama both parties he says have led the country down a ruinous path that has deprived americans of their civil liberties and jeopardized future generations financial and personal security to younger less staunchly republican crowds he often says what you do on your cellphone is none of the government s damn business a line that sharply distinguishes him from his rivals to conservatives he laments the growth in federal spending and what he calls an unprecedented power grab by the obama administration in bypassing congress to issue regulations on everything from the environment to national security republican contenders generally argue either that they are the best equipped to safeguard conservatism mr cruz and mr walker or that they will help the party grow the most jeb bush mr paul will try to claim both his ideology is unusual enough that he can appeal to people across the political spectrum and with so many republicans splitting up the vote in the early going it is conceivable that his diverse coalition could prove just big enough mr paul s rivals portray him as trying to be too many things to too many different people and his efforts to sell himself as a new kind of republican may be complicated by his views on foreign aid he supported abolishing it altogether but then under pressure from the right carved out an exception for israel though jewish conservatives remain wary of him mr paul has tried to explain away such inconsistencies by insisting that the news media or his critics were twisting his words when in fact they were not his occasional testiness indeed suggests a temperament that may not wear well under the hot glare of a long campaign but his biggest problem could be republican foreign policy hawks like john bolton the former united nations ambassador who are mobilizing to make sure that mr paul whom they see as dangerously isolationist does not get very far advertisement
