senate president donald trump indistinct mister president i have good news what s the good news tell me i need good some news i got people trying to impeach me margaret brennan but most members of congress including speaker nancy pelosi don t see the impeachment battle as a laughing matter man do you hate the president madam speaker nancy pelosi and as catholic i resent your using the word hate in a sentence that addresses me i don t hate anyone i was raised in a way that is a heart full of love and always pray for the president and i still pray for the president i pray for the president all the time so don t mess with me when it comes to words like that margaret brennan we ll talk with the chairman of the intelligence committee adam schiff and we ll hear from a key defender of mister trump congressman mark meadows then the president s visit to london for a meeting of nato allies results in some awkward photo opens and embarrassing hot mic moments prompting the president to call one ally two faced plus a new threat from north korean leader kim jong un leads to the resurrection of an old nickname president donald trump we ll see what happens he likes sending rockets up doesn t he that s why i call him rocket man margaret brennan white house national security advisor robert o brien will weigh in on the renewed hostility all that and more is just ahead on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation tomorrow the house judiciary committee will hold another hearing as they write articles of impeachment against president trump democrats are hoping to move quickly with full house debate on the articles and a vote by the christmas holiday we begin this morning with the chairman of the house intelligence committee adam schiff he joins us from burbank good morning to you chairman representative adam schiff d california repadamschiff intelligence committee chairman good morning margaret brennan before we get to impeachment i want to ask you about this developing story out of pensacola florida where a member of the saudi military gunned down three americans wounded eight is there an indication of motive was this terrorism representative adam schiff we ve gotten an initial briefing on it and it really is too early to say we grieve obviously for the families of those who were lost and we re going to press saudi arabia to do a full investigation on their end even as we do one on ours and i wish the president of the united states rather than trying to speak for the saudi government were pressing the saudi government for answers but we re going to make sure that we not only get to the full truth here but also that we review whatever protocols we have in place for the selection of people that participate in these military training programs both here and abroad so that this kind of insider attack never occurs again margaret brennan and we ll be talking about that more with the national security adviser ahead on the program but i want to switch to impeachment with you there are already drafts of impeachment articles the chairman of the house judiciary committee jerry nadler has indicated that you could see abuse of power obstruction among them what are you looking for what should we expect these articles to be defined as representative adam schiff well we have weighed in all the chairs with chairman nadler and his staff as to what we think would be appropriate in this set of articles i can t go into those particular discussions but i can tell you as a former prosecutor it s always been you know my strategy in a charging decision and an impeachment in the house is essentially a charging decision to charge those that there is the strongest and most overwhelming evidence and not try to charge everything even though you could charge other things so that s my guiding philosophy there is overwhelming evidence that the president sought to coerce ukraine into interfering in our election essentially sought to cheat in our next election by getting a foreign government to weigh in that is a very serious business and it imperils our national security it s a gross abuse of his office and the president also deeply sought to obstruct the investigation into that wrongdoing and i think that is the gravamen of the offense here margaret brennan well you re going well your committee will be presenting evidence tomorrow before the house judiciary committee will you include evidence from the mueller report representative adam schiff well our committee will present what we investigated in the intelligence audio cut set of allegations audio cut but also the obstruction of congress it won t be our committee the intelligence committee presentation that would go to other issues like the mueller report that will be decision that chairman nadler will have to make margaret brennan but do you think that this should be broadened out beyond the issue of ukraine representative adam schiff well again i m not going to get to my internal discussions with my colleagues but i will say that i think we should focus on those issues that provide the greatest threat to the country and the president is engaged in a course of conduct that threatens the integrity of the next election threatens our national security by withholding military assistance to an ally at war to our detriment and conditioning other things like a desperately sought after white house audio cut for election and that is an ongoing threat to the country and one that simply can t wait margaret brennan well i i know republicans make the point that the aid was ultimately released but i want to ask you in your personal opinion you have seen all of this evidence are you actually not going to vote to impeach the president is there any chance that you wouldn t vote to impeach the president representative adam schiff well first of all margaret they released the aid because they got caught because a whistleblower blew the whistle because congress announced an investigation and only thereafter and almost immediately thereafter were they forced to release the aide so that s not much of a defense getting caught margaret brennan mm hm representative adam schiff but in terms of my own recommendations look i m going to see what articles come out of the judiciary committee deliberations i ll make my views known at that time but i will say this this is precisely the kind of conduct the founders were most concerned about when they provided the remedy of impeachment that is that a president of the united states would abuse his power to seek foreign intervention in our affairs and do so in a way that threatens the ordinary mechanism of removing a president and that is an election and you have all of those ingredients here and what s more you have a president who is continuing in the malicious conduct out on the white house lawn still saying he wants ukraine to help him in the next election with these sham investigations inviting other countries like china to do the same thing rudy giuliani even this week margaret brennan yeah representative adam schiff is in ukraine furthering this plot and so this is an ongoing clear and present danger to the integrity of our elections and our own national security margaret brennan well the president said yesterday that rudy giuliani is preparing a report that he is going to give to the attorney general and to congress what is the plan for this is rudy giuliani going to come in and testify under oath representative adam schiff well we have subpoenaed rudy giuliani for his records and he s refused to comply and refused to cooperate like so many other witnesses that have refused like pompeo margaret brennan but do you know what the president is talking about here representative adam schiff look i have little idea what the president is talking about except that the president is only too happy to have his personal attorney continue to seek foreign interference in the next election this is not something that started or ended with ukraine it began when the president invited russia to intervene in the last election it continued with the president trying to coerce ukraine to do it now and it is audio cut we feel we have to move forward and we simply can t wait for an election in which the president is seeking already to prejudice by foreign intervention margaret brennan you know in the three hundred page report that your committee put out it included some call logs including numbers related to congressman nunes and a journalists and there has been a lot of blowback on you having published this upon reflection should you have made that public representative adam schiff well absolutely and the blowback has only come from the the far right but look every investigator seeks phone records to corroborate sometimes to contradict a witnesses testimony and here we had testimony that the president charged rudy giuliani with carrying out this plot that he told ambassador volger volker and perry and sondland to talk to rudy margaret brennan mm hm representative adam schiff and in fact ambassador volker testified about talking to rudy and so naturally we wanted phone records to show they had those conversations and indeed they did margaret brennan yeah representative adam schiff but it s very important to point out margaret we did not subpoena devin nunes call records we did not subpoena any journalist s call records and that is simply false information being pushed by the president s allies but the fact that mister nunes margaret brennan mm hm representative adam schiff or giuliani or others show up in this scheme doesn t make them irrelevant doesn t give them a pass margaret brennan all right congressman thank you very much representative adam schiff thank you margaret brennan and i do want to explain to our viewers we are having a couple of technical issues you might have noticed there that s going to happen with a new set but our cbs news coverage of the house impeachment hearings will continue on this network tomorrow as well we ll be back in a moment tomorrow you should tune in to see norah o donnell cover the hearings you just heard chairman schiff describe stay with us we ll bring in congressman mark meadows announcements margaret brennan and we re back with the former chairman of the conservative house freedom caucus north carolina republican congressman mark meadows good morning representative mark meadows r north carolina repmarkmeadows good morning margaret brennan good to have you here representative mark meadows great to be here great set margaret brennan thank you representative mark meadows i tell you this is exciting margaret brennan you re christening it for us you just heard chairman schiff representative mark meadows sure margaret brennan lay out his case from your perspective is it inevitable that the house is going to impeach president trump representative mark meadows well i don t think it s inevitable if you follow the facts i heard chairman schiff lay out his talking points and that s very different than the facts and i think what we we need to understand is is right now and the president just highlighted this in a tweet within forty eight hours of the hearing that s happening in judiciary tomorrow we have the judiciary team changing the guidelines in the rules for what impeachment is all about after the nixon impeachment effort the congressional research service margaret brennan mm hm representative mark meadows put out guidelines and said this is what impeachment should be based on it s been updated now all of the sudden margaret brennan yeah representative mark meadows there s new found evidence by jerry nadler and his team it s because the facts are not supporting their argument margaret brennan but when i m asking you representative mark meadows yeah margaret brennan if you think it s inevitable that that s also political calculation do you think there will be a single republican defection to representative mark meadows i i don t see margaret brennan vote alongside representative mark meadows yeah margaret brennan to impeach the president representative mark meadows i don t want to speak for all my colleagues but based on my conversations with them i don t see a single republican defecting they ve looked at the facts they know where we are on this i think if anything there s more pressure on my democrat colleagues where instead of having just two defections we may have more than that coming up as the articles get voted on but inevitably they re going margaret brennan do you know that or you re just guessing that you re going to see more than two representative mark meadows well i said there s more pressure on them margaret brennan okay representative mark meadows and and i have talked to a number of my moderate democrat colleagues and and i know there are a few that are out there that are real concerned again i don t speak for republicans or democrats broadly margaret brennan mm hm representative mark meadows but i do have conversations bipartisan conversations on a regular basis margaret brennan one of the wildcards here representative mark meadows yeah margaret brennan is rudy giuliani representative mark meadows yeah margaret brennan the president s attorney he was in ukraine this week representative mark meadows right margaret brennan and you just heard chairman schiff say he he s not sure exactly what the president meant yesterday when he said that a report is going to be produced to congress and the attorney general by rudy giuliani representative mark meadows well i think if adam schiff wants to look at the evidence wouldn t he whether it comes from rudy giuliani or anybody else wouldn t he be happy margaret brennan so representative mark meadows to see any evidence of of foreign intervention in terms of the 2016 elections margaret brennan so i m sorry are are you saying you would trust any information rudy giuliani produces as credible representative mark meadows i i would trust any information that comes to congress to be able to be evaluated in a neutral manner so whether it comes from rudy giuliani or or some democrat witness that s there if they re bringing information margaret brennan yeah representative mark meadows congress has an obligation to look at it we have the oversight responsibility margaret brennan so representative mark meadows and so margaret brennan are you representative mark meadows let me let me just finish real quickly so if if he s getting relevant information that comes comes forth from ukraine i i think it s important for us to look at it so many times people have said listen ukrainians never got involved in the 2016 election well that s just not accurate because margaret brennan the issue around impeachment is about the upcoming election and joe biden one of your colleagues matt gaetz of florida who who s a fellow republican said it s weird for him to see rudy giuliani out there doing this representative mark meadows well i i m not suggesting that you margaret brennan do you think giuliani needs to come in under oath representative mark meadows well i i think that rudy giuliani if he s got evidence that s important to illuminate this should come in should testify i agree with that the the other aspect of this that is critically important that so many people are starting to look at they re they re trying to focus on rudy giuliani this impeachment is about withholding foreign aid and and rudy didn t have anything to do with that margaret brennan well he representative mark meadows actually none of the promises none of the the so so called interference in elections actually ever happened adam schiff just was on here just a few minutes margaret brennan rudy giuliani has has said on this program and elsewhere that joe biden needs to be investigated he he has propagated this idea that s at the center of it all as you know representative mark meadows right margaret brennan but one of the things the white house did this week was put out a letter saying it s not essentially going to participate representative mark meadows right margaret brennan in these upcoming hearings representative mark meadows right margaret brennan but then the president at the same time and and republicans like yourself say he s not getting a fair shake so how do you have it both ways of representative mark meadows well margaret brennan of not participating but then complaining about not being included representative mark meadows well listen if you can change the rules margaret i ll play any game with you no matter how talented you are if i get to control the rules i ll win every time and that s what the democrats margaret brennan that s what happens when you win the majority representative mark meadows but but no that s not because what we we have standards here and what happens is is i ve been in over a hundred hours of depositions i ve seen my democrat colleagues time and time again leak out what s favorable to them and not favorable to the president they ve done it over and over and over again that s not fair and should should the president participate in an unfair process absolutely not he ll get a fair process if it gets to the senate margaret brennan and you re saying it s not inevitable that that will happen representative mark meadows well i think it s probable but not inevitable margaret brennan okay i also want to ask you i know you care about government funding representative mark meadows yeah margaret brennan being fiscally responsible we are about two weeks out from a deadline here representative mark meadows yeah margaret brennan on running out of government funding do you see the chances where do you see the chances of a government shutdown can they be avoided representative mark meadows i i think it will be avoided i think i know the president wants to avoid it i believe based on what nancy pelosi says she wants to to avoid it here s what they re going to have to do though they re going to have to margaret brennan even without border wall funding representative mark meadows well nancy pelosi made an agreement not to go back when we increase the debt ceiling in the the previous budget deal she agreed to leave the funding there that is static and so what i would say a continuing resolution for those viewers that are out there continuing the funding as it is for three or four months while we get this impeachment effort off the agenda is certainly appropriate i think the president would sign that and believe my democrat colleagues would as well margaret brennan congressman good to have you here representative mark meadows thank you great to be here margaret brennan thank you coming up next we re going to switch gears talk about new threats to america with white house national security advisor robert o brien he is standing by don t go away announcements margaret brennan and we re back with white house national security adviser robert o brien good morning to you mister ambassador ambassador robert o brien national security adviser robertcobrien good morning margaret margaret brennan we saw overnight north korea conduct what it called a very important test in your view are they preparing to restart nuclear tests ambassador robert o brien i hope not that would be a mistake on the part of north korea when we came into office the the president was faced with a very difficult situation in north korea president obama told him it was the most dangerous problem he would face in the world through a combination of of tough sanctions and and a military show of forces we were able to convince kim jong un to to come to a a summit at that summit kim jong un promised to denuclearize north korea and we expect him to live up to the promise he made at the summit in singapore and and we hope he ll do so margaret brennan well his ambassador to the u n said yesterday denuclearization is already gone out of the negotiating table the president seemed to nod to that in a tweet this morning with this test and that statement it seems an explicit recognition here that on their end diplomacy is dead what s the u s going to do if they restart tests ambassador robert o brien well i i d be pretty nervous if i was that ambassador because kim jong un has said publicly that he will denuclearize north korean penin the penin korean peninsula for a north korean ambassador to take a contrary position to the to his leader i think in that circumstance is a is a pretty dangerous thing for him to do look we ll margaret brennan north korean diplomats don t usually freelance you know that ambassador robert o brien i know i well they they it doesn t end well for them if they do so i i m a little surprised by that comment by the the u n ambassador we ll have to see what happens we re we re continuing with our negotiations steve biegun is going down to the region soon and and we ll we ll we ll see what happens but we have plenty of tools in the toolkit if if north korea takes a different path than the one it s promised its people the people of south korea the united states and the world kim jong un said that he is going to denuclearize the korean peninsula if he does not do that then we ll take that into account and and we ve got plenty of tools in the toolkit margaret brennan well you ve got time running out though with this end of year deadline kim jong un has set do you expect to have the u s and north korea meet do you expect president trump to speak to kim jong un ambassador robert o brien well we ll we ll we ll see we d like to have continued negotiations we were in stockholm not too long ago for negotiations with the north korean team and we d like to continue those negotiations and and look we d like to see this end up in a peaceful resolution and a a resolution that that is good for the people of north korea they could be a great country they could have a a tremendous economic powerhouse in north korea instead of of starving and and being poor so they ve got to make a choice and and we hope they make the right choice margaret brennan i want to ask you about something here at home we saw a saudi military officer shoot dead three americans wound eight at a pensacola base was the shooter acting alone is this a terrorist attack ambassador robert o brien so we don t know yet if he was acting alone the fbi is investigating and they they re they ve been interviewing interrogating other saudi students look to me it appears to be a terrorist attack the fbi will have to get into the i i don t want to prejudge the investigation but it appears that this may be someone that was radicalized whether it was here or you know it s it s unclear if he s got any ties to any other organizations margaret brennan what do you mean appears ambassador robert o brien but it doesn t look good margaret brennan to be based on what obviously you re seeing intelligence that that we don t know about you have ambassador robert o brien well i margaret brennan credible intelligence that indicates that this might be part of a broader plot ambassador robert o brien i i i don t see anything that there that there s a broader plot i i m watching the same things that you re watching and and and the public reports and the this is a guy who who may very well have have said some things on twitter that suggest he was radicalized he went out and and killed a number of of americans so my point is it looks like terrorism we ll have to see what the fbi investigation shows what his motivations were the saudis have promised full cooperation with the investigation we re going to take them at their word and and the fbi is is very competent doing these things they ll get to the bottom of it and we ll have a full report but i m my point is it looks from what we re seeing in in the public reports that this looks like something that s terrorism or akin to terrorism margaret brennan yesterday there was a prisoner exchange with iran it s significant first time trump administration has got an american back from iran xiyue wang was the princeton scholar released and the u s also released an iranian scientist that s great for his family they have great joy but there are at least four other americans and i know you know this well who are still imprisoned in iran why not make this part of a package deal ambassador robert o brien well what what you find out in the hostage business margaret and i did this for for several years and we were able to to president trump s brought back more wrongfully detained americans that are hostages than any president in my lifetime and he s done it without paying concessions without the pallets of cash because we want to deter folks from taking hostages again in the future but what you do is you take the hostages and you take the detainees as as you can get them we would love to have all the iranian detainees back i i pressed very hard on the iranians for a year and a half to enter into a consular dialogue to meet with us to talk about how we could get all of them home and and we re continuing to do that and we want to see every one of those americans home i know each of the family members say these are great people they re great americans and and they love their family members we we had a great day yesterday for for the wang family margaret brennan yeah ambassador robert o brien has xi shou has a has a young wife he s got a young son who he hasn t seen for three years because the the iranians wrongfully detained him accused him of being a spy he wasn t he was a young scholar coming to study their language and study their history and they threw him in jail instead we got a great deal out of out of this they wanted a an iranian back who you can go to the doj for details on this but he was going to court next week and and we felt there was an opportunity here to to get get someone home and we did and we margaret brennan you said ambassador robert o brien took the advantage of that opportunity margaret brennan you say great deal does this provide an opening for direct talks with iran ambassador robert o brien look i hope so the president has offered to talk with the ayatollah and margaret brennan but no promise of that that was not a condition for this ambassador robert o brien well that was margaret brennan this is not a precondition to talk ambassador robert o brien no look we we ve had a maximum pressure campaign on iran i i think that maximum pressure campaign had an impact and and and and was in part responsible for this release the president has has offered to talk to the iranians without preconditions about a whole range of issues margaret brennan okay ambassador robert o brien we d like to sit down and talk to them but but the sanctions and the maximum pressure are not going to be let up until iran abandons its nuclear program or abandons its malign activities in the region in the meantime we d love to sit down with him and talk about the other detainees we want to get every single american home margaret brennan yeah ambassador robert o brien and there s there s no one more committed to bringing americans home than president trump and i margaret brennan okay ambassador robert o brien i think his record shows that margaret brennan all right ambassador o brien thank you very much for joining us we ll be back with much more on face the nation announcements margaret brennan some of our stations are leaving us now but we will be right back with a lot more face the nation so stay with us announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation neal katyal was acting solicitor general under president obama and he lays out the argument for removing president trump from office in his new book impeach the case against donald trump and neal is here with us in the studio now good to have you here neal katyal former acting solicitor general neal katyal impeach thank you for having me margaret brennan so obviously the title says it all in terms of where you are on this issue from what you heard from adam schiff the chairman of house intelligence and the argument he is laying out would you advise him to stay narrowly focused on ukraine or to include other things in these articles neal katyal so the book argues that it should be a narrow focus some of the other evidence can come in about mueller as kind of supporting evidence that s how the nixon precedent had it the articles of impeachment there focused on watergate but then it brought in some other things and here are the most important thing is not just ukraine but the president s reaction to ukraine i mean he s engaged in unprecedented obstruction no president in our history has ever done this saying margaret brennan what do you mean neal katyal unilaterally i don t have i declare the entire investigation illegitimate no witnesses no documents no president did that nixon contemplated it and even he backed down and if this president can do it and this is a central argument in my book every president can do it whether it was obama before and the president elizabeth warren or bernie sanders or whoever an impeachment is so central to our checks and balances and what he is doing is a fundamental threat to our constitution margaret brennan what do impeachment articles look like what what s a prudent selection neal katyal yes so in the book i lay out three articles one is abuse of power that he the president was trying to cheat in the 2020 election with the help of a foreign government using his commander in chief powers so it s different than 2016 when he was just a candidate saying russia are you listening and stuff like that margaret brennan republicans would say 2020 was never mentioned elections were never mentioned in that so called transcript neal katyal no but what was mentioned was his chief political rival joe biden and you know the idea that a president could go and withhold foreign aid in order to get an investigation announced not even completed margaret brennan mm hm neal katyal but announced by his adversary is something so pernicious so dangerous our founders madison hamilton would have cried at such a thought because it s such an abuse of the president s power so that s article i article ii would be bribery the quid pro quo engagement but you know the withholding of aid and the withholding of a white house meeting and then article iii would be is the obstruction of justice as we are talking about margaret brennan you would keep it on those three neal katyal i would margaret brennan you tweeted recently that you thought if if you go from impeachment in the house to a trial in the senate and and the senate doesn t essentially convict that you should retry with a new senate neal katyal mm hm margaret brennan after the elections i mean doesn t that sound more like a vendetta neal katyal so so certainly i didn t advocate that you should do it i was being descriptive not normative i said that there is no double jeopardy protection in our constitution and i was trying to use that margaret brennan you re just saying theoretically it is possible to do this neal katyal well what i am trying to say here is that the senate has an obligation to conduct a real trial and i suspect that they will conduct a real trial margaret brennan what does a real trial look like neal katyal like with with witnesses and subpoena power and so the president has stonewalled all of these witnesses john bolton mike pompeo acting chief of staff mulvaney all of those folks should testify in the senate they should be called and indeed donald trump should testify in the senate and so what s happened right now is the president has said i don t have to bother complying with any of this but in the senate in that real trial there will be subpoena procedures available and the democrats can call trump and i think that they should margaret brennan you call yourself an extreme centrist neal katyal mm hm margaret brennan but given your prior work people will say you re a democrat neal katyal mm hm margaret brennan the argument around this particular impeachment is that we are in this incredibly heated partisan moment at a degree the country hasn t at least recently withdrew neal katyal mm hm margaret brennan that there is no way to have a credible impeachment trial i mean that that argument is made all the time neal katyal mm hm margaret brennan that this was always going to be partisan and certainly the votes are are headed in that way do you agree with that i mean neal katyal not at all so two things first of all you know i think my obligation as a constitutional professor is to read each case on its own so i for example supported neil gorsuch trump s nominee to the supreme court and testified for him so you know i don t think you just view this through a partisan lens and number two i think we have to try i think this idea that americans are too weak this this bigotry of low expectations that we can t see facts anymore is so wrong that s why i wrote the book because i think if you give me thirty minutes with anyone i can convince them of how bad what trump did is for separation of powers and why he has to be removed and margaret brennan why don t you think the public or at least the polling that we have seen has the level of conviction that you do neal katyal because they haven t focused on the facts yet and the senate trial is the place it will be a formal solemn proceeding and as a litigator i have seen how trials change opinions margaret brennan but what does a trial look like i mean people think of law and order they think of courtroom dramas neal katyal mm hm margaret brennan they don t necessarily have a lot of precedent here i mean neal katyal right margaret brennan this is only really kind of the third maybe fourth time our country has done this neal katyal yeah well we ve had eighteen impeachments and some senate trial you know some senate trials margaret brennan of a president neal katyal not of presidents and so i think it looks like a real trial it looks like witnesses coming forward and arguments being made in the eyes of the nation margaret brennan do you really believe the republican controlled senate is going to subpoena john bolton or subpoena secretary of state pompeo neal katyal the democrats will have subpoena power and it will go to the chief justice and i ve had the privilege of arguing now thirty nine cases before the chief justice argument fortieth on wednesday and i think he is a consummately fair person and i think he will want this evidence out to the american public margaret brennan interesting and are you advising on this neal katyal no margaret brennan no neal katyal no no just did just through my writing margaret brennan just through your writing neal katyal yeah margaret brennan all right neal katyal thank you neal katyal thank you margaret brennan good luck with the book we ll be right back with our political panel announcements margaret brennan it s time now for some political analysis adam entous writes for the new yorker and is a brand new cbs news contributor welcome adam entous the new yorker adamentous thank you margaret brennan julie pace is the washington bureau chief at the associated press cbs news political correspondent ed o keefe is also with us and along with josh holmes a republican consultant and former chief of staff to senate leader mitch mcconnell josh welcome to the broadcast josh holmes republican consultant holmesjosh thank you good to be here margaret brennan i want to ask you you just heard neal katyal decide or describe what a senate trial could look like if the house goes ahead with impeaching the president does your version of what it looks like match his josh holmes no well there are a couple of details that probably worth going over the first is it s going to take fifty one votes in terms of calling witnesses i think neal suggested that basically the president of the united states could be called or subpoenaed to testify with with a a democratic wish list apparently unfortunately that s going to take that would take fifty one votes from republicans to to try to provide that and that s obviously not going to happen margaret brennan so when he is saying subpoena power there and you could see cabinet members come and answer questions josh holmes you could see all kinds of different things i think the most important thing to focus on there is that the the president is going to have his first capacity for an official defense in the senate and what that is is basically a witness list of their choosing that they will come to the senate with discuss both the contours and the length of how that trial is going to work and try to get republican buy in and and hopefully bipartisan buy in to process all of this but the idea that you can just sort of pull down whomever you want from a democratic point of view to come testify before the senate is not true margaret brennan well one of the witnesses that you hear in the white house and you hear republicans say they want to hear from is hunter biden and joe biden the current candidate i want to play a sound bite of joe biden on the campaign trail this week where he seemed to be punching back a bit begin vt man but you on the other hand sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company that he had no experience with gas or nothing in order to get access for the indistinct to for the president so you re you re selling access to the president just like he was so you joe biden you re a damn liar man that s not true and no one has ever said that no one man i didn t say you were doing anything wrong joe biden you said i set up my son to work in an oil company isn t that what you said get your words straight jack end vt margaret brennan get your words straight jack you you don t often hear joe biden hit back like that adam entous yeah margaret brennan is this a a tactic is this an honest moment adam entous i think it is an honest moment i mean i think this is the rawest issue for him anything that has to do with his son you know the time when when his son joined that board burisma the company in ukraine his other son beau was you know a year away from dying and it was just a very painful moment for the family and you know the policy that joe biden had with his son was kind of a don t ask don t tell hunter wouldn t talk to his dad about his business activities and his father wouldn t ask and so to have his son dragged into this is very hard for him because it wouldn t be happening if his father wasn t running for president and he knows also where his son is i mean he is i mean he is i m not even sure exactly how sober he is margaret brennan mm hm adam entous at times he struggled for years with his addictions and his dad knows that and during that period of time he was in a very bad place margaret brennan and you you spent a lot of time with hunter adam entous mm hm margaret brennan you have written about him and i know you ve said it s also painful because it was about the son who passed who was the one who reigned in hunter from some of his worst instincts adam entous right margaret brennan and he is not there adam entous right so when you know whenever hunter started drinking again it was beau that would take him to the airport so he could then fly to get treatment right it was always beau who was the one trying to save him and when you know during his last year of life hunter was just a wreck which is when this is all going on and so you can you know we saw in the impeachment hearing a one one state department official testified that he had concerns that he had raised with with members of biden s staff and was told that biden didn t have the bandwidth at that time to deal with it margaret brennan mm hm adam entous because he was still dealing with you know the death of the death of beau and so this has been consistent in joe biden s life this anything that has to do with his family anything that particularly since beau died that has to do with hunter is incredibly sensitive for him which is the reason why actually it it it s an effective margaret brennan yeah adam entous issue for republicans to push on but it s also you know it s something that maybe people watch and they can realize well this is a guy who actually really does care about his kids margaret brennan but the chances ed of joe or hunter biden coming and testifying ed o keefe cbs news political correspondent edokeefe well once again you need fifty one senators margaret brennan right ed o keefe to agree to do that margaret brennan and a lot of them don t want to do that ed o keefe exactly margaret brennan to a former colleague of theirs ed o keefe exactly exactly and so and and we ve heard from enough republicans or enough of them have inferred that that might be a bridge too far certainly other people involved they they would probably be fair game but the bidens less so and from a raw political standpoint his aides this week thought this was a fantastic moment for him because it showed fire in the belly it gave them it gave voters a sense of how he would respond to this if he was asked about the situation by either an opponent or by president trump clearly others thought this looked a little weird because in that exchange at one point it sounded like he called the man fat instead of jack you can listen to it yourself and decide and there were some other missteps and and misspoken words over the course of this nineteen stop bus tour that he made but it was called no malarkey and in that moment he certainly didn t want to take any of it and his aides think that it could help prove to voters if you ve got concerns about how he ll handle it that s how he ll handle it margaret brennan how he would handle a debate stage moment against president trump julie you saw kamala harris step out of the race this week is she a candidate to now go be the vp in the biden ticket if he gets a nomination julie pace the associated press jpacedc i think she certainly would have to be not just for joe biden but for any democratic nominee kamala harris has a really interesting background certainly her profile as as the highest profile black female politician in the country right now i do think one dynamic though between biden and harris to watch for is that dynamic from that first debate margaret brennan mm hm julie pace joe biden took that moment incredibly personally when kamala harris opened up her remarks by saying i don t think you re a racist but and part of the reason actually to get back to what we were talking about is that kamala harris and beau biden were very close when they were both attorney generals for delaware and and california you know politics is politics if he is the nominee and he thinks that kamala harris can help him win the presidency you can put a lot of hard feelings aside but that s certainly was a moment that really stuck with him for quite some time margaret brennan and josh when senator harris stepped back this week her retort to the president was i ll see you at your trial sir reminding everyone that she s a prosecutor and now she will be there for for that trial how much of the 2020 campaign time schedule is actually factoring into republican planning josh holmes yeah well you know she ll have no more or less role than any other senator in the body and i i think that underscores another challenge that a lot of these democratic 2020 candidates have here there are not as many senators as there were at the beginning but there still are a few elizabeth warren cory booker and others so the way you look at it is that they re going to have a closing argument going into the iowa caucuses is largely spent in washington dc talking about the impeachment trial of president trump so former campaign manager i can t imagine trying to manage a closing message to voters that you can t control it all margaret brennan mm hm josh holmes audio cut to the second third fourth week of january they literally are walking into an iowa caucus without even being in iowa margaret brennan and that might maybe factor into some thinking in republican leadership we could see not just the month of january but i mean how long is this going to last josh holmes well you never i mean the contours again are going to have to be set with fifty one votes and i i think the one thing that senate republican leadership is absolutely committed on doing and you saw pat cipollone and others come up to the hill and talk to republican senators about this is they want a full trial they want the president and his team to be able to provide a full witness list that they have the first kind of access to the american people to push back on the charges that adam schiff and others have brought so that could take a while but again i i think a lot of that is going to be determined by what the specific articles say and and i margaret brennan yeah josh holmes i didn t hear that from mister schiff this morning margaret brennan well we might know more by the end of this week we ll take a quick break here but i want to come more come back with more on the white house strategy and a lot a lot happened this week as always but we ll be right back with more from our panel announcements margaret brennan and we re back now with our political panel i i want to button up a few things on impeachment julie you heard president trump while he was overseas politics no longer stopping at the water s edge unload on adam schiff i mean he called him a deranged human being a maniac a very sick man this is someone who s trying to impeach him and in the process of writing the articles against him what is the white house strategy here julie pace i think white house strategy is to very quickly get through this house process and move on to the senate they basically have accepted the fact that the president is going to be pe impeached they want to move on to senate but i do think that there is a little clarity that needs to be brought to some of the white house officials about what this process actually looks like i mean josh was making this point this is not a situation where the republican senators are going to be out there on the senate floor actively able to defend the president this is going to be a process that s run by managers margaret brennan mm hm julie pace that has witnesses come forward so it s a little bit different than i think what the president has in mind right now but certainly they think that this is a better forum for them they think this is an opportunity to go on the offensive and bring forward people who might add to the picture that the president wants to paint which is of a democratic administration under a vice president joe biden who is engaged in corruption which is unproven so i do think it s a pretty high bar if you re the white house to try to push in that direction given the real lack of evidence that there is to bolster that case margaret brennan so this isn t going to look like your average courtroom drama julie pace this is not going to look like your average courtroom drama margaret brennan right adam rudy giuliani the word bold the word brazen has been used when i was talking to republicans about this decision of him to go to ukraine this week and to meet with individuals who are part of this entire impeachment proceeding is there a strategy there you know mark meadows on this program was saying he would he would look at the information that rudy giuliani brings back is that actually going to be introduced adam entous yeah i don t really know what the plan is for that i mean i did i did talk to somebody who traveled with giuliani on the trip and so that originally he was going to budapest to see lutsenko the former prosecutor general and then as a last minute they made a decision to go to see shokin his predecessor the former prosecutor general who was allegedly fired by biden allegedly again to protect his son his strategy is clearly just to kind of keep the the the you know keep keep fanning the flames of a you know you know innuendo half truths you know rumint that these ukrainians are giving him you know i i spent a lot of time there with some of these characters and you know they pretty bluntly told me that you know they are just feeding giuliani in many cases what he wants to hear margaret brennan mm hm adam entous giuliani is very eager to accept this information that he s getting he doesn t question it you know he is just trying to put it out there hoping that it will some of it will stick and you know his this is not that different from what was contained in the dossier that he provided to the to pompeo at the state department back in i think it was april or may margaret brennan that ended up with the inspector general adam entous correct which if you go through it carefully you realize it s it s just a lot of innuendo assumptions false information i mean there s some things in there that are true but most of it is is is not accurate margaret brennan i want to ask you ed about a key interview this week our own gayle king ed o keefe right margaret brennan sat down with mike bloomberg former mayor of new york for his first interview since he declared that he was going to run what did you make of of some of his give and take with her ed o keefe two two things stuck out the one that he got a lot of gut for right at the beginning was he was asked about comments that cory booker had made about the increasing lack of diversity now at the top tier of the democratic race and bloomberg sort of brushed it off and said well he supported me once he sat on my board he s well spoken and those are buzzwords for black and latino candidates minorities all across the country who ve heard too much of that booker called him out for it bloomberg apologized the more effective answer he had though was to the question about the fact that he s entering this race and basically bankrolling it on his own margaret brennan mm hm ed o keefe and he reiterated an argument he made when he ran for mayor which is i m paying for this on my own i won t accept a salary therefore i can t be bought everyone else is doing the same thing but they re asking other people for money and they ll owe somebody a favor at some point with me you don t have that you know who else made that argument donald trump julie pace trump ed o keefe and guess what it worked and who s mike bloomberg trying to win over the same kind of people who may go back and forth between both parties margaret brennan mm hm ed o keefe who probably voted for donald trump he s unloading sixty million dollars in tv and radio so far about five million across digital platforms if you re an american with a tvs or a a phone you have probably come across this now margaret brennan yeah ed o keefe in the last week and it w ill continue to happen and we will see probably right after the holidays whether it s sticking or whether he s struggling margaret brennan what what do you think his chances are of winning over some of the republicans i just talked about josh holmes well look i think you re only buying something if you get a product in the end and i i haven t seen any evidence that voters at this point have gravitated towards bloomberg and away from some of his democratic primary rivals but the idea that he s gravitating that any sort of voters in the center that has a right of center view is gravitating towards bloomberg i think it s way far afield at this point the the issues that define michael bloomberg in his post mayoral sort of activism category are all exclusively not only left of center but are almost litmus litmus tests in a conservative electorate but gun control you know banning soda i mean getting rid of coal his energy stances all margaret brennan he was a republican at one point josh holmes right it s pretty hard to make that case now and i think voters are are going to look at that in the context of a democratic primary and again it s going to be very very difficult for somebody like michael bloomberg to say he s an actual centrist margaret brennan that s brokered convention you hear rumored again and again julie what about the point cory booker made on on race this week he said for kamala harris that you know the democratic party essentially takes black women for granted in terms of voting what s going to happen with biden and his ability to to court the vote that that cory booker says isn t show up julie pace democrats are in this really interesting position right now because you have a you have a democratic electorate that is incredibly diverse and we have seen in election after election the power in particular of black women they have really delivered elections for democrats over and over again i do think the party is is recognizing that i don t think they are take being taken for granted but we ve had this historically diverse democratic field that is now at a point where the top frontrunners every candidate that has qualified for the next debate is margaret brennan okay julie pace white cory booker is trying to argue that the demo democratic party margaret brennan yeah julie pace indistinct for that that the rules are margaret brennan yeah julie pace sort of brokered against them right now but that is the reality of where we are margaret brennan we ll be right back
