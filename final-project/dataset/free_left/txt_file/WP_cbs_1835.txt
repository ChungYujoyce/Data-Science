a big win for him but a small increase in this crowded 2020 field hickenlooper has struggled to break out of the crowd endured acampaign shake upand repeated calls to run for the u s senate instead

last debate o rourke has seen a slip in polls and fundraising a campaign official tells cbs news that o rourke is hoping to connect with voters like he does on the ground and says that during the last round of debates he did not come across as himself aides say o rourke s goal heading into detroit is to convey a clear sense of who he is to voters our q can o rourke reclaim the momentum and

trackerindicated he has been for months engaged in debate with his fellow democrats the trump administration and general motors over the company s decision to shutter a factory in his district and eliminate roughly 1800 jobs ryan says it s an example of how he says the middle class has been getting screwed for the last 40 years and if there s any place for a pitch like that it s probably detroit our q with more than two dozen options to choose from will democratic voters find ryan compelling enough this week to get behind via cbs news campaign reporter cara korte sen bernie sanders did not have a moment in the first debate last month that might be a good thing seeing as the night s biggest moment was the contentious debate between joe biden and kamala harris sanders stayed out of the cross hairs but it demonstrates how different this election is for him as he no longer is sharing the spotlight with just one other opponent this week s debate will be even more challenging as he stands right beside his fellow progressive elizabeth warren forcing sanders to try to own his ideological turf our q at some point the two need to clearly differentiate themselves for waffling voters will tuesday be the night or could both candidates hesitate to look like the aggressor via cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak the massachusetts senator has been living by the slow and steady wins the race mantra never seeing a major surge but finally now polling ahead of everyone except joe biden in the last debate round the former law school professor must have felt as if she were back in a classroom she presented her ideas and then watched a group of lesser known candidates debate their own while dodging every opportunity to criticize hers warren often refers to her candidacy and goals as a fight at campaign stops but periodic volleys with mr trump aside warren has shown a striking ability to stay out of the fray bernie sanders with whom she will share the stage tuesday has absorbed many of the attacks on policies that warren also champions when sen michael bennett takes shots at plans for college debt forgiveness and eliminating private health insurance he calls them bernie s plan that could be because sanders introduced specific bills for those things but warren has called for equally progressive measures either way it illustrates the extent to which sanders has become the face of the progressive wing of the democratic party now warren and sanders will share a stage with her leading him in several polls if the past is any indication the two are likely to avoid criticizing one another our q will warren have to defend her progressive agenda in the same way sanders has via cbs news associate producer sarah ewall wice i just want to be myself said author

during the debate which is also where she was positioned during the first debates in june however not being center stage didn t hurt her during the first go round according to google williamson was
