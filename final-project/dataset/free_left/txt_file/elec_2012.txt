gop super pac s executive director invited about 50 top beltway lobbyists to his downtown washington office to make a plea for cash bliss walked the group through polling in top races and made the case that the gop is making late gains but the party s biggest hurdle is money he said bliss told the group that republicans are facing a green wave and that he s trying to raise another 20 million that would be in addition to adelson s latest contribution charlie black a longtime republican party hand who attended the breakfast said the problem isn t hard to diagnose democrats want to send a message to the president so they re pumping the war chests of house candidates with online donations we re raising more money than we usually do on our side and they re raising more than they ever do and it s because of trump black said he s the great motivator the national republican congressional committee is expected to secure a loan to help the party compete in the final weeks party officials

don t expect that to happen the rnc which is running an extensive national field campaign has already allocated its remaining funds for the rest of the election season according to two senior republicans elections by natasha korecki meanwhile a blame game is underway many republican lawmakers and strategists are frustrated with the nrcc over its failure to raise more money they said in interviews the committee has reserved 46 million on the tv airwaves compared with 64 million by their democratic counterpart a committee spokesman said the nrcc has eclipsed its fundraising record by 20 million this election cycle critics also contend that the house gop campaign arm has miscalculated by continuing to spend on behalf of rep barbara comstock a northern virginia republican who faces an uphill path to reelection the committee has reserved nearly 5 million in the pricey washington d c media market resources some argue that could be used to buttress other lawmakers with more realistic odds of winning nrcc officials insist comstock can still pull through this week in a show of solidarity with the congresswoman house speaker paul ryan r wis held a fundraiser for the congresswoman that brought in more than 300 000 the event drew an array of major gop figures including clinton era prosecutor ken starr other senior party officials however say fault lies with congressional leadership fund they argue that the group erred by spending millions of dollars on tv ads well before the fall campaign season kicked into gear when voters weren t as tuned in people close to the super pac however insist the commercials were critical in helping to define democratic candidates many of whom are seeking office for the first time when you re dealing with challengers they re generally unknown until late in the election cycle being able to define the race early is important when you re dealing with a challenging election climate said former rep mike ferguson r n j a lobbyist who attended the group s thursday morning breakfast you re going to be less at the mercy of the environment when time is running out critics also say the super pac has spent too much on its own national field program which has traditionally been handled by the rnc the investment has detracted from the amount it spends on tv commercials they say interactives by beatrice jin but people involved with the group say the total spent on field deployment has been relatively small and that it s made a difference in key races they also argue that clf has raised 100 million more this election cycle than in 2016 allowing it to spend more on get out the vote still the cash disparity with democrats is forcing republicans to do triage party officials the past several weeks have begun
