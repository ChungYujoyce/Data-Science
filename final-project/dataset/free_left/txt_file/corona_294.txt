school of journalism has found herself in some tight situations like being trapped in a hotel during a civil war in angola the experience she said was dicier than say staying inside a new york apartment to avoid a dangerous virus but there were some similarities too her new book how to drag a body and other safety tips you hope to never need won t be available until may but she recently shared some insights on surviving a lockdown the following interview is an edited and condensed version of the conversation a chapter in your book deals with how to survive in a bunker when you wrote this did you think new yorkers would be in this position i was thinking natural disasters were on the rise but i thought of them as being climate related i didn t think about sheltering for a pandemic what do you predict the next two weeks will be like this isn t like a tornado where you wait in the basement for it to blow over authorities are constantly revising and re evaluating their responses i think new york will do a version of what happened in california i would be stunned if we were not allowed to walk dogs or play soccer in the park the term shelter is making people alarmed it really means not congregating in large groups you shouldn t be going to a party with 20 people or getting a haircut have you ever had to live in a bunker i was holed up in a hotel in the early 1990s in angola south africa for a couple of weeks there was a civil war we didn t have running water we couldn t go outside my only link to the outside world was a satellite phone and it blew up after an electrical surge the other time i was stuck in a mountaintop in colombia researching a book the only way in and out was via helicopter i was sharing a small space with a bunch of soldiers i was there for a few days with bad army food the smell was disgusting and the space was claustrophobic what did you learn about yourself while holed up that i was more resilient and adaptive than i thought i was even the anxious new york human can adapt to an unusual situation how is a bunker different than staying put in a one bedroom apartment we are not in a bunker situation we have proper water and electricity we re living in well equipped spaces sheltering means right now you don t have freedom of movement you re spending most of your time here your world has been constricted to a very small living space you have a toilet you re not using a plastic bag with cat litter in it what are the five most important things outside of food that you need for survival in a new york apartment medicine a month s worth of prescriptions and over the counter items like allergy aspirin cold and flu imodium and an emergency first aid kit with gauze tape ointment for burns a tourniquet and plastic gloves each crisis has its own particulars the electricity is unlikely to fail in this situation that said it s always good to have spare batteries and flashlights in the house but i wouldn t start panicking and rushing out and getting them now if you don t already have them five thousand dollars in cash or look at your monthly budget and double that also something to amuse and distract yourself reading material videos board games a way to exercise in the house yoga resistance bands and weights we need a way to work off the stress put together all your financial documents in one place along with a contact list of everyone you might need to call in case of an emergency there should also be a point of contact person who knows all of your passwords right now my husband and i are revisiting our wills just in case what items are necessary to keep in your refrigerator and freezer stock up on meat fish vegetarian casseroles and ice cream long life cheese that can last a few months lots of root vegetables carrots brussels sprouts beets and turnips think russia those last a long time i don t wish spam upon anyone juice and milks with long shelf life do you believe in maintaining a daily routine absolutely you want a sense of control over your life and a routine helps you with that if you have a set schedule you have targets to move toward for people who are not used to working at home a lack of structure can be confusing right now what does your day consist of we wake up shower get dressed i don t sit around in sweats i want the feeling i m ready for work we are organized about meals which adds to the day s structure and we build in some time to exercise it gets us out of the house we go to the park or bike i also do something fun last night i did a group zoom call with friends we all had a cocktail together it s cheaper than a bar i make sure to connect with people at the end of the day and i try to go to bed at the same time that s very anchoring how important is it to keep up appearances it s crucial to feel put together if you look put together you feel more in control if you wear jewelry or makeup put that on each day dress in the same clothing you d be wearing if you went out socially what s the best way to get along with family members or roommates if you have enough room create designated space for each person the same as animals would eke out your own private territory communication is critical it s good for everyone to share the same routine so everyone is working on a similar clock updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities what s your best advice for those of us who live alone you have to maintain social contact develop a buddy system with people who you check in with daily and are your support system maybe have a friend stay with you i have a single friend who i walk with everyday so she knows that she has guaranteed social contact at least once a day do zoom or facetime where you can see each other anything that s visual is really important for connection a text can be impersonal send around jokes or funny emails or videos a way to break isolation is to do something altruistic for someone else like an elderly person in your building check up on them maybe see if they need anything that social connection makes you feel less cut off what are the signs of cabin fever what can you do about it feeling panic antsy claustrophobic that s when you have to leave the house and take a walk around the block or take deep breaths through the nose and then let it out slowly call a friend share how you re feeling cut down on your news consumption what is some personal advice you can share be careful not to binge tv because that can be an escape if certain people are making you anxious take a step back from them humor is important watch funny movies it s a nice way to round out the day is there a positive side to this this might revolutionize the american workplace if you ve always wanted to work off site when things go back to normal you could ask your boss about continuing to do so this could teach you to be more adaptive and creative and you might discover new interests as you try to fight the boredom reconnecting and turning to families i think is very positive this is also teaching us to think about what really matters advertisement
