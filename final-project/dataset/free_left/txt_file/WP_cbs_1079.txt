no matter where these victims come from this is a great tragedy which drew the attention of the international community to the issue of illegal immigration she said the international community should further strengthen cooperation in this area strengthen sharing of information and intelligence to prevent such tragedies from happening again hua said chinese authorities were also seeking information from police in belgium since the shipping container in which the bodies were found was sent to england from the belgian port of zeebrugge human smuggling from china is believed to have fallen drastically in recent years amid the country s rapidly growing domestic economy however some chinese particularly those with lesser education continue to be drawn to europe and north america by the promise of much higher wages than they can earn at home despite the considerable risks involved parts of china especially the southeastern province of fujian have long histories of sending migrants abroad the issue is a difficult one for china s ruling communist party which is intensely sensitive about china s international image and has staked much of its legitimacy to rule on improving living standards for the bulk of china s 1 4 billion people british police believe the truck and container took separate journeys before ending up at the industrial park in grays they say the container traveled by ferry from zeebrugge to purfleet england where it arrived early wednesday and was picked up by the truck driver and driven the few miles to grays the truck cab which is registered in bulgaria to a company owned by an irish woman is believed to have traveled from northern ireland to dublin where it caught a ferry to wales then drove across britain to pick up the container global trailer rentals ltd told ireland s national broadcaster rte the trailer it owns was leased oct 15 in county monaghan in ireland at a rate of 275 euros 299 per week the dublin based company said it will make the data from its tracking system available to investigators the company s directors told rte it was shell shocked at the news groups of migrants have repeatedly landed on english shores using small boats to make the risky channel crossing and migrants are sometimes found in the back of cars and trucks that disembark from the massive ferries that link france and england but wednesday s macabre find in an industrial park was a reminder that criminal gangs are still profiting from large scale trafficking the tragedy recalls the deaths of 58 chinese migrants who suffocated in a truck in dover england in 2000 after a perilous months long journey from china s southern fujian province they were found stowed with a cargo of tomatoes after a ferry ride from zeebrugge the same belgian
