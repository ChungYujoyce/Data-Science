years prompting concern beijing might use devaluation as a weapon in a tariff war with washington amid fading hopes for a trade deal the central bank blamed the exchange rate s decline on trade protectionism that followed president donald trump s threat last week of more tariff hikes on chinese goods in a bruising fight over beijing s trade surplus and technology policies mr trump early monday rebuked china for letting its currency sink suggesting that the country is manipulating the value of its currency china dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low it s called currency manipulation are you listening federal reserve this is a major violation which will greatly weaken china over time u s financial markets fell sharply on monday amid the signs of deteriorating relations between the u s and china in early trade the dow tumbled more than 500 points or 1 8 while the s p 500 fell 1 8 the nasdaq index which lists many technology companies that do business in china saw an even bigger drop as of 10 02 a m eastern time it was down more than 200 points or 2 5 to 7 799 points the fact that they have now stopped defending 7 against the dollar suggests that they have all but abandoned hopes for a trade deal with the u s julian evans pritchard senior china economist with capital economics told clients in a report the currency weakened to 7 0391 to the dollar by late afternoon making one yuan worth 14 2 cents its lowest level since february 2008 the thought of a currency war is crossing more than a few traders minds stephen innes of vm markets said in a report the weakness of the yuan also known as the renminbi or people s money is among u s grievances against beijing american officials complain it makes chinese export prices unfairly low hurting foreign competitors and swelling beijing s trade surplus further weakening of the yuan means that globally the pressure for the u s dollar to strengthen is rising louis kuijs of oxford economics said in a research note such dollar strength will be unwelcome in washington d c where president trump has openly complained about a strong dollar and has threatened to try to weaken the u s currency china s central bank sets the exchange rate each morning and allows the yuan to fluctuate by 2 against the dollar during the day the central bank can buy or sell currency or order commercial banks to do so to dampen price movements it appears the currency is now also considered part of the arsenal to be drawn upon robert carnell of ing said in a report he said monday s move might be part of a concerted series of steps aimed at pushing back at the latest u s tariffs the level of seven yuan to the dollar has no economic significance but could revive u s attention to the exchange rate until now economists said the potential jolt to financial markets of falling beyond that level was big enough that the people s bank of china would step in to put a floor under the
