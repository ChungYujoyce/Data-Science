symptoms crew members were expected to start leaving this weekend on saturday the health minister admitted that 23 passengers had been released from the ship without taking a valid recent test and had traveled by public transit after disembarking this past week now that the quarantine has ended and most of the passengers have left the concern is that they could start spreading the virus on shore japanese officials said they did the best they could in a fast moving situation as they tried to keep the virus from spreading within the country after confirming the first cases among those on board the authorities said they moved to isolate passengers to reduce transmission the government has said the quarantine was largely effective the ship operator princess cruises said japanese authorities took the lead in testing and protocols it added that the focus has been and remains the safety health and well being of our guests and crew in the early hours of feb 2 before the ship had even docked

the ship s lockdown deck 14 passenger cabins deck 14 passenger cabins there was the buffet on deck 14 where guests were urged to wash their hands before joining the line though hygiene habits varied widely some passengers recalled now they wondered why the buffet had remained open even after the ship s officers learned about the infected guest memories of art auctions afternoon high teas quiz nights and mahjong games all took on a sinister hue everything looks tainted in retrospect said sarah arana 52 a medical social worker from paso robles calif who left on an american evacuation flight

mystery on a cruise dwelled on the ship s last stop in naha the capital of okinawa as people disembarked public health officials took their temperatures a measure that was becoming more commonplace as the virus spiraled in china looking back ms courter wondered if the coronavirus had already started to spread with her husband philip and a group of friends she ate noodles and fried sweet potatoes at an outdoor stall in my heart i regret doing that she said because it was such a crowded place and there were people from the ship crawling around the town each day more cases emerged 10 another 10 then a spike of 41 what distressed passengers most was a sense that information was being withheld hours would pass between when the health ministry leaked new cases to the media and the people on board were notified passengers took to counting ambulances lined up on the pier to guess how many new infections would be announced that day japanese guests hung banners off balconies with one reading serious lack of medicine lack of information policies and protocols shifted as the quarantine wore on on the second day health officials began letting those in windowless cabins out for fresh air breaks it wasn t until the next day that passengers were warned to keep more than six feet away from anyone else mr torres a nurse who has since evacuated with his wife noticed that others were not always vigilant about wearing masks on deck on the fifth day passengers were issued heavy duty n95 masks and advised to wear them when they opened their doors to accept deliveries of meals and amenities from the crew halfway into the quarantine the japanese government announced that some people would be eligible to continue their confinement onshore those 80 or older with underlying medical conditions or windowless cabins the changes didn t inspire confidence passengers were waiting days for prescriptions to be filled for chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure people were running out of toothpaste and clean underwear tadashi chida a passenger in his 70s sent a handwritten letter to japan s health ministry complaining that the crew seemed overwhelmed and that quarantine officers were not attending to those with symptoms the ship is out of control mr chida said adding that his wife had waited nearly a week for medication an outbreak is happening he said we have no road maps yoshihide suga the chief cabinet secretary to prime minister shinzo abe said this past week that the country s authorities had made the maximum consideration to secure the health of passengers and crew at first health officials didn t test everyone saying they lacked the resources instead they focused on high risk individuals those who had direct contact with the infected passenger and later older and symptomatic people some passengers had trouble getting medical attention even when they started to show possible symptoms on the first full day of the quarantine carol montgomery 67 a retired administrative assistant from san clemente calif called the infirmary saying she had a fever and wanted to be tested she was told that it was up to the japanese health ministry and that no tests were available on board after a day passed her husband john called the u s embassy in tokyo and tried to convince an official that everybody needed to be tested we re in a petri dish mr montgomery said it s an experiment we re their guinea pigs ms montgomery eventually persuaded the ship s medical office to let the couple leave their cabin for an exam a doctor gave them flu tests which came back negative the doctor prescribed an antibiotic for ms montgomery s urinary tract infection they still did not get tested for the coronavirus the couple later evacuated with the americans john haering a retired railway operations manager from tooele utah called the medical office when his temperature rose sharply he was told that if it wasn t an emergency he would have to wait at one point someone came to the door with a clipboard he said asked for his temperature and left inside the cabin he shared with his wife mr haering 63 sweated it out taking cold showers and swallowing the last of their tylenol supply as his temperature climbed to 104 degrees fahrenheit four days later after his fever had broken officials in hazmat suits showed up at the couple s door ordered mr haering to pack a bag and loaded him into an ambulance leaving his wife on the ship the next day a doctor at a hospital about 40 miles from the port told him he had tested positive for the virus he remains in the hospital while his wife melanie is now in quarantine on a u s military base through it all crew members were working overtime sometimes as long as 13 hour shifts they prepared and delivered meals three times a day to 1 500 staterooms they dropped off towels bedsheets and extra treats for guests sudoku puzzles origami papers beauty masks and on valentine s day chocolates the crew members who numbered 1 045 had to remain on the job even as they faced the greatest risk of infection all told 85 crew members have tested positive for the virus updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities below deck they shared close quarters with as many as four to a bathroom they ate their own meals buffet style most crew members stayed on decks 2 and 3 most crew members stayed on decks 2 and 3 they manned phone lines as frantic guests called looking for answers to endless questions they swabbed the decks and guardrails after each fresh air break for passengers they did guests laundry for certain tasks they did not wear gloves and they reused face masks for more than the recommended day there were also new duties guarding the hallways at night to ensure that passengers didn t leave their rooms when infected passengers were sent to hospitals crew members had to carry their luggage the emotional psychological and physical stress that we are going through now is really hard said a woman who worked in the kitchens speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing her job she has since tested positive for the virus even after some crew members came down with a fever they continued to share rooms with other workers my cabin mate is staying with me said one person on the housekeeping staff who was consigned to his room when he developed a fever but he is working what s the point of isolation he asked we are stuck in a box which is already contaminated the virus has also ravaged public health officials who knew they were walking onto a contaminated ship hundreds of these officials many of them bureaucrats with little experience in managing infectious diseases helped with screenings and administrative tasks some did not wear full protective gear and six contracted the virus health ministry officials reluctantly allowed kentaro iwata an infectious disease specialist onto the ship late in the quarantine dr iwata was alarmed by the lack of control measures even among the medical staff in videos he posted on youtube he said he had observed a nurse at the ship s medical center receiving ill crew members without wearing a mask she said she was already infected and so she was completely giving up he said in the videos he took down his youtube posts after coming under criticism for violating the chain of command on the ship to pass the time in captivity passengers spent long hours streaming movies or posting on social media they did calisthenics and watched the onboard magician perform tricks on closed circuit television as the infections continued to mount boredom turned to fear on private facebook groups passengers said they were desperate to leave with their families using the hashtag getthemoffthatboat they questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine fretting that the virus could pass between rooms through the ventilation system after american passengers raised concerns with the embassy an official at the centers for disease control and prevention wrote that there was no current evidence to suggest that the virus spreads between rooms on a ship through the air handling system the best course the official said was for passengers to wait out the quarantine in their rooms a week and a half later american officials reversed their position the u s government announced that it was evacuating them before the end of the quarantine and would confine them for an additional 14 days on bases in california and texas a letter to american passengers said that the department of health and human services made an assessment that passengers and crew members onboard are at high risk of exposure the evacuation turned problematic while the 328 passengers and crew members were on their way to the airport in tokyo american officials learned from japanese health authorities that 14 of them had tested positive for the coronavirus they waited for hours on the tarmac as c d c experts debated with officials from the state department and the department of health and human services about what to do it took so long that some passengers had to get off and urinate against the side of the buses officials from the state department and the department of health and human services ultimately decided to take them all they put the infected at the back separating them on two planes with only 10 foot plastic sheeting and tape as the passengers boarded ms courter was standing next to a woman as she was being told she had tested positive we were less than three feet away ms courter said and i remember thinking i just spent two weeks to avoid anyone who is positive and now here is one breathing right in front of me other countries followed the lead of the united states in organizing charter flights for their citizens and new 14 day quarantines still that left many to just walk off the ship at the end of the quarantine in yokohama including a large number of japanese passengers who made up half of those on board the night of feb 18 the health ministry began clearing passengers to leave giving all certificates saying they had tested negative for the coronavirus and posed no risk of infection nearly 1 000 walked free over the next three days some boarding city buses others climbing into taxis experts have questioned whether those passengers truly pose no risk to the general public some could develop symptoms later after having tested negative just two days after leaving the ship on wednesday with a negative test result a woman in her 60s developed a fever and tested positive for coronavirus on saturday the day after news emerged that the 14 passengers who had tested positive were being flown to the united states president trump was furious said two american officials the decision to fly them into the country had taken him by surprise on thursday linda tsukamoto 63 a retired retail manager from marina del rey calif who decided not to take one of the american flights was released from the ship she will not be allowed back into the united states for at least another two weeks so she checked into a hotel in tokyo she said that hotel staff members were wearing masks and that there were signs warning guests of the risk of the coronavirus i will stay in most of the time she said to stay safe after this long journey reporting was contributed by eimi yamamitsu makiko inoue and hisako ueno from tokyo ben dooley and edward wong from washington and elaine yu from hong kong
