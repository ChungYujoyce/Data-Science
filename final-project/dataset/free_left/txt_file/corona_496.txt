said schools need to start thinking about what to do in the event of a local outbreak with the virus spreading to countries outside china it appears to have breached containment efforts and will almost certainly spread in the united states at some point officials said a solano county resident tested positive for the virus officials announced wednesday marking the first case in the country from an unknown source the fairfield suisin unified school district which is in solano county notified parents that because of the new case staff will be disinfecting surfaces on a daily basis a recommendation made by county and state officials to try to prevent the spread of the virus while this may be alarming and cause fear we want to assure you that fsusd is taking precautions to keep our school sites disinfected and clean officials said in a statement our staff will wipe down commonly shared surfaces every day with disinfectants the state is also recommending students and staff to frequently wash their hands cover their nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing and stay home if they are sick officials can also consider canceling special events like school dances plays or other large gatherings but with the virus likely to spread across communities closing schools holding classes in smaller groups or remote education via the internet are all possibilities said dr nancy messonnier director of the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases i understand this whole situation may seem overwhelming and that disruption to everyday life may be severe she said but these are things that people need to start thinking about now according to the center for disease control in a 2017 advisory regarding a flu pandemic closing schools preemptively before flu becomes widespread in schools and communities can help slow the spread of disease in the community in addition officials might close certain schools if many staff and students are sick and regular school functions cannot be maintained parents also need to start considering what to do if schools are closed or classes are held remotely in their community messonnier added i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said you should think about what you would do for childcare if schools or day cares close while many children in china are attending school remotely most schools in the bay area or across the country wouldn t be able to conduct classes online given a lack of computer or internet access for many students such widespread school closures are not unprecedented with many bay area schools shutting down
