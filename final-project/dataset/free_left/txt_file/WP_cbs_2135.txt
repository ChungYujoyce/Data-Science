watch cbsn live by stephen gandel april 29 2020 2 23 pm moneywatch the trump administration has closed several gaping loopholes in acoronavirusrelief program for small businesses that let hundreds of larger companies stake claims on the federal loans yet gaps remain heightening concerns that main street could be shut out even in this second round of relief demand for the forgivable low interestloans through the paycheck protection program remains intense especially once the money started flowing again on monday after congress injected another 310 billion in funding but bigger players including publicly traded companies can still access the ppp funds examples include the government issued guidance last week that stitched up some of the loopholes that larger companies used to obtain small business aid under the paycheck protection program the biggest change had to do with publicly traded companies according to an analysis of public documents by cbs news 230 public companies borrowed a total of nearly 800 million from the nearly 350 billion first round of ppp funding on thursday the treasury department discouraged additional public companies from seeking the loans and encouraged some companies that had already gotten loans to return them as of monday 17 public companies had announced they were giving back nearly 115 million in ppp loans according to the cbs news analysis thelos angeles lakersof the nba also said it would return its nearly 5 million ppp loan the treasury department said ppp loan borrowers must certify that they can t get money elsewhere that standard applies retroactively to any organization that has received funds it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith the treasury s latest guidance states another significant loophole the government closed relates to hedge funds and private equity firms the original ppp loan legislation made it clear that banks and other financial firms including investment companies were barred from tapping the program still some hedge funds reportedly asked banks if they were eligible for the program on friday the small business administration clarified that the money managers to rich individuals and institutions as well as private equity firms are ineligible for the ppp despite these moves to preserve ppp funds for small businesses loopholes remain we re frustrated said jeff hauser a government watchdog who is the founder and head of the revolving door project we remain unconvinced that ppp operating through the sba and treasury is a better fit than operating through the irs and invoking something along the lines of what other countries have been doing the treasury department has left the biggest loophole wide open hotel and restaurant chains no matter how big they are cumulatively remain eligible for ppp loans for their individual locations with fewer than 500 workers the justification is that the hospitality industry has been particularly damaged by the coronavirus s impact on the economy that s true vacancy rates of around 90 have been common at hotels around the country since the coronavirus shutdown but the public backlash has caused some hotel and restaurant chains to return their ppp loans not all however the red lion hotel chain received 4 3 million in small business aid it has 1 000 locations most of them operating as franchises over the weekend cbs moneywatch reported that monty bennett whose ashford hotel management chain and related entities oversee 130 hotel properties planned to not only keep the more than 60 million he had already received from the small business program but was continuing to pursue another 66 million in ppp loans in the second tranche bennett said his company basically has no income would be shut out of a separate federal reserve assistance program for other businesses its size and that it would have trouble borrowing elsewhere president donald trump has repeatedly berated companies that moved u s manufacturing jobs to other countries but the paycheck protection program actually makes it easier for some companies that have moved jobs overseas to get aid and they are not always small companies culp the largest domestic manufacturer of fabric for mattresses and other furniture has nearly 1 500 employees that would appear to size the company out of paycheck protection program funds yet the company landed a 7 6 million loan the loophole many of culp s employees are no longer in the u s two decades ago the high point north carolina based company made nearly all of its products in the u s but since the late 1990s it has moved much of its production overseas culp now has manufacturing facilities in vietnam and haiti the ppp only counts a company s u s employees when considering eligibility which is what appears to have made culp eligible for the program in its latest financial filing the company said only about a third of its 500 employees in its upholstery division are in the u s the rest are in china the company doesn t disclose its overall u s based workforce and culp did not return cbs moneywatch s request for comment companies may only apply for a loan to cover the salaries of their u s employees but culp got close to the 10 million maximum most borrowers are eligible to receive the company announced worker furloughs on april 3 the same day the ppp loan program began accepting applications but did not say how many employees were impacted the program is generally available to companies with 500 or fewer employees but a number of industries got exceptions to that ceiling ammunition manufacturers for instance can have as many as 1 500 u s workers and still qualify for ppp funding such exceptions are allowed under normal sba loan eligibility rules which were adopted long before the paycheck program protection s launch it s not clear why the exceptions exist but at least some are incorporated in sba rules to promote industries like manufacturing that had been shrinking in the u s other industries have exceptions that are less obvious such as soft drink bottlers like the kombucha seller new age beverages the include additional reporting by cbs news megan towey first published on april 29 2020 11 02 am 2020 cbs interactive inc all
