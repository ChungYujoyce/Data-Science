the president prefers to be surrounded by sycophants president donald trump says he s willing to help blue state governors who are struggling to contain coronavirus outbreaks but only if they re willing to stop criticizing him in exchange it s a two way street trump told fox news on tuesday they have to treat us well also they can t say oh gee we should get this we should get that trump s comments came as andrew cuomo the democratic governor of new york the state currently at the heart of america s coronavirus outbreak pleaded with trump to do more to provide his state and others with medical gear and ventilators trump s line seems to be that cuomo isn t in a position to make demands unless he refrains from criticizing the federal government and by extension him on governors asking for help trump says it s a two way street they have to treat us well too realized i had wrong clip before pic twitter com gxm83tcuzr when trump isn t attacking democratic governors already this month he s described michigan gov gretchen whitmer as failing accused illinois gov j b pritzker of blaming the federal government for his own shortcomings and smeared washington gov jay inslee as a snake the president has been insisting that it s up to them to procure the supplies they need to prevent their hospitals from being overwhelmed they have to get that gear themselves trump told fox news on tuesday referring to democratic governors adding that they shouldn t be hitting us it s worth noting that trump hasn t criticized republican governors for their coronavirus responses but telling the states to fend for themselves isn t really viable insofar as trump s goal is to save lives not score political points on tuesday the washington post detailed how a mad scramble for masks gowns and ventilators is pitting states against each other and driving up prices for that reason governors like cuomo and health care officials are begging trump to take a more active approach in procuring equipment whether it be on the open market or as a result of forcing private companies to do it with the defense production act he s been so reluctant to use during a news conference on tuesday cuomo said he can t for the life of me understand the reluctance to use the defense production act adding that the ventilators he s demanding from the federal government will make the difference between life and death literally for coronavirus patients in new york cuomo seems to understand the game trump is playing on monday the post reported that the governor is avoiding criticism of president trump and the federal government s response to the outbreak in a bid to get what he wants along those lines even as he was criticizing the federal government s response on tuesday cuomo refrained from taking aim directly at the president yet even cuomo s indirect criticisms were enough to rankle trump he subsequently told fox news that he watched governor cuomo during his news conference on tuesday and noted that he was complaining he was talking about the ventilator he should ve ordered the ventilators trump added he s supposed to be buying his own ventilators trump is now attacking andrew cuomo for saying the federal government should do more to provide new york with needed medical gear pic twitter com qpgd6diwm1 later with a smirk on his face trump apparently still perturbed by cuomo s comments went as far as to try blaming the governor for the number of coronavirus cases in his state do you blame the governor for that with a smug smirk on his face trump tries to pin blame for new york s coronavirus outbreak on gov cuomo because he allowed people to travel from asia back to new york city during the holidays pic twitter com 6syutlbwdb trump s equivocation about providing federal help to blue states reveals how he views the world in transactional terms he doesn t think of himself as obligated to do anything for people he doesn t view as part of his team unless he gets something in return like investigating the bidens in the case of the ukraine scandal that led to his impeachment or refraining from criticizing his government in the case of cuomo that might be a viable way of thinking in the rough and tumble world of new york real estate but it s a bad fit for roles of authority where you re supposedly duty bound to help everyone not just your supporters but even with american lives on the line this particular president can t seem to help himself the news moves fast to stay updated follow aaron rupar on twitter and read more of vox s policy and politics coverage get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
