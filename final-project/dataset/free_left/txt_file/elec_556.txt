and the man was released hillary clinton and mr trump used the final saturday before election day to make their closing pitches to voters with mrs clinton in south florida and philadelphia and mr trump dashing to four states across three time zones the sort of barnstorming tours presidential candidates have traditionally made in the last 72 hours before election day except there is no such thing as election day any longer more than 33 million americans had already voted by friday and there are signs from these early returns including high turnout among hispanic voters in key states that could be cause for concern for the trump campaign here is a look at what s happening in the campaign during the final weekend republicans have been worried that mr trump s hard line on immigration will turn off hispanic voters and early signs suggest that their fears are justified in florida at least 200 000 more hispanics had voted early as of friday than did during the entire early voting period four years ago according to an analysis by steve schale a democratic strategist who helped run president obama s two campaigns here nevada another crucial battleground is proving to be a similar story according to jon ralston a political analyst for ktnv high turnout from latinos and democrats in the state s crucial clark county is a bad omen for republicans democrats outpaced republicans in clark county by 11 000 votes cast on friday mr ralston reported giving mrs clinton a larger firewall than mr obama had in the state when he won by seven points in 2012 with eight days until the general election more than 22 million people have already voted through absentee ballots and early voting mrs clinton s afternoon rally in pembroke pines fla an increasingly diverse community in broward county was aimed at inspiring the region s mix of hispanic black caribbean and jewish voters to cast early ballots but a driving rain diverted mrs clinton from her script and revealed a happy warrior rarely seen on the campaign trail here s what i want you to remember she told the crowd i want to be the president for everybody everybody who agrees with me people who don t agree with me people who will vote for me people who don t vote for me the new york times s michael barbaro described the scene as a moment with an unfamiliar sense of abandon and joy with mrs clinton smiling widely and waving her arms as the rain drenched her for most of mr trump s rally in tampa fla he stuck to his favorite lines of attack warning that mrs clinton would pillage the pocketbooks of regular americans and work to enrich her cronies but amid promises to build a wall along the southern border and a vow to take on the islamic state mr trump showed that even he had a soft spot when it came to babies oh look a future construction worker mr trump said pointing to an infant in the crowd look look at that baby he s so cute oh give me that mr trump carried the baby to his lectern then he raised the child high and kissed both cheeks that is a great beautiful baby mr trump said to cheers he then handed the baby to one of his security guards and let out a sigh it was time to get back to talking about terrorism watch it here with mr trump hundreds of miles away in north carolina a rare glimpse of party unity was on display in mukwonago wis where speaker paul d ryan joined mr trump s running mate gov mike pence of indiana for a rally in mr ryan s home state while mr ryan has generally steered clear of the trump campaign in recent weeks he recently acknowledged that he had voted for mr trump along with all of the other republicans on the ballot on saturday he was more vociferous in his support of the nominee promising to work with him to repeal the affordable care act when donald trump says that he wants a special session to repeal and replace obamacare let me tell you that as speaker of the house we are ready we are willing and we have a plan to do that mr ryan said the relationship between mr ryan and mr trump remains frosty but it was clear that the highest ranking republican in congress felt genuine affection for mr pence as a kindred conservative spirit i have seen this man when no one is watching this man be a man of courage of integrity mr ryan said he is from the heart of the conservative movement the campaigns are keeping their schedules fluid in the race s final days shifting plans and dispatching surrogates as polls and early voting returns trickle in mr trump said on saturday that he would make a stop in minnesota before election day and mr pence is expected to do the same whether the trip to the traditionally blue state is a sign of an expanding map or a shrinking one for mr trump remains to be seen meanwhile mrs clinton is extending her strategy of trying to turn free concerts into votes on sunday she will return to new hampshire to campaign in manchester with the grammy winning singer james taylor no state has been so tempting yet so elusive for republicans as pennsylvania mitt romney made a last minute trip there four years ago when it was clear that he needed to find an alternate path to 270 electoral votes and mr trump has refused to give up on it even though every public poll shows that he s losing there he was there on friday rallying voters in hershey in the central part of the state that has kept mr trump somewhat competitive yet pennsylvania elections are typically won and lost in the heavily populated philadelphia region mrs clinton has been dominant there in the polls benefiting from the mix of suburban moderates and liberal city voters but there is no in person early voting in the state so data obsessed democrats are somewhat uneasy about where they actually stand in particular they are concerned that turnout among millennials and african americans may taper off from mr obama s two wins the solution mrs clinton plans to visit philadelphia twice in the campaign s closing days once with the pop singer katy perry on saturday night and then in a flashing neon sign of continuity with the president and michelle obama on monday evening for one final pre election rally 8 photos view
