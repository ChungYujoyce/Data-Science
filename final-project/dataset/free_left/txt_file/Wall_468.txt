advertisement supported by the president announced the nomination of an inspector general for the department of health and human services who if confirmed would replace an acting official whose report embarrassed mr trump by peter baker washington president trump moved on friday night to replace a top official at the department of health and human services who angered him with a report last month highlighting supply shortages and testing delays at hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic the white house waited until after business hours to announce the nomination of a new inspector general for the department who if confirmed would take over for christi a grimm the principal deputy inspector general who was publicly assailed by the president at a news briefing three weeks ago the nomination was the latest effort by mr trump against watchdog offices around his administration that have defied him in recent weeks he fired an inspector general involved in the inquiry that led to the president s impeachment nominated a white house aide to another key inspector general post overseeing virus relief spending and moved to block still another inspector general from taking over as chairman of a pandemic spending oversight panel mr trump has sought to assert more authority over his administration and clear out officials deemed insufficiently loyal in the three months since his senate impeachment trial on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress ended in acquittal largely along party lines while inspectors general are appointed by the president they are meant to be semiautonomous watchdogs ferreting out waste fraud and corruption in executive agencies the purge has continued unabated even during the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed about 65 000 lives in the united states ms grimm s case in effect merged the conflict over mr trump s response to the outbreak with his determination to sweep out those he perceives to be speaking out against him her report released last month and based on extensive interviews with hospitals around the country identified critical shortages of supplies revealing that hundreds of medical centers were struggling to obtain test kits protective gear for staff members and ventilators mr trump was embarrassed by the report at a time he was already under fire for playing down the threat of the virus and not acting quickly enough to ramp up testing and provide equipment to doctors and nurses it s just wrong the president said when asked about the report on april 6 did i hear the word inspector general really it s wrong and they ll talk to you about it it s wrong he then sought to find out who wrote the report where did he come from the inspector general what s his name no what s his name what s his name when the reporter did not know mr trump insisted well find me his name the president said let me know he expressed no interest in the report s findings except to categorically reject them sight unseen after learning that ms grimm had worked during president barack obama s administration mr trump asserted that the report was politically biased in fact ms grimm is not a political appointee but a career official who began working in the inspector general office late in president bill clinton s administration and served under president george w bush as well as mr obama she took over the office in an acting capacity when the previous inspector general stepped down mr trump was undaunted and attacked her on twitter why didn t the i g who spent 8 years with the obama administration did she report on the failed h1n1 swine flu debacle where 17 000 people died want to talk to the admirals generals v p others in charge before doing her report he wrote mischaracterizing the government s generally praised response to the 2009 epidemic that actually killed about 12 000 in the united states another fake dossier to take over as inspector general mr trump on friday night named jason c weida an assistant united states attorney in boston the white house said in its announcement that he had overseen numerous complex investigations in health care and other sectors he must be confirmed

of challenges including our groundbreaking work fighting the opioid epidemic and health care fraud as well as oversight of the planning response and funding for covid 19 the statement said we will continue to serve the american people by ensuring that their health and welfare are protected among several other nominations announced on friday was the president s choice for a new ambassador to ukraine filling a position last occupied by marie l yovanovitch ms yovanovitch was ousted a year ago because she was seen as an obstacle by the president s advisers as they tried to pressure the government in kyiv to incriminate mr trump s democratic rivals that effort to solicit political benefit from ukraine while withholding security aid led to mr trump s impeachment largely along party lines in december mr trump selected lt gen keith w dayton a retired 40 year army officer now serving as the director of the george c marshall european center for security studies in germany mr dayton
