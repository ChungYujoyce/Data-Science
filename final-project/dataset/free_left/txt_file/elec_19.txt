advertisement supported by op ed contributor by larry m bartels political scientists teach their students that to win elections the parties in a competitive two party system must take policy positions that appeal to centrist swing voters if voters choose the candidate closest to them ideologically moderates will hold the crucial balance of power necessary to win a majority but contemporary american political parties seem not to have gotten the message on major issues their positions routinely diverge from the center of public opinion with democrats well to the left for example see hillary clinton on abortion affirmative action and government spending and republicans well to the right for example see donald j trump on immigration foreign policy and tax cuts for the wealthy many analysts argue that candidates usually meaning their political opponents take extreme positions because they must cater to the views of the core partisans who provide them with primary votes enthusiasm and money modern republican politicians can t be serious liberals like paul krugman say because the party s base demands extremist positions conservatives like jason greenblatt claim that democratic candidates compete to see who can genuflect lower before the radical anti capitalist anti israel fringe of the democratic party yet the striking fact is that presidential candidates are frequently even more extreme than their own party s core supporters who have also become more extreme in recent decades using survey data from the authoritative american national election studies i have tracked the positions of swing voters those who are most likely to be pivotal in a close election and core partisans the most committed and politically active members of each party s base on five important issues since 1980 government spending jobs aid to african americans the survey asks if the federal government should make every effort to improve the social and economic positions of blacks military spending and overall liberal conservative ideology i compared these positions with the positions of the parties presidential candidates as assessed by politically well informed citizens in each election year who were asked to place the candidates on the same issue scales they used to place themselves across all five issues the average distance between democratic and republican core partisans increased by almost one third between 1980 and 2012 from 26 points to 34 points on a 100 point scale on average the democratic base moved 1 5 points further to the left of swing voters while the republican base moved 6 5 points further to the right while candidates positions do not seem very responsive to shifts in the positions of swing voters they are sometimes not all that responsive to shifts in the positions of their core supporters either blaming the parties bases for political polarization misses most of the story a more compelling explanation is that candidates take extreme stands because they can the electoral incentive to moderate their positions is too weak to outweigh their own ideological convictions the problem with the theory predicting that candidates will be compelled to adopt centrist positions to get elected is that it assumes centrist voters will reliably choose the candidate whose policy positions are closest to their own but centrist voters mostly have other things on their minds from economic anxieties to foreign crises cultural animosities and candidates personalities the authors of a recent analysis of ideological extremism in presidential elections over the past several decades including the landslide defeats of barry goldwater and george mcgovern concluded that the electoral cost of extremism was negligible compared with the effects of other economic and political factors goldwater in 1964 and mcgovern in 1972 probably did a few percentage points worse than they would have if they had been more moderate but they lost mainly because they were challenging incumbents who presided over election year economic booms in contrast ronald reagan in 1980 and barack obama in 2008 had the good fortune to run in years when economic recessions undermined the political appeal of their more moderate opponents and they both won easily in this year s race mrs clinton is leading in the polls despite her hard core liberal campaign stands and a voting record to the left of most senate democrats mr trump is trailing despite having moderated some of his party s conservative stands on issues like social spending and gay rights on the whole his policy positions are probably closer to the center of the electorate than those of previous republican presidential candidates have been yet many voters who ought to find those positions appealing have been alienated by mr trump s bombast and political inexperience it would be hard to argue that a candidate s temperament and experience should be irrelevant to voters but it is also worth asking whether policy extremism is such a bad thing anyway people who are quick to condemn the extremism of their political opponents often see virtue in their own party s deviations from centrist opinion the single largest difference in positions between either party s presidential candidates and swing voters over the past three decades has been on the issue of racial policy on average republican candidates have been seen as just six points to the right of the political center on the question of government assistance to african americans democratic candidates have been 26 points to the left this gulf between democratic candidates and swing voters may reflect principled adherence to a progressive vision of racial justice or pragmatic catering to the interests of a key group in the democratic electoral coalition or most likely some combination of both the gulf widened in the last two election cycles but not because barack obama was seen as more liberal than his predecessors on this issue rather the political center had itself shifted even further to the right than it had been in the 1980s and 90s democrats may be tempted to say that that is a political center they want no part of perhaps they would add with or without some awareness of irony that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue but that is just the sort of thinking repeated on issue after issue on both sides of the political spectrum that accounts for why our politics often seem so polarized advertisement
