pointed to early indications that the crisis could be plateauing though he cautioned against jumping to any conclusions the number of deaths in the state has reached 4 159 mr cuomo said but notably there were slightly fewer fatalities on saturday than on friday you could argue that you re seeing a slight plateauing in the data which obviously would be good news mr cuomo said at his daily briefing in albany but he noted that it was too soon to say whether the changes in the numbers were indicative of a trend mr cuomo also said he would seek to shift patients from overloaded hospitals to other facilities with lighter workloads supplies like gowns and masks were being shifted among hospitals as well he said i can t say to a hospital i will send you all the supplies you need i will send you all the ventilators you need he said we don t have them it s not an exercise it s not a drill it s just a statement of reality you re going to have to shift and deploy resources to different locations based on the need of that location responding to concerns about whether parts of upstate new york would be left vulnerable if ventilators were moved downstate mr cuomo said no single area of the state could handle the crisis by itself i don t see any other operational model he said you cannot handle this without your brothers and sisters here are the latest statistics from mr cuomo s

de blasio also said that 291 military medical personnel were arriving to work in the city s public hospitals but that the city still needed more aid that s a very good start the mayor said but i want

back to the president to f e m a to the department of defense and let them know we need a lot more help for our public hospitals responding to questions about sighting of him walking with his wife without a face mask in prospect park the mayor said that he had been wearing a scarf as a face covering and adhering to the guidance given last week to all new yorkers if you are distant from everyone there s no one near you there is not a specific need he said if you think you re going to be near people you bring it up and cover your face that is what i did he added you don t have to wear it every minute weeks after the coronavirus was first detected in rikers island the first inmate at the jail complex died on sunday from complications related to the virus according to two people with knowledge of the matter the inmate a 53 year old had been on rikers island since feb 28 until he was transported to a hospital on march 26 according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution the department of correction did not immediately respond to a request for comment the death of the inmate came as the number of detainees and correction staff with the virus continued to climb on sunday the department said 273 inmates 321 correction staff and 53 health workers had tested positive for coronavirus four correction staff members have died from the virus public officials have moved to release hundreds of inmates in recent weeks in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus behind bars public defenders and jail health officials have called for more releases the virus has also begun to wreak havoc in prisons throughout new york state killing a total of two other inmates a civilian employee and a parolee according to the department of correction and community supervision a tiger at the bronx zoo has been confirmed to be infected with covid 19 in what is believed to be a case of what one official called human to cat transmission this is the first instance of a tiger being infected with covid 19 according to the u s department of agriculture which noted that although only one tiger was tested the virus appeared to have infected other animals as well several lions and tigers at the zoo showed symptoms of respiratory illness according to a statement by the agriculture department public health officials believe that the large cats caught the virus from a zoo employee the tiger appeared visibly sick by march 27 in a statement the agriculture department suggested that those infected with the virus should out of an abundance of caution avoid contact with their pets and other animals the centers for disease control and prevention has said that it is aware of a very small number of pets outside the united states reported to be infected the c d c has said that it does not have evidence that pets can spread the coronavirus the sick tigers include nadia a 4 year old female malayan tiger and her sister azul as well as two amur tigers they live in the zoo s tiger mountain exhibit while the zookeepers generally keep a barrier between them and the cats they do get within a few feet of the animals during the course of feeding and doing enrichment they will come within feet of them but on opposite sides of the barrier said dr paul calle chief veterinarian at the bronx zoo a truck bearing the new england patriots logo delivered hundreds of thousands of much needed masks to a makeshift hospital in new york city s midtown manhattan on friday the 300 000 n95 masks arrived at the jacob k javits convention center at a crucial moment as the city experienced perhaps its worst day in the crisis reporting 305 new deaths on friday alone health workers across the city and state have complained of a shortage of crucial supplies they need to stay safe and treat patients with some organizing protests at their hospitals in normal times the new england patriots are new york s rivals but today they acted as friends delivering 300 000 much needed masks to our front line health care workers gov andrew m cuomo said in a release updated may 12 2020 there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others this is a difficult question because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained a better question might be how will we know when to reopen the country in an american enterprise institute report scott gottlieb caitlin rivers mark b mcclellan lauren silvis and crystal watson staked out four goal posts for recovery hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested it seems to spread very easily from person to person especially in homes hospitals and other confined spaces the pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out it may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face no clinical trials are underway in the united states china and europe but american officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away unlike the flu there is no known treatment or vaccine and little is known about this particular virus so far it seems to be more lethal than the flu but the numbers are still uncertain and it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions not just those with respiratory diseases particularly hard if the family member doesn t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms while also keeping as much distance as possible according to guidelines issued by the c d c if there s space the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if masks are available both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters doorknobs toilets and tables don t forget to wash your hands frequently plan two weeks of meals if possible but people should not hoard food or supplies despite the empty shelves the supply chain remains strong and remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea that s not a good idea even if you re retired having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation or even grows makes sense but retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years watching your balance go up and down can be scary you may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions don t if your employer matches any part of your contributions make sure you re at least saving as much as you can to get that free money the team had received a shipment of over 1 million face masks from china earlier in the week after the massachusetts governor and the team s owner teamed up to buy the supplies the rest will go to hospitals in massachusetts all along the empty streets of manhattan the messages reach out from the newly darkened storefronts the notes express empathy resolve concern even humor a reflection of new york s spirit after gov andrew m cuomo ordered all nonessential businesses in new york to close last month many storefronts had messages for their customers we looked at some of those voices in waiting around the city dr peter lee an emergency room doctor from montville n j was fighting the coronavirus on multiple fronts at work he was dodging exposure at home he worried about infecting his pregnant wife and young daughters and everyday he was navigating a new bias against chinese americans and on march 20 he posted on wechat the social media app popular with many chinese americans he asked for donations of personal protective equipment for himself and his colleagues the result members of the millburn short hills chinese association raised more than 50 000 and obtained 10 000 masks gowns and other equipment from a chinese company with a warehouse in queens that was just one example of small groups from the chinese american community uniting to fight the pandemic in this country even as they face racist remarks and physical attacks comments like calling this the chinese virus have ramifications for someone like me said dr lee 34 they fuel a certain prejudice against my kind using mostly wechat chinese americans are creating vast networks and rallying contacts here and in china to procure supplies for doctors and nurses in need the long island chinese american association was delivering more than 10 000 masks to three hospitals and nearly 8 000 surgical masks to the visiting nursing service of new york the coalition of asian americans in private practice a new york group has raised close to 250 000 since january and expects to get 80 000 n95 masks to hospitals this month a group of chinese american professors at rutgers university raised 12 000 and collected more than 4 000 masks to support a hospital in new brunswick n j mohammed saiful islam got a taste of how antiquated the technology that runs new york state s unemployment insurance system is when he had to go to a staples store in the middle of a pandemic to fax his pay stubs to albany mr islam a lyft driver who lives in queens and has been idled by the outbreak is among more than 450 000 new yorkers who have tried often in vain to apply for unemployment benefits in the past three weeks as he and many others discovered the state s archaic systems were woefully unprepared for the deluge of claims in mr islam s case he said it took him four days to reach someone who could explain what he had to do to complete the application process state officials admitted as recently as last summer that there were problems with the technology used for such applications describing new york s unemployment insurance systems as relics from the heyday of mainframe computers the software programs that run the systems were written in the 1970s and 1980s and remain constrained by the technology of that era officials wrote while seeking bids as part of a planned modernization project in march when hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs had suddenly evaporated started trying to log onto the labor department website or call its phone lines the systems failed would be applicants frustration grew as their computer screens froze repeatedly and their calls went unanswered for days some attempts to apply for benefits yielded a pop up message that suggested using netscape a browser that effectively no longer exists mr islam who had never applied for jobless benefits in the 35 years since he immigrated from bangladesh said he was taken aback to hear that he had to find a fax machine to complete his claim but he put on a face mask and gloves and warily trudged off to a staples store late this week he was still waiting to hear how much he would receive and when more than 800 000
