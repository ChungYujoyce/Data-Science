 2016 sinking in the polls and struggling to gain traction in new hampshire the new jersey governor could be relegated to the kiddie table debate next month by daniel strauss 08 22 2015 08 01 am edt updated 08 24 2015 05 46 pm edt he was supposed to be the brash blunt new york area candidate who told it like it is then came donald trump chris christie the voluble new jersey governor is once again facing the possibility that he might be relegated to the junior varsity debate and rival republican campaigns and outside observers say his window to re enter the top tier of presidential candidates is closing fast advertisement wednesday night s scene in new hampshire showed the daunting challenge ahead of christie as cnn fox news and msnbc covered trump s first town hall live breaking only to run clips of jeb bush attacking the real estate tycoon christie was gasping for air on c span because the governor s dimly lit event a town hall at a restaurant outside of manchester was outdoors the few viewers watching saw the candidate gradually disappear into darkness the next day s headlines duly focused on the jeb donald contretemps ignoring christie s play for a state he has made central to his fading white house hopes he s just not getting the traction that i think he was expecting said andy seale the former chairman of the republican party in hillsborough county new hampshire also on politico katie glueck christie has become such an also ran that the associated press and the new york times recently reassigned reporters dedicated to covering christie jill colvin and kate zernike to other beats then there are the polls if current trends hold the new jersey governor will likely lose his spot in the prime time cnn reagan library debate on sept 16 displaced by a surging carly fiorina as of midday thursday christie was in 11th place among gop presidential contenders in the realclearpolitics average of national polls behind trump bush ben carson gov scott walker sen marco rubio sen ted cruz fiorina sen rand paul gov john kasich and former arkansas gov mike huckabee on tuesday a new cnn orc poll found christie in 11th place with only 3 percent support among registered gop voters a separate politico analysis of the five most recent national polls that would factor into who would appear for the main debate finds christie tied with kasich for 10th place for now and with trump owning the straight talk vote said former new jersey gov thomas kean there s little christie can do to claw his way back we re all living in trump world said kean and trump world is something none of these political gurus or any of these guys conceived of when they started running their campaigns he ticked off a list of what christie has done right town hall meetings check he did well at the debate check he s taking positions which seem to be along the line of what mainline republicans want in new hampshire check it s all kean said exactly what christie should be doing yet there s no sign that any of it is getting traction if you re doing everything that your campaign consultants and staff say you should be doing and nothing s working that s a real problem kean said and nothing s working trump s dominance of the news cycle is a major factor holding christie down others said how republicans wonder can christie hope to be the one dropping truth bombs when trump is strafing voters 24 7 it s hard to be the candidate making his mark for frankness when your competition is trump said katie packer gage a former top aide to mitt romney so he needs to find a new shtick or hope trump trips up soon but it s not just trump operatives in rival campaigns also point to the threat to christie from kasich another brash plain spoken governor with a focus on new hampshire kasich has surged to third place in the state according to last week s franklin pierce university boston herald poll behind trump and bush also on politico eliza collins meanwhile christie has just stalled said jamie burnett a jeb bush supporter and republican political strategist who served as romney s political director in new hampshire i think part of the reason is that there is a lot of competition there are a lot of people occupying that space whether it s bush or rubio or fiorina or walker or kasich that all more or less appeal to a similar voter segment burnett said christie s fall is a contrast from the shadow campaign phase of the 2016 presidential race when his name was often bandied about as a top tier contender people thought oh he is going to be a front runner said charlie arlinghaus the former new hampshire regional director for the republican national committee we didn t know if jeb bush was going to get in or not nobody predicted donald trump or any of these things arlinghaus who isn t currently behind any republican candidate said that all isn t necessarily lost for christie is he in a great spot no he s not arlinghaus said it s not clear at this point whether he s going to be a finalist or not on the other hand he s campaigning hard here and people your goal here is to get on peoples dance card so that they want to think about you a little bit right now that s where people are and i think that a lot of people who are looking at kasich or bush or trump for different reasons might also end up taking a look at christie even critics of christie point to the strong team he s assembled in new hampshire matt mowers the director of the christie campaign in the granite state is regularly praised by other campaigns as a seasoned and adept operative the christie campaign on thursday rolled out seven prominent republicans in the new hampshire statehouse who endorsed the governor the campaign also points to the 59 public events and 17 town halls christie has done so far in the state tucker martin an adviser for the pro christie america leads super pac also pointed to an aggressive focus on new hampshire the super pac has put 1 1 million in a tv digital buy in new hampshire and 2 8 million on a pre buy on new hampshire s wmur for nov 16 through feb 9 the super pac is also conducting a mobile advertising campaign targeted at attendees at campaign events the super pac is also conducting online surveys of potential voters for christie the data from those surveys will be used to boost turnout for christie in an email mike duhaime christie s top strategist said he feels good about the progress we continue to make in nh since announcing the governor s favorable ratio continues to rise in new hampshire a leading indicator of support duhaime said in the average public polls that measure image ratings the governor s favorable rating has improved by 10 points in new hampshire over the three months prior to his announcement christie campaign communications director samantha smith said the campaign was confident that christie would be in the main debate in september also on politico marc caputo and anna palmer he ll continue to have a really aggressive political and fundraising schedule over the next month just like he has over the last month as a declared candidate and he ll continue to do that in new hampshire iowa and south carolina smith said she also pushed back on arguments that christie was being pushed out by kasich and fiorina i think there is room for everyone very early in the process smith said we re at the end of august with so many candidates with a long way to go i don t think that they re taking up all the space but even if christie does qualify for another prime time debate another republican operative whose firm is working for a candidate polling near the front of the primary field was skeptical that he could gain much traction to me it just delays the inevitable i don t know how he leapfrogs the top four or five people right now i can see how he stays in for a couple months but i don t know how he really jostles and all of a sudden is taking jeb voters away or kasich voters the operative said missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020 politico llc
