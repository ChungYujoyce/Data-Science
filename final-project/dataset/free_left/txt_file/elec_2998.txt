popular vote on tuesday by a wide margin with national polls showing sustained disapproval of president trump and yet the fate of the chamber is not a foregone conclusion on the day before the midterm elections two vastly different outcomes remain easy to imagine there could be a democratic blowout that decisively ends republicans control of the house and even endangers their senate majority or there could be a district by district battle for house control that lasts late on election night and perhaps for weeks after the first would be interpreted as a repudiation of donald j trump the second as another example of his political resilience but the difference turns on just a few percentage points across dozens of house districts that remain exceptionally close according to new york times upshot siena college surveys conducted over the last few weeks after more than 10 000 interviews the result in the aggregate is that democrats and republicans are essentially tied in the 30 districts rated as tossups by the cook political report with democrats leading by around half a percentage point democrats need to win only a handful of these tossup districts perhaps as few as six to gain the net 23 seats needed to take control which is why they re considered favorites but democrats haven t put them away instead those races remain startlingly close each of the final 28 poll results in the tossup districts was within the margin of error and 20 of the 28 were within two percentage points a margin that pales in comparison with the typical measurement error in a poll with so many close contests even modest late shifts among undecided voters or a slightly unexpected turnout could yield significantly different results with very different consequences for the government and the future of the trump presidency over all the polls comport with the growing consensus among operatives from both parties that democrats are poised to gain around 35 seats in the house if the times siena polls were exactly right they will not be democrats would gain 32 seats assuming the two parties held the seats that were not polled all of the conditions remain in place for a so called wave election like those that last flipped control of the house in 1994 2006 and 2010 democrats hold a commanding lead on the generic congressional ballot which asks voters whether they intend to vote for democrats or republicans for congress including an eight point lead in an abc washington post poll in sunday but the republicans have considerable structural advantages in the house that the president s party didn t have to the same extent in previous wave elections they are generally defending districts that voted for the president a result of partisan gerrymandering and the tendency for democrats to post lopsided and inefficient victories in urban areas the republican geographic advantage is even more significant in the senate where republicans are all but assured to retain control if they win just three of seven competitive seats where mr trump won by at least nine points in 2016 the democrats are poised to defy those structural disadvantages in the house because they ve put so many republican leaning districts into play with a deep and exceptionally well funded class of candidates but republicans can hope that partisan polarization is just enough to keep even strong democrats from going over the top the president has emphasized immigration and other hot button issues down the final stretch perhaps in an intentional effort to divide the electorate along the lines of the 2016 election if republicans succeed in polarizing the electorate they could take advantage of their underlying geographic advantages and hold down their losses in the house and gain seats in the senate transcript the new york times needle some people love it and some people hate it it s been the inspiration behind many pithy tweets and election coverage hot takes now the needle is back for a sixth time nate cohn is one of its creators he s an expert numbers cruncher who covers polling and demographics at the times the needle is an election night forecast so it looks at the votes that have been counted and it looks at what votes are left and estimates what the final result will be people spent weeks trying to think of what the right way was to communicate our forecasts in a way that was compelling to people obviously it s resonated in some interesting and you know i don t know but yeah i d say unexpected ways people have a really emotional response to the needle because of what happened in 2016 namely the needle pointing from clinton over to trump as the night wore on it s worth noting by the way that when i talk about people i m mainly talking about liberals i think that republicans have a very different memory of the needle on election night some of what i think elicited the emotional response that the needle quivered or jittered maybe more precisely the intention behind that was to show the uncertainty that surely played out on election night in 2016 and we were trying to come up with ways to communicate that in a way that was a little bit more visceral than just a probability so how does it work the data is gathered from mainly from the associated press and every county in the country except in alaska which all sort of reports as one state tells you the number of precincts that have been counted it says what the tabulated vote is to that point including by candidate we match that data to our pre election expectations for every county in the country that s going to vote that s informed based on the results that we ve seen so far early in the night it s also based on our projection for what we expected for the county and it s also based on what the results in other counties have taught us about whether democrats or republicans might be expected to fare better or worse than we initially thought i think that there is something about like the clarity of the way the needle moves and points it has a decisive feel to it the visual gives it much more strength than the number alone does i think in a lot of cases alone a more polarized electorate wouldn t be enough for republicans to hold the house there are too many districts that voted for hillary clinton to retain house control republicans would probably need some good luck on top of a more polarized map or perhaps a broader 2016 like polling error but a narrow democratic majority might take weeks to become clear as california and washington count late mail ballots the emphasis on a wide range of possible outcomes isn t just a matter of hedging by pollsters and analysts after the shock of 2016 when mr trump beat long odds the uncertainty reflects the sparse data available and the unusually large number of competitive contests in dozens of key districts no more than a few polls have been done making it hard to be confident whether and where democratic or republican candidates might hold a lead final house polls have historically been less accurate than polls of statewide contests and presidential races on average house polls differ from final election results by around eight percentage points these polls tend to have relatively small sample sizes increasing the margin of error and voters tend to be less familiar with house candidates meaning more undecideds until late in the race democrats hope that these common sources of polling error might break their way this time turnout is always uncertain but it is more variable in lower turnout elections like a midterm when even modest shifts in enthusiasm can transform the electorate it is a particularly challenging question this year in part because the turnout in recent midterm elections has been so low and so republican this year s early vote tallies already make it clear that the turnout will greatly exceed that of four years ago but it is far less clear how that will translate to actual votes it is equally unclear whether pollsters have been assuming the high turnout more democratic electorate implied by early voting and the turnout in the special and general elections since mr trump became president over the last few weeks the share of voters indicating that they re almost certain to vote has increased by 10 points in times siena polls from 66 percent to 76 percent of the likely electorate in a few cases the turnout in early voting has shown some polls were off in their projection of who will vote early voting in several texas counties has already surpassed the projected electorate of a times siena poll from early october and the democratic senate candidate beto o rourke seems likely to benefit from the higher turnout a monmouth poll of california s 48th district in coastal orange county showed the republican incumbent dana rohrabacher leading by two points with an electorate in which registered republicans outnumbered democrats by 18 points the actual republican advantage in early voting is down to 12 points and continues to drop as turnout increases the final times siena poll of california s 48th shows the democrat harley rouda leading mr rohrabacher narrowly with an electorate where registered republicans outnumber democrats by 10 points an indicator of the extent that republicans are struggling in the wealthy suburban bastions of 20th century conservatism democrats can also hope that undecided voters will break their way it is often supposed that voters will break against incumbents and republicans will be in trouble if there s merit to that assumption no republican incumbent has eclipsed 50 percent in any of our polls of the tossup districts undecided voters are also often thought to break toward the party out of power and perhaps that s especially likely with stupendously well funded democrats spending millions to increase their name recognition in the final stretch it s paying off for democrats in the times siena polls on average democratic challengers are now known by 82 percent of voters in polls over the last 10 days up from 60 percent in september astonishingly it s enough for the democrats to effectively deny the republicans the advantage of incumbency that usually helps a party hold the house in the battleground polls finished over the last 10 days a larger share of the electorate now has a favorable view of the democratic challengers than the republican incumbents with 48 percent of likely voters holding a favorable view of the democratic candidate compared with just 46 percent who have a favorable view of the republican incumbent all of this may be adding up to a late shift toward democrats the times reported that both democratic and republican operatives see house polls as trending democratic in the final days and the last wave of times siena polls are at least consistent with that possibility across the final times siena polls finished over the weekend democrats improved their position by an average of three percentage points over the prior poll of the same district and democrats have shown surprising late strength in times siena polls of districts that weren t previously thought to be top tier contests like pennsylvania s 10th florida s 15th georgia s sixth and illinois s 14th at the same time republicans have rushed to defend a tier of contests that seem even likelier to remain on their side like south carolina s first georgia s seventh and michigan s sixth if well funded democrats are breaking through in this next tier of races democrats could easily win more than 45 seats but late movement doesn t necessarily predict the final result just ask mrs clinton who gained slightly in the final polls taken in the weekend ahead of the 2016 election
