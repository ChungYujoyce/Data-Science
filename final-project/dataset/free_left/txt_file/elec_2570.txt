advertisement supported by opinion by jonathan rauch although this year s presidential race has not been a season of gentle ironies there s one to be found in the revelation of what are alleged to be hillary clinton s closed door speeches after all the fuss about the bombshells they might contain they show a warmer and more relaxed figure than the guarded elusive and sometimes evasive persona she presents to the public just as refreshing they show a disarming candor including candor about lack of candor politicians need to be two faced mrs clinton supposedly said the campaign has not confirmed the leaked documents authenticity if her frank critique of frankness proves to be more of a political nonevent than a bombshell as has been the case to date that will be for a good reason most of us know she is right even if we don t admit it when charged by stephen douglas with being two faced abraham lincoln replied not with a denial but with a quip if i had another face do you think i would wear this one citing his example mrs clinton is reported to have said this in a 2013 speech to the national multifamily housing council you just have to sort of figure out how to getting back to that word balance how to balance the public and the private efforts that are necessary to be successful politically and that s not just a comment about today she said she added politics is like sausage being made it is unsavory and it always has been that way but we usually end up where we need to be but if everybody s watching all of the back room discussions and the deals then people get a little nervous to say the least so you need both a public and a private position right in politics hypocrisy and doublespeak are tools they can be used nefariously illegally or for personal gain as when president richard m nixon denied watergate complicity but they can also be used for legitimate public purposes such as trying to prevent a civil war as in lincoln s case or trying to protect american prestige and security as when president dwight d eisenhower denied that the soviet union had shot down a united states spy plane during his 2008 campaign barack obama promised to televise negotiations over health care reform but when the real work had to be done the negotiators shut the doors in a study of defense bills in congress the political scientist colleen j shogan quotes a former senate armed services committee staff director as saying why should we do it in the open it would wreck the seriousness of the purpose staff needs to give candid views to senators and you can t do that in open session governing in the sunshine shouldn t be applied to everything is it hypocritical to take one line in private then adjust or deny it in public of course but maintaining separate public and private faces is something we all do every day we tell annoying relatives we enjoyed their visits thank inept waiters for rotten service and agree with bosses who we know are wrong the japanese whose political culture is less idealistic than our own have a vocabulary for socially constructive lying honne from true sound is what we really believe tatemae from facade is what we aver in public using honne when tatemae is called for is considered not bravely honest but rude and antisocial and rightly so unnecessary and excessive directness hurts feelings foments conflict and complicates coexistence modern social science makes a related distinction between shared knowledge and public knowledge public knowledge is information that is out there in plain and undeniable view stuff like stock prices weather bulletins and campaign promises if knowledge is public you and i both know it and you know that i know it and i know that you know it and you know that i know that you know it ad infinitum if knowledge is merely shared knowledge by contrast you and i both know it but i m not sure if you know and you re not sure if i know shared knowledge has a very handy if somewhat peculiar trait even if we both know it we can plausibly deny knowing it maybe you and i both know we dated the same person at the same time but if neither of us is sure the other knows we can both pretend not to know thereby staying friends keeping knowledge out of the public domain can finesse all kinds of social conflicts and embarrassments in laws can pretend not to despise one another everyday life would be intolerable without public denials and mutual winks they are equally important in politics behind closed doors negotiators can float trial balloons and make tacit offers deniably they can say things like this isn t an offer mind you but just hypothetically what if i were to suggest we could accept a medicare cut if you could accept a capital gains tax increase if you show hypothetical interest in my hypothetical offer i can go and try it out on my caucus and constituents if you wave me off well no offer was ever made so i m not embarrassed often the only way to get something done is to have separate private and public truths behind closed doors nothing is settled until everything is settled until the deal is done everyone can pretend not to have decided anything but the moment the conversation becomes public plausible deniability ceases everyone knows i ve made an offer angry interest groups adversaries in the other party and even purists in my own party start cutting attack ads and lining up challengers to prevent a deal and defeat me in diplomacy having two faces is similarly indispensable until recently the existence of the united states use of drones for targeted killing was classified not because it was a secret everyone knew about it especially the targets but because public acknowledgment would embarrass key allies as long as we pretended not to tell they pretended not to know mrs clinton s instinct is to overprotect her privacy and over manage her image this makes her less relatable as a candidate breeds suspicion and caused her a world of grief over her email fair enough to criticize her on those counts yet give credit where credit is due an experienced political negotiator and former chief diplomat she understands that hypocrisy and two facedness when prudently harnessed to advance negotiations or avert conflicts are a public good and a political necessity of course she can t say so at least not in public in our hearts we know she s right but shush it s a secret advertisement
