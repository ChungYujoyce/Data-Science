donald trump doesn t just defeat his establishment republican opponents he leaves them humiliated so it was for marco rubio who lost his own state florida to donald trump on tuesday night in the republican primary as rubio didn t even bother running again for senate reports say that he hates being a senator this could be the end of his time in public office at least for now the defeat was absolute florida is a winner takes all state for the republicans but it hardly mattered as rubio could barely eke out a little more than 1 in 4 republican votes unburdened by the need to win elections any election rubio issued a concession speech that was an unsubtle rebuke to trump america s in the middle of a real political storm a real tsunami he said concluding sadly and we should have seen this coming after arguing that american needs a vibrant conservative movement rubio railed but one that s built on principles and on ideas not on fear not on anger not on preying on people s frustrations rubio is an empty shell a robot who mostly runs on programs that his funders and campaign staff input in him but for a small sad moment you saw a bit of the human being lurking under that glib armor we glimpsed rubio s soul asoul really really hates trump one mildly hopes before he shuffles off into obscurity rubio has it in him to preserve his dignity by refusing to support trump in the general it would be a small victory but better than whatever hell chris christie is living through now for most of trump s celebratory speech in florida it seemed the candidate was going to ignore the controversies of the week focusing on important soundingissues like trade that have nothing to do with why his supporters actually love him but just as a hundredpundits started to type out pivoting to the general the real trumpcame sneaking out then paris happened he started crediting terrorist attacks in france and san bernardino california for the surge in the polls that made him a contender we need protection in our country and that s going to happen he continued and then the poll numbers just shot up celebrating mass murder because it boosted your polls might seem an unusual move but at this point no one can deny that trump communes very well with what the most repulsive members of the conservative coalition want to hear it s not quite pushing him into half the republican electorate a fact that he spent much of his speech obsessing over but those who live in irrational fear of terrorism sure do love him that trump would win the night was largely expected which is scary enough but even scarier was the possibilitythat the events in chicago where trump seemingly manipulated events to create a near riot would give his campaign a boost trump and his surrogates have been hustling hard in recent days using the event to argue that they are victims of thugs who censor people because of political correctness the narrative seemed like it might be working one poll showed that florida republicans were more likely to support trump afterthe violence in chicago but in the end it doesn t seem like it mattered much realclearpolitics had trump polling at 43 going into the florida primary and he walked away with 46 if the stunt swayed any votes in ohio which is one of the midwestern states where racial tensions have been high in recent months there s no real evidence of it john kasich the governor of ohio was expected to win with around 40 of the vote and the polling data shows that if anything he did slightly better than expected of course that s the only state kasich is expected to win but in a display of almost mind bending delusion he gave a speech complete with a huge confetti explosion where he acted like he had the nomination wrapped up we re going all the way to cleveland and secure the republican nomination he yelled to great applause from an equally deluded audience considering thattrump has literally 9 times as many delegates as he does this kind of confidence seems misplaced kasich is pinning all his hopes on a contested convention which is only a possibility because trump can t quite seem to get the majority he needs to win the nomination outright with rubio out kasich is the last establishment candidate in the race and that designation seems to be the only real evidence he has for this idea that he ll show up at the convention and be able to win over all these delegates in a way that he was not able to win over any voters outside of the state of ohio kasich ended his speech promising to beat hillary clinton it was an odd note suggesting as it does that he believes clinton s delegate lead will lead to the nomination not the message you want out if you re trying to push the idea that your opponent s massive delegate lead is a minor obstacle between a candidate and getting the nomination and then there is ted cruz who still thinks he has a chance making a nauseating speech where he reiterated his claim that he s the only reasonable challenge to trump trump swept most of the states even missouri which was supposed to be the win that reinvigorated the cruz campaign was such a squeaker that hours after the polls closed the networks were still afraid to declare a winner despite all this cruz continues to hope thata showdown between the amoral capitalist narcissist vs the slimy and insincere fundamentalist will get him the publicity he needs to start rising in the polls nice idea but we ve seen that movie before it s called there will be blood and if cruzwere the sort to watch movies instead of stare creepily into corners during his down time he would also know how it ends cruz spent nine months proclaiming that he s the jesus guy for people who are supposedly too christianto vote for a thrice married sleaze like trump but it turns out that those people weren t so much moral as they were just really interested in using jesus as a cover for sexism and racism tuesday night as with most of the election trump is doing better with the bible thumpers than cruz who is supposedly one of their own so this is where we sit in the middle of march a orange colored frontrunner who is so unethical in his methods he makes republicans look good by comparison which is a real trick i ll tell you what and two sadly deluded men one who thinks god wants him to win and the other who thinks the republican wizard will step out from behind the curtain to fix it all but it increasingly looks like that savior is not coming out of the sky or any smoky backroom to deny trump the nomination the question now is how the republican party will cope with the realization that this is after all this time really happening amanda marcotte is a politics writer for salon who covers american politics
