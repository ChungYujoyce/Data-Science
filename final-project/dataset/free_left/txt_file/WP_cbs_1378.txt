watch cbsn live june 29 2019 12 26 pm cbs ap president trump issued a twitter invitation saturday to north korea s kim jong un to meet for a handshake at the demilitarized zone that separates the north and south and expressed a willingness to cross the border for what would be a history making photo opportunity while there if chairman kim of north korea sees this i would meet him at the border dmz just to shake his hand and say hello mr trump tweeted the invitation while long rumored in diplomatic circles still came across as an impulsive display of showmanship by a president bent on obtaining a legacy defining nuclear deal north korea responded by calling the offer a very interesting suggestion after some very important meetings including my meeting with president xi of china i will be leaving japan for south korea with president moon while there if chairman kim of north korea sees this i would meet him at the border dmz just to shake his hand and say hello presidential visits to the dmz are traditionally carefully guarded secrets for security reasons white house officials couldn t immediately say whether kim had agreed to meet with mr trump the president himself claimed before flying from japan to south korea that he wasn t even sure kim was in north korea to accept the invitation all i did is put out a feeler if you d like to meet mr trump said later of the message to kim he added somewhat implausibly i just thought of it this morning later after arriving in seoul from a summit in osaka of world leaders mr trump offered no further insight into his planned trip to the heavily fortified border it will be very interesting he said while in japan mr trump said at a news conference that he was literally visiting the dmz but wasn t sure whether kim would meet him mr trump said he d feel very comfortable crossing the border into north korea if kim showed up saying he d have no problem becoming the first u s president to step into north korea his comments followed hours after mr trump asked for kim to meet him there it was not immediately clear what the agenda if any would be for the potential third trump kim meeting if he s there we ll see each other for two minutes mr trump predicted such a spectacle would present a valuable propaganda victory for kim who with his family has long been denied the recognition they sought on the international stage despite mr trump s comments saturday he told the hill this past week that he would be visiting the dmz and might meet with kim the paper reported it had withheld mr trump s comments citing security concerns by the white house north korea s first vice foreign minister choe son hui said the meeting if realized would serve as another meaningful occasion in further deepening the personal relations between the two leaders and advancing the bilateral relations south korea s presidential blue house said in a tweet that mr trump asked south korean president moon jae in at the group of 20 meetings whether he d seen mr trump s twitter message to kim when moon replied he had mr trump said let s try doing it and raised his thumb the blue house said a moon aide told reporter after the presidents had dinner that they agreed a possible trump kim meeting would be a good thing moon talked about kim s commitment to denuclearization while mr trump expressed his amicable views on kim according to the official yoon do han who added that a meeting would help pave the way for the resumption of nuclear diplomacy mr trump s summit with kim in vietnam earlier this year collapsed without an agreement for denuclearizing the korean peninsula he became the first sitting u s president to meet with the leader of the isolated nation last year when they signed an agreement in singapore to bring the north toward denuclearization substantive talks between the nations have largely broken down since then the north has balked at mr trump s insistence that it give up its weapons before it sees relief from crushing international sanctions still mr trump has sought to praise kim who oversees an authoritarian government in hopes of keeping the prospects of a deal alive and the two have traded flowery letters in recent weeks every president since ronald reagan has visited the 1953 armistice line except for george h w bush who visited when he was vice president the show of bravado and support for south korea one of america s closest military allies has evolved over the years to include binoculars and bomber jackets mr trump ever the showman appears to be looking to one up his predecessors with a kim meeting as he left the white house for asia earlier this week mr trump was asked whether he d meet with kim i ll be meeting with a lot of other people but i may be speaking to him in a different form mr trump said such trips to the demilitarized zone are usually undertaken under heavy security and the utmost secrecy mr trump tried to visit the dmz when he was in seoul in november 2017 but his helicopter was grounded by heavy fog mr trump has staked his self professed deal making reputation on his rapprochement with the north and has even turned it into a campaign rallying cry mr trump has repeatedly alleged that if he had lost the 2016 presidential campaign the u s would be at war with north korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs the meeting would come at a time of escalating tensions while north korea has not recently tested a long range missile that could reach the u s last month it fired off a series of short range missiles mr trump has brushed off the significance of the tests even as his own national security adviser john bolton has said they violated u n security council resolutions first published on june 28
