two years before the novel coronavirus pandemic upended the world u s embassy officials visited a chinese research facility in the city of wuhan several times and sent two official warnings back to washington about inadequate safety at the lab which was conducting risky studies on coronaviruses from bats the cables have fueled discussions inside the u s government about whether this or another wuhan lab was the source of the virus even though conclusive proof has yet to emerge in january 2018 the u s embassy in beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending u s science diplomats to the wuhan institute of virology wiv which had in 2015 become china s first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety known as bsl 4 wiv issued a news release in english about the last of these visits which occurred on march 27 2018 the u s delegation was led by jamison fouss the consul general in wuhan and rick switzer the embassy s counselor of environment science technology and health last week wiv erased that statement from its website though it remains archived on the internet full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic what the u s officials learned during their visits concerned them so much that they dispatched two diplomatic cables categorized as sensitive but unclassified back to washington the cables warned about safety and management weaknesses at the wiv lab and proposed more attention and help the first cable which i obtained also warns that the lab s work on bat coronaviruses and their potential human transmission represented a risk of a new sars like pandemic during interactions with scientists at the wiv laboratory they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high containment laboratory states the jan 19 2018 cable which was drafted by two officials from the embassy s environment science and health sections who met with the wiv scientists the state department declined to comment on this and other details of the story the chinese researchers at wiv were receiving assistance from the galveston national laboratory at the university of texas medical branch and other u s organizations but the chinese requested additional help the cables argued that the united states should give the wuhan lab further support mainly because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous as the cable noted the u s visitors met with shi zhengli the head of the research project who had been publishing studies related to bat coronaviruses for many years in november 2017 just before the u s officials visit shi s team had published research showing that horseshoe bats they had collected from a cave in yunnan province were very likely from the same bat population that spawned the sars coronavirus in 2003 sign up for our coronavirus updates newsletter to track the outbreak all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access most importantly the cable states the researchers also showed that various sars like coronaviruses can interact with ace2 the human receptor identified for sars coronavirus this finding strongly suggests that sars like coronaviruses from bats can be transmitted to humans to cause sars like diseases from a public health perspective this makes the continued surveillance of sars like coronaviruses in bats and study of the animal human interface critical to future emerging coronavirus outbreak prediction and prevention the research was designed to prevent the next sars like pandemic by anticipating how it might emerge but even in 2015 other scientists questioned whether shi s team was taking unnecessary risks in october 2014 the u s government had imposed a moratorium on funding of any research that makes a virus more deadly or contagious known as gain of function experiments as many have pointed out there is no evidence that the virus now plaguing the world was engineered scientists largely agree it came from animals but that is not the same as saying it didn t come from the lab which spent years testing bat coronaviruses in animals said xiao qiang a research scientist at the school of information at the university of california at berkeley the cable tells us that there have long been concerns about the possibility of the threat to public health that came from this lab s research if it was not being adequately conducted and protected he said there are similar concerns about the nearby wuhan center for disease control and prevention lab which operates at biosecurity level 2 a level significantly less secure than the level 4 standard claimed by the wuhan insititute of virology lab xiao said that s important because the chinese government still refuses to answer basic questions about the origin of the novel coronavirus while suppressing any attempts to examine whether either lab was involved sources familiar with the cables said they were meant to sound an alarm about the grave safety concerns at the wiv lab especially regarding its work with bat coronaviruses the embassy officials were calling for more u s attention to this lab and more support for it to help it fix its problems the cable was a warning shot one u s official said they were begging people to pay attention to what was going on no extra assistance to the labs was provided by the u s government in response to these cables the cables began to circulate again inside the administration over the past two months as officials debated whether the lab could be the origin of the pandemic and what the implications would be for the u s pandemic response and relations with china inside the trump administration many national security officials have long suspected either the wiv or the wuhan center for disease control and prevention lab was the source of the novel coronavirus outbreak according to the new york times the intelligence community has provided no evidence to confirm this but one senior administration official told me that the cables provide one more piece of evidence to support the possibility that the pandemic is the result of a lab accident in wuhan the idea that it was just a totally natural occurrence is circumstantial the evidence it leaked from the lab is circumstantial right now the ledger on the side of it leaking from the lab is packed with bullet points and there s almost nothing on the other side the official said as my colleague david ignatius noted the chinese government s original story that the virus emerged from a seafood market in wuhan is shaky research by chinese experts published in the lancet in january showed the first known patient identified on dec 1 had no connection to the market nor did more than one third of the cases in the first large cluster also the market didn t sell bats the opinions section is looking for stories of how the coronavirus has affected people of all walks of life write to us shi and other wiv researchers have categorically denied this lab was the origin for the novel coronavirus on feb 3 her team was the first to publicly report the virus known as 2019 ncov was a bat derived coronavirus the chinese government meanwhile has put a total lockdown on information related to the virus origins beijing has yet to provide u s experts with samples of the novel coronavirus collected from the earliest cases the shanghai lab that published the novel coronavirus genome on jan 11 was quickly shut down by authorities for rectification several of the doctors and journalists who reported on the spread early on have disappeared on feb 14 chinese president xi jinping called for a new biosecurity law to be accelerated on wednesday cnn reported the chinese government has placed severe restrictions requiring approval before any research institution publishes anything on the origin of the novel coronavirus the origin story is not just about blame it s crucial to understanding how the novel coronavirus pandemic started because that informs how to prevent the next one the chinese government must be transparent and answer the questions about the wuhan labs because they are vital to our scientific understanding of the virus said xiao we don t know whether the novel coronavirus originated in the wuhan lab but the cable pointed to the danger there and increases the impetus to find out he said i don t think it s a conspiracy theory i think it s a legitimate question that needs to be investigated and answered he said to understand exactly how this originated is critical knowledge for preventing this from happening in the future read more read this piece in chinese read this piece in spanish david ignatius how did covid 19 begin its initial
