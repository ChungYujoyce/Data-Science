in the wake of donald trump s abortion gaffes it should finally be clear that trump is not a real conservative he is the liberal caricature of a conservative in his now infamous interview with chris matthews trump not only declared that if abortion became illegal women who have abortions should face some form of punishment but also asserted that conservatives republicans would say yes they should be punished no they would not this is not something a real pro life conservative would say it is something a liberal pretending to be a pro life conservative would say anyone remotely familiar with the pro life cause knows that its advocates don t want to punish women marjorie dannenfelser president of the susan b anthony list explains that the focus of laws restricting abortion is on protection not punishment women were not punished by the legal system before 1973 s roe v wade decision and there is absolutely no drive to punish her now as mother teresa famously put it abortion is profoundly anti women three quarters of its victims are women half the babies and all the mothers trump does not understand this because he is deeply unfamiliar with what motivates pro life americans the goal of the pro life movement is to create a culture of life that upholds the dignity of every human person from conception to natural death the objective is not punishment it is to protect both mother and child since trump does not actually understand what pro life conservatives truly believe he mindlessly echoes the liberal caricature of pro life conservatives he mistakenly thinks this is what these conservatives want to hear they don t this is however what liberals want to hear they want a republican candidate who feeds their false war on women narrative they want to run against the caricature of the pro life position because the caricature is ugly and trump is giving them precisely what they want if that were not bad enough trump then went on to compound his problems by reversing himself in an interview with john dickerson on face the nation trump said that he would not change the law to protect innocent unborn life declaring that the laws are set at this moment the laws are set and i think we have to leave it that way leave it that way this is something no pro life conservative would say it s not even something a liberal pretending to be a pro life conservative would say it s something hillary clinton would say trump then twice declined to answer when asked whether he thought abortion is murder saying i d rather not comment on it and i just don t think it s an appropriate forum before finally on the third try grudgingly saying i don t disagree quite the profile in pro life courage trump likes to say he is a convert to the pro life cause just like ronald reagan but reagan would never have said that laws allowing abortion on demand should not be changed as president reagan supported the human life bill which would have recognized the unborn as human beings and protected them as persons under our constitution reagan would also never have said that women should be punished for having abortions in his 1983 essay for the human life review abortion and the conscience of a nation reagan declared we should not rest until our entire society echoes the tone of john powell in the dedication of his book abortion the silent holocaust a dedication to every woman carrying an unwanted child please believe that you are not alone there are many of us that truly love you who want to stand at your side and help in any way we can much like when trump referred to two corinthians instead of second corinthians his comments on abortion are a tell demonstrating that he does not possess a basic understanding of the first principles that animate conservative thought on the sanctity of life so let s stop the charade when it comes to the issue of life donald trump is a caricature not a conservative read more from marc thiessen s archive follow him on twitter or subscribe to his updates on facebook we are a participant in the amazon services llc associates program an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon com and affiliated sites
