it s the first day with a whole lot of delegates at stake and it will shape the future of the contest the first day of the democratic contest that really matters for the cold hard delegate math super tuesday is almost here follow our live results here tuesday march 3 will be enormously important because it s the first day that a lot of the delegates necessary to win the nomination are at stake and the biggest delegate day overall a total of 14 states and one territory including california and texas the two most populous states in the country will hold their primaries or caucuses candidates are competing for about a third of the overall delegates at stake those 1 344 delegates allocated on super tuesday could effectively settle the race if one candidate locks down a gigantic lead that will be nearly impossible for anyone else to overcome the candidate with the best chance of doing that is sen bernie sanders his current lead in national polls and strong position in some big super tuesday states indicate he could rack up enough plurality wins in a crowded field to clean up in delegates some recent polls however have shown late movement toward joe biden which could spoil those plans related it s also possible that super tuesday s delegate haul ends up split among several candidates with no one having gotten anywhere close to being on track for a majority that may well mean democrats are headed to a contested convention whether we re headed for one of these outcomes or something in between depends to a significant extent on democrats complicated delegate allocation rules broadly delegates are allotted proportionally based on candidates performance the better you do the more delegates you get but quirks in the rules mean relatively small differences in the exact split of the votes can lead to large differences in delegates we ll get into the nitty gritty below the big picture is that if one person ends up with a commanding lead and gets nearly half the delegates that candidate will become the overwhelming favorite for the nomination but if the delegate leader has a narrow edge and is well below half of the delegates a long close fought contest will likely ensue it s simple there are a whole lot of delegates at stake the way to win the democratic nomination is by winning delegates specifically winning 1 991 out of 3 979 pledged delegates enough for a majority to get the nomination at the democratic national convention and there are 1 344 delegates one third of the total up for grabs in super tuesday s contests though there will be several more months of primaries remaining it s possible that super tuesday can settle the nomination contest it s not mathematically possible to reach the magic number of delegates yet but al gore in 2000 and john kerry in 2004 won so convincingly on super tuesday that their opponents quit shortly afterward yet super tuesday can also pave the way for a very long race in 2008 hillary clinton and barack obama ended up nearly tied after an early february super tuesday and they battled it out through four months of remaining contests in 2016 clinton locked in a solid advantage over sanders on super tuesday that she never relinquished but it wasn t such an overwhelmingly dominant performance as to drive sanders to quit the race so he stayed in no one person or group dictates the primary calendar from the top down the national democratic and republican parties have declared that the month of february is reserved only for the four early states iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina but after that it s just up to states to schedule primaries whenever they want between march and june many states that want to influence the outcome of the nomination have calculated that the best way to do that is to go as early as possible on the first tuesday in march this dynamic has been called frontloading super tuesday actually began as a plot to help president jimmy carter stave off a primary challenge from ted kennedy in 1980 as carter s strategists got three large southern states where he was expected to do well to schedule their primaries early from 1984 through 1992 other southern states joined in an attempt to give their region more influence as did a few non southern states eventually big states from elsewhere in the country wanted in and the first super tuesday that truly spanned the nation took place in 2000 that s been the norm ever since though the exact lineup varies from cycle to cycle as states move their nominating contests around super tuesday 2008 is still the record holder for the number of states and the proportion of the total delegates at stake from most delegates at stake to least they are another contest involving democrats abroad democratic voters living overseas will begin on super tuesday but won t end until march 10 so it s those 14 states and one territory that will have their voting conclude on super tuesday with 1 344 delegates at stake overall that s a lot to get your head around so it can be helpful to break down the lineup into groups finally it s worth remembering that even though super tuesday is just one day several of the states involved began early voting or mail balloting weeks ago so a chunk of the vote will have been locked in before tuesday itself in one sense the way to ensure super tuesday delegate dominance is simple win by a lot in a lot of places if sanders or anyone else manages to do that they ll end up with a big delegate lead but if most outcomes are closer or if the results are mixed the delegate situation will be highly contingent on the exact breakdown of the vote because of democrats complex delegate allocation rules democrats have no winner take all states where whoever comes in first place gets all that state s delegates instead they allot delegates proportionally based on each contest s results that means winning isn t all that matters the margin of victory is crucial a narrow win will barely provide an advantage in the delegate count because proportional rules mean the second place finisher usually gets close to the same amount of delegates but winning in a landslide will provide a big delegate edge beyond that the devil is in the details particularly when the field is still larger than usual first off there s the threshold candidates need to get 15 percent of the vote somewhere to get any delegates there those below 15 percent are nonviable and get nothing second it s not quite so simple as 30 percent of the vote gets you 30 percent of delegates instead it s your percentage of the viable candidates vote that matters basically votes for any candidate who s below 15 percent are excluded and your percentage of whatever s left determines your share of delegates so let s say you get 30 percent of the vote but there are three other viable candidates getting 25 percent 20 percent and 15 percent of the vote the viable vote adds up to 90 percent and your 30 percent is one third of that so you get one third of the delegates here s how it would play out under a sample scenario if there were 10 delegates at stake note former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg and sen amy klobuchar dropped out of the race just before super tuesday a very different situation transpires if you get 30 percent of the vote and only one other candidate is viable getting 20 percent with the rest of the vote split among several others the viable vote would then add up to 50 percent your 30 percent is three fifths of that so you get many more of the delegates at stake this means a great deal can depend on the exact breakdown of the vote particularly in big states with many delegates at stake finally as if all this wasn t enough a candidate s statewide performance is not all that matters for delegates the majority of the super tuesday delegates about 65 percent are in fact allotted based on results in individual districts mostly congressional districts except for texas which uses state senate districts instead proportional allocation with a 15 percent threshold applies separately in all these districts that means that if you do well in a state overall but are at 14 percent in a district there you ll get zero of that district s delegates take california there are 415 total delegates at stake there but only 144 of them will be awarded proportionally based on statewide results the other 271 are divvied out according to the proportional results in california s 53 congressional districts with 4 7 delegates at stake in each district it s all quite complicated but all in all super tuesday is a contest to top 15 percent by as much as possible in as many places states and districts as possible every time candidates get zeroed out by falling below the threshold is bad news for them well technically you don t win the democratic nomination just by winning more delegates than anyone else the party s rules state that you need an outright majority of the 3 979 pledged delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot so another key thing to watch for in the super tuesday results is whether the delegate leader is on track for an actual majority or if not just how far off track they are from it again democrats lack of winner take all states makes this question very important the problem is that those proportional delegate allocation rules make it difficult to rack up large delegate advantages again narrow wins in states result in the delegates being split to gain the upper hand you can t just win states you have to win big so if the leading candidate is significantly off track from a majority after the super tuesday delegate haul is locked in he or she may never get back on track for one paving the way to a contested convention in which no candidate wins the majority on the first ballot something that s never occurred in the modern nomination system that s the theory anyway many believe that in practice democrats would face enormous pressure to give the nomination to whoever wins the most delegates even if that person is short of a majority the specifics could depend on just how big that first place person s lead is and how close to a majority they end up which shows why again the delegate details of super tuesday are crucial overall despite all the drama in the democratic contest so far it s important to remember that barely any delegates just 4 percent of the total will have been allotted before super tuesday so while the expectation now is that bernie sanders is the frontrunner and polls appear to back that up this won t really be set in stone until we see how he and everyone else does on super tuesday sanders could as many now expect win most states by significant margins and build a sizable delegate lead that will carry him to the nomination but if there s a late swing to another candidate such as biden who just won big in south carolina on saturday sanders could also lose his frontrunner status quite quickly for the other candidates who have had more mixed outcomes or little success super tuesday is really do or die if you don t get a significant chunk of the super tuesday delegates it becomes all but impossible to get a pledged delegate majority super tuesday is also the first electoral test for former new york city mayor mike bloomberg who has spent half a billion dollars on advertising across the country but skipped the four early states bloomberg rose in national polls and in polls of super tuesday states over the past month but scrutiny of his past and his rocky performance in the democratic las vegas debate have lately sent his numbers in the other direction but the crowded field this year means that depending on how the ball bounces on march 3 there are several possible outcomes with very different implications for the race here are the main ones finally it s entirely possible that we won t actually know the super tuesday outcome on super tuesday for instance california takes a famously long time to count votes due to the need to verify late arriving mailed ballots and the exact vote shares and margins both statewide and in its 53 congressional districts could be important if one candidate does end up winning almost everywhere that wrinkle might not be such a big deal but in this nomination contest so far it s usually prudent to expect that things could get messy correction a previous version of a lead graphic showed incorrect information on the states holding elections on super tuesday
