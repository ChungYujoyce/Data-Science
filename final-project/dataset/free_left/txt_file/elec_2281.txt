wisconsin governor and cardboard cutout of himself scott walker went into wednesday s debate with a mission he needed a breakout performance to reestablish himself as a legitimate candidate for the white house after seeing his once formidable polling numbers plummet into the low single digits and to kick things off he employed the reliable tool of the attention desperate debate participant the zinger mustering the trace amounts of bile his pasty midwestern frame is capable of producing walker turned to donald trump the 2016 candidate whose political fortunes have risen as walker s have cratered and delivered his carefully prepared zing payload we don t need an apprentice in the white house walker said we have one right now it was a reference to donald trump s former show the apprentice but walker seemed to be under the impression that the apprentice referenced in the show s title was trump that s not how the show worked donald trump was not the apprentice the joke made no sense a few people in the audience laughed probably because they re idiots who laugh at anything jeb bush standing between walker and trump paused for a moment to work out what walker was getting at then offered a sympathetic nod and closed lip good job good effort smile the canned line had flopped and trump remained wholly un zung this misfired zinger would be walker s high point for the debate for the remaining two plus hours of the event he would field just two direct questions and spend less time speaking than any other candidate for a candidate looking to use wednesday s debate to reassure his restive donors that everything is ok it was kind of a disaster facing mounting questions about his uncertain political future and his persistent inability to meet expectations walker is tweaking his campaign strategy and focusing all his efforts on winning iowa i think we re putting all our eggs in the basket of iowa walker told msnbc following the debate we re committed to iowa and i think that ll help us make the case all throughout the country winning iowa was always a key component of walker s strategy but now he s moving staff and resources from other states and planning to double the amount of time he spends within iowa s borders team walker is insisting that this was always going to be their plan but it s hard to believe that the redoubled focus on iowa isn t a reaction to his 10 point drop in the iowa polls since late may it s a risky strategy first of all it puts walker in the same company as some other famous losers who peaked early flamed out and pegged what dwindling chance they had on winning iowa people like michele bachmann and rick perry it s hard to view what walker is doing as anything other than a forced downscaling aimed squarely at political preservation and the track record for success for candidates who ve made a similar calculation is not good another reason a tight and obsessive focus on iowa is dangerous for republican candidates is that it forces you to be crazy iowa republicans are very white and very conservative which makes the state the preferred playground for low polling also ran candidates who want to make the case that they are the only true conservative in the race to win the hearts of the iowa gop caucus goers you re competing against candidates who are forever shifting further and further to the right to win over social conservatives think about mike huckabee winner of the 2008 iowa caucus whose 2016 campaign has thus far been a series of insane attacks on gay marriage and the supreme court there are more serious threats in candidates like ben carson and ted cruz who speak the language of social conservatives and make strong claims to outsider and anti establishment credibility walker will have to out compete all these nutbars while overcoming his complete lack of any discernible personality and then there s the question of what comes after iowa when you ve set up iowa as the must win state for your campaign you re setting the expectation that anything other than resounding victory will doom your chances a strong showing won t do and even if he does win it will likely come with significant liabilities spending several months catering to hard line conservative voters in iowa makes it very difficult to inch back toward the center without looking like a hypocrite or a flake but walker doesn t really have a choice earlier in the year he set up iowa as his contest of choice the state in which he would demonstrate his effortless dominance of the republican field now that he s crashing in the polls it s serving as his very crowded lifeboat copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
