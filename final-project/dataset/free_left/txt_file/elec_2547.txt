beer march 12 in a packed o donold s irish pub and grill in youngstown ohio ryan has trekked to dozens of events across his home state to help elect the former secretary of state ap photo rep jim himes has raised hundreds of thousands as a bundler for hillary clinton rep tim ryan trekked to dozens of events across his home state of ohio to help elect the former secretary of state rep emanuel cleaver risked political suicide in 2008 by sticking with clinton when african american politicians and voters were flocking to barack obama s insurgent campaign the clinton foot soldiers are among the members of congress who may be in line for a nice return on their hard work if she wins in november a job in the new administration perhaps increased political clout or help from the commander in chief reaching the next rung on the political ladder advertisement the clintons value loyalty anyone who has been in politics for a long time values loyalty said rep john larson d conn a close ally of former president bill clinton for anyone who has been involved in helping to elect clinton they can see this as an opportunity indeed being an early and aggressive supporter of clinton has the potential to propel careers forward rep john delaney d md has discussed running for governor or senate while colorado rep jared polis wants to join the ranks of democratic leadership having made a previous bid to chair the party s house campaign arm both are top bundlers for clinton a distinction earned after an individual raises 100 000 or more in primary election contributions for the campaign and her support as president would certainly aid their ambitions 2016 by alexander cohen other top clinton supporters on capitol hill include democratic reps nita lowey of new york marcia fudge of ohio steve israel of new york and assistant democratic leader jim clyburn of south carolina as prominent clinton bundlers freshman reps don beyer d va and grace meng d n y also make the list reps lois frankel d fla judy chu d calif and jim cooper d tenn are making significant efforts on clinton s behalf as well a number of senators from ohio s sherrod brown to virginia s tim kaine consistently make the list of potential picks for clinton s no 2 and new jersey sen cory booker has been floated as a potential pick for a white house post because of his broad appeal among progressives and younger voters on the house side sources close to the clinton campaign on capitol hill say ohio s ryan or new york s lowey could be poised to join a clinton administration in some capacity i think tim is a prospect either for vice president or certainly in the cabinet if he were to desire it larson said ryan would be a long shot for the no 2 job but he s a well regarded centrist from a critical swing state another house member whose name has cropped up is rep xavier becerra d calif he is limited from seeking another term as chairman of the democratic caucus and has been casting a wide net for his next landing place the 12 term congressman spent several weeks campaigning for clinton in nevada before the caucus there and some of his allies are speculating he could be making a bid for a cabinet post or even vice president becerra is someone i think would make a great vice president of the united states rep mike honda d calif remarked earlier this month becerra is a dark horse at best to become clinton s running mate there s also a cadre of clinton allies who stayed with her during her acrimonious primary battle against obama eight years ago that group includes cleaver and new york rep joe crowley crowley has had a long standing relationship with the clintons and it was strengthened when he became one of her earliest endorsers in congress last year he s in line to chair the democratic caucus next congress the no 4 spot in house democratic leadership having a close relationship with the white house could help him push forward the democrats agenda in a congress that will likely still be controlled by republicans cleaver who campaigned in missouri for clinton ahead of the state s mid march primary said he s not looking for anything in return i m a part of the clinton movement without expecting that i ll be moving anywhere i m not looking for anything i think they know that as well as anyone cleaver said by steven shepard but cleaver s support is notable he remained with clinton in 2008 and crisscrossed the south this year to rally support among black voters who powered clinton to a string of victories that stabilized her campaign cleaver said clinton has an active network of democratic backers on the hill because she understands the value of socializing with lawmakers after years of feeling largely shunned by obama who s eschewed the glad handing that was a hallmark of bill clinton s presidency elected democrats are eager to see another clinton in the white house it does not hurt for the president to have personal relationships with the senate and the house it s not bad for the president to be able to pick up the phone and say hey can you come over at 6 p m tonight he said and when you pick up the cellphone you know there is a relationship there missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020 politico llc
