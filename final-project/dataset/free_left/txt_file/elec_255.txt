politico s ben white talks to a number of wall street executives and discovers that they are growing increasingly terrified that donald trump could actually win the republican nomination for president trump has vowed to raise taxes on capital gains claiming that executive pay in america is a complete joke one senior figure on wall street tells politico that investors who discussed trump at a recent lunch were taking him very seriously adding he taps into frustrations that are very real and he is a master manipulator of the media trump responded by sending a statement to politico that you should pay very close attention to trump is explicitly saying that the low tax rates paid by wall streeters and hedge funders are ripping off the american people and that his rivals for the presidency will continue letting them get away with it when it comes to taxing the rich clinton is unlikely to match bernie sanders eventual proposals but clinton is likely to propose tax hikes on capital gains and inherited wealth clinton may be perceived as close to wall street but in the end her proposals could end up looking somewhat like his this is presuming he will roll out an actual proposal that is consistent with what he is saying now what s more immediately relevant here is the challenge this represents to trump s fellow republicans and to the gop after barack obama defeated mitt romney in part by casting him as a plutocrats dream candidate republicans launched an ambitious effort to rebrand the party as deeply concerned with stagnating wages stalled economic mobility and soaring inequality paul ryan who d emerged as the gop s guiding light on economic matters by crafting a vision that would massively redistribute wealth upwards quietly launched a poverty tour that wasn t quite quiet enough to stay out of the newspapers marco rubio gave high profile speeches about poverty and the middle class jeb bush s first big economic speech waxed lyrical about the moral scourge of stunted opportunity we have now seen tax plans from the gop candidates and despite their populist packaging it turns out asramesh ponnuru puts it that all of them would also ensure that the top one percent comes out way ahead the rubio and bush plans contain middle class tax relief but when viewed in the larger context of who would benefit most from them it has the feel of political window dressing as ponnuru concludes republicans would probably be better off in the general election next year if their plans weren t quite so favorable to the rich the gop candidates apparently think they can cite their plans middle class tax relief combined with soothing supply side sweet nothings to make the cuts for the rich more palatable in a general election bush s campaign has road tested the argument that his plan would result in top earners paying a larger share of the overall tax burden which is a diversion rubio has gamely suggested that his plan s elimination of taxes on capital gains and dividends would help create jobs for bartenders like his father but trump s suggestion that his rivals will let wall streeters get away with paying too little in taxes threatens to let republican voters in on the joke ross douthat has suggested that as a billionaire trump could actually be more credible in this regard since he is letting you in on the secret from the inside that high finance can afford higher taxes and guess what trump seems to be saying it won t destroy the economy or cost your bartender father his job trump has been in on the joke for a long time and the joke s on you but the joke is over get ready for trump versus fiorina the new york times reports that republicans expect a massive confrontation between donald trump and rival carly fiorina at tomorrow s gop debate trump vows to refrain from criticizing her looks as he had previously done of course trump isn t exactly a paragon of self control and he may slip up after all it isn t as if his previous barrage of insults directed at women or immigrants or any other group has damaged his standing among gop voters carson mentum rages out of control a new new york times cbs poll finds that ben carson has pulled close to even with trump the retired neurosurgeon has 23 percent of republican voters nationally to trump s 27 percent apparently gop primary voters don t think much yet of all the republicans running who have actual governing experience clinton super pac attacks sanders the huffington post reports on a new ad campaign from pro hillary clinton super pac correct the record clinton s camp has long maintained it won t attack sanders directly and one imagines this attack will be disavowed rather quickly gop leaders cook up scheme to avoid shutdown gop leaders are set to hold votes attacking planned parenthood in hopes that this will allow conservatives to vent anger and lead them to stop demanding that any funding of government defunds the group hey it s worth a try right presidential campaign complicates budget mess the hill reports that conservatives are warning that the gop presidential candidates will all oppose any bipartisan deal to keep the government open if it increases spending levels by one penny the gop primary perhaps makes it more likely that congressional conservatives will hold the line against any more spending the question then will be what kind of leverage dems can garner from the fact that gop leaders will need their support to keep the government open republicans set to debate foreign policy the wall street journal raises the curtain on tomorrow night s gop debate about foreign policy noting that there appear to be real differences between the candidates over how far to go in fighting isis one other thing to watch for trump has mocked his gop rivals for saying they would scrap the iran deal on day one so it ll be interesting to see if he keeps that up and what results from it and trump again attacks illegal immigrants trump had this to say at a raucous rally last night a dumping ground for the rest of the world they re all over the place gosh the source of trump s appeal to republican voters is so mysterious receive the most important
