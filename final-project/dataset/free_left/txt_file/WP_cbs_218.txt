coronavirus pandemic in one of the hardest hit communities in the nation watch the cbs news special bravery and hope 7 days on the front line friday may 15 at 9 p m et pt on cbs re airing saturday and sunday at 10 p m et on cbsn by mid april the coronavirus had killed more people in new york than anywhere else and of the city s five boroughs the bronx was the hardest hit very few journalists had spent time in hospitals on the front lines and i had just signed up for seven days and nights inside a covid stricken hospital to document what the health care workers on the front lines were experiencing i was not just making a decision about putting my own health at risk i was making a decision for my wife and two young children too my wife and i talked it through a lot and she saw it clearly this is your job to go and tell their stories accepting the risk just like they do before dawn on day 2 i drove out to fort totten in queens where ems crews of the new york city fire department assemble first thing in the morning preparing to fan out across the city and respond to emergency calls that s where i met chris feliciano a paramedic who had recovered from coronavirus himself and was now back to work this is worse than 9 11 feliciano told me i say that because 9 11 was just one day and unfortunately over 3 000 people died in that one day but we re seeing numbers well above that and this is continuous this is not just one day this is daily and the bodies keep piling up the calls never stopped within 10 minutes of treating one patient the ambulance lights would flash the siren would blare and we would be racing again through the streets of the bronx shortness of breath was the most common symptom from patients they were scared and said as much and they faced a grim reality going to the hospital could be more dangerous than trying to recover at home because the hospitals are so overwhelmed it s a mass casualty incident at the moment with the city feliciano said we would generally get cardiac arrests about once or twice a week but now it s just happening at all hours of the day at a small row house later that morning we arrived too late for the elderly man inside he was pronounced d o a dead on arrival the volume of calls forced fdny to put a new protocol in place we will try for 20 minutes to resuscitate a patient feliciano said if there s no response to our interventions we would have to pronounce on scene overwhelmed with patients montefiore medical center the largest hospital in the bronx transformed a giant meeting hall into a covid 19 ward the moment i walked in for the first time a young doctor said to me there s a 22 year old ambulance worker here you should talk with him in one of the dozens of makeshift rooms i pulled back the curtain and found cristian camas he lay on his hospital bed working hard to breathe a rosary hung on the bedside railing sweat beaded down his forehead it was like a buffalo was on my chest he kept saying describing how the disease had overcome him telling his story he echoed a haunting refrain he repeated again and again i didn t think i was going to make it camas worked for a private ambulance company and likely contracted the virus while helping to save the lives of others we facetimed with cristian s father who lived in the south bronx despite everything that was happening he invited me to their home cristian s mother explained that an uncle had recently died cristian s 13 year old brother erik was worried about the rest of the family there was a moment here where i was by myself because my mom she started feeling sick too said erik cristian s 13 year old brother i imagine myself without any of them and i knew that i couldn t do anything without them it was horrible before a table bearing a bible and a candle erik led the family in prayer asking god for cristian to come home safely three days later his prayers were answered cristian was one of the 314 patients discharged from the hospital over the week we were there the last night of shooting was a wednesday near the end of april it was chilly and clear out i went into the hospital to follow dr michelle gong chief of critical care for one more night shift i geared up full body tyvek suit surgical gloves n95 covered with a surgical mask full face plastic shield and it took less than 10 minutes for a code to come it was an urgent call for rapid response to a patient in distress a team of doctors swarmed a crashing patient more human bodies in a single patient s room than i imagined was possible nurses scrambled for supplies wrappers and plastic gloves flipped into the air left scattered on the hospital floor like emergency detritus i sweat through my ppe as i shot video of dr gong as she climbed onto the bed so she could push down on the patient s chest a procedure to determine if his body could handle being turned over they got the patient to the icu in the week we spent at the hospital covid took the lives of 70 people for seven days i d been pointing a camera at countless medical professionals as they raced to save lives strained to protect themselves from the virus as they laughed and celebrated small victories as they broke down and wept over endless death that had overwhelmed their lives what i didn t know was that for just a moment a colleague snapped a photo of me at work in all my time at montefiore i never thought i felt afraid then i saw the image it s undeniable what filled my eyes a new kind of fear andrew bast spent six seasons with 60 minutes and is now a producer for the cbs
