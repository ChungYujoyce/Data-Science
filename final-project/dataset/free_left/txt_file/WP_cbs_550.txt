shooting rampage in west texas yesterday afternoon cbs this morning lead national correspondent david begnaud is in odessa david david begnaud cbs this morning lead national correspondent margaret

the dead is a high school student a seventeen month old baby girl was shot behind me is where it all ended that s where you re going to see the police car and the mail postal service van as we zoom in what happened according to eyewitness video is the gunman who had hijacked the postal service van was driving right for a police car when officers opened fire on him here s more on how it all started begin vt david begnaud the gunman at some point ditched his vehicle and hijacked a u s postal service van and then he started shooting at people on the freeway man 1 he s shooting them he s shooting them david begnaud the gunman was killed in a shootout with police it happened right outside of a movie theater seven people are dead not including the shooter twenty one are injured among the injured

affiliate here in odessa texas was forced to evacuate while they were on the air as police swept the area near one of the crime scenes jay hendricks okay we re going to leave the set we re going to we re going to slip away just for a minute we don t know what s going on david begnaud there is no word yet on a motive overnight law enforcement officers worked multiple crime scenes throughout midland and odessa end vt david begnaud you know it s just about a month ago when we were outside that walmart in el paso texas because twenty two people were killed in a mass shooting there the state of texas has some of the most lenient gun laws in the country and just recently state lawmakers passed ten new bills further loosening gun restrictions margaret those new laws went into effect today margaret brennan david begnaud thank you and now to our other major story hurricane dorian has been upgraded to a catastrophic category 5 hurricane and is now threatening the bahamas cbs news climate and weather contributor jeff berardelli joins us from new york jeff jeff berardelli meteorologist weatherprof cbs news climate and weather contributor margaret this is about as strong as a hurricane can get in fact it s in the top ten of hurricanes in terms of its wind the winds are now up to a hundred and seventy five miles an hour this is going to be a catastrophic storm for the northern bahamas we re zoomed in hurricane force winds are now moving into places like marsh harbour and abaco islands and the strongest winds are just off shore it looks like it s going to be hitting the northern part of the island these are the latest stats and i can t believe how strong these winds are right now a hundred and seventy five as it gets close to land it s moving west at eight miles an hour and it s actually going to slow down and this is the most problematic part for the northern bahamas it s going to be moving extraordinarily slowly from today through tomorrow through tuesday it only covers a little over a hundred miles of territory it s probably only going to go two or three miles an hour or so and by tuesday morning it s still located over grand bahama island with winds around a hundred and forty miles an hour the whole time tropical storm force winds are spreading over the east coast of florida and notice the center of this track right here is only about forty miles offshore any closer and hurricane force winds go to the coast dangerous surf and flooding is likely coastal flooding along the beaches then the system kind of hooks right by the middle and end of the week it could weaken a little bit but we have to watch out for the possibility of a landfall somewhere in south carolina but more likely north carolina as we head towards the end of the upcoming week take a look at these wind gusts marsh harbour at least a hundred and twenty seven miles an hour we re going to see wind gusts likely over a hundred and sixty hundred and seventy miles an hour the model just is not able to show it that s how strong the winds are going to be and you could see that those hurricane force winds stay over grand bahama island for thirty six hours at the same time right here along the florida coast we re going to see tropical storm force wind gusts and any closer and hurricane force wind gusts will spread to places like boca west palm jupiter all the way up to stuart as we head into especially the tuesday timeframe that s when the strongest winds are going to be another aspect of this storm storm surge because of huge waves out in the atlantic fifty foot waves overspreading the bahamas the gulf stream which means a lot of coastal flooding as this moves north we have astronomically high tides the next couple of days because of a new moon so this is an interesting one right here that s how close the system is going to come to florida margaret margaret brennan jeff it s coming that close it sounds like there still is a direct threat to the people in florida jeff berardelli there is because there is no room for error this is the european model and you can see that hurricane force winds are only twenty miles off the coast of the palm beaches the treasure coast and eventually the space coast if this were to go any closer and again this is just one one model the european model but it s a good model that would put the hurricane force winds on shore so you have to be aware of that we re literally threading the needle and if the model is wrong by twenty miles which it could be that puts hurricane force winds right along the coast margaret margaret brennan all right jeff berardelli you ll be busy and we ll be watching jeff berardelli i will margaret brennan we want to go now to florida and cbs news national correspondent mark strassmann who is standing by in st augustine mark it looks pretty sunny mark strassmann cbs news correspondent good morning margaret it does but here s what people here remember besides all this picture perfect weather for this weekend three years ago hurricane matthew another category 5 storm that came up off the coast hit here this entire area was underwater on top of that the national hurricane center has a warning for all the amateur storm trackers who live here a florida landfall is still a distinct possibility for dorian so the blue skies look reassuring but for how long begin vt mark strassmann as dorian appears to track northward floridians wondered whether to breathe a sigh of relief after days of dire warnings hurried preparations and last minute stockpiling coastal residents know better than to completely relax dorian s heavy winds and coastal flooding are still potential threats as florida governor ron desantis reminded them ron desantis so floridians on the east coast need to be prepared if you have a plan stick to your plan if you haven t made preparations please do so we need to remain vigilant we re not out of the woods yet mark strassmann even if dorian s physical damage ends up being less than expected its menace has already been costly businesses lost millions when tourists fled right before labor day weekend leaving empty beaches and stores airport closures and canceled flights will prolong the losses into the week ahead utility crews from the north are already en route to florida georgia and the carolinas to help with any power outages but fewer than two hundred miles off the florida coast the northern bahamas are finding themselves not so lucky a category 5 storm now bears down on them the islands of abaco and grand bahama sit squarely in dorian s path residents were stocking up and boarding up in anticipation of a direct hit end vt mark strassmann southeast coastal u s states know they could still be in the bull s eye south carolina s governor has declared a state of emergency georgia and north carolina are tracking the storm closely dorian remains a menace margaret margaret brennan mark thank you we turn now to acting homeland security secretary kevin mcaleenan he is monitoring the storm from fema headquarters here in washington good morning kevin mcaleenan homeland security acting secretary dhsmcaleenan good morning how are you margaret margaret brennan very well what can you tell us about the latest path of what is now a category 5 storm kevin mcaleenan right this storm just strengthened into a category 5 which means there are sustained winds over a hundred and fifty six miles an hour it s now starting to hit the northern islands of the bahamas and it s moving slowly westward it s going to impact those islands pretty significantly and then we expect it to stall out about sixty miles off the florida coast that s where most models show it holding for over twenty four hours before it starts moving in a in a northerly direction and staying most likely offshore of florida georgia and south carolina margaret brennan so you are not projecting landfall in the united states at this point kevin mcaleenan correct but that does not mean there s not going to be significant impacts from the storm we expect to see hurricane force winds lashing the coastline of florida as soon as tuesday we expect a storm surge is going to be significant and concerning as well as a prolonged rain event as the storm makes its way north margaret brennan how often are you briefing the president on this kevin mcaleenan regularly i i briefed him yesterday afternoon he s going to be here in a few hours with other partners from the cabinet to talk about our preparation so it s a it s a constant cycle and you can hear we ve got a very busy operations floor behind me at the national response coordination center with the entire federal government response effort being coordinated with over two hundred professionals trying to be as prepared as possible for any contingency with this storm margaret brennan you know this week that speaker pelosi called it stunningly reckless for homeland security to have transferred about a hundred and fifty million dollars out of the fema disaster relief fund to the border are you looking at freezing these funds i mean how do you respond to this criticism kevin mcaleenan i i would say she s badly misinformed about the impact there will be no impact of the potential reprogramming on our ability to respond to this storm the disaster recovery fund for major disasters has over twenty five billion dollars in it we re talking about a hundred and fifty five million in a base level fund we believe we have fully adequate funding and no money has actually been moved at this point to begin with so she s not informed margaret brennan when you say potential reprogramming and no money has been moved does that mean you may stop this kevin mcaleenan well let me tell you this is a funding we ask for from congress in the emergency supplemental funding that we anticipated we would need for the humanitarian crisis at the border which has raised concern across congress so this is money that we asked for we didn t receive margaret brennan right kevin mcaleenan and so we ve we ve identified sources across the department to help backfill that and we re going to monitor that very carefully we ve got to manage two crises at the same time and again we have plenty of funding in the disaster recovery fund margaret brennan so are you going to touch this money or not kevin mcaleenan so no money has been transferred at this time we ll continue to monitor the impacts margaret brennan but you may kevin mcaleenan we have plenty of funding margaret brennan still go ahead with it kevin mcaleenan yes we had to notify congress back in july of the potential for reprogramming we do have an ongoing border security humanitarian crisis and that funding was identified as critical to manage that as well margaret brennan so no operational impact no preparedness impact for you you can say kevin mcaleenan none whatsoever margaret brennan that unequivocally kevin mcaleenan none whatsoever i can say that unequivocally margaret brennan the the washington post and the new york times i i m sure you saw this week had stories that the president had ordered some land seizures to build his border wall is that what you re looking at land seizures kevin mcaleenan so we we re building the wall consistent with federal law we have a waiver authority for construction for for environmental laws and other laws we also have the ability to for federal government to buy land and that goes through a regular process through the courts and that s how we re proceeding and we ve been purchasing land for additional border barrier for for many months now and that s how we intend to continue progress margaret brennan because you know that one of the concerns and criticisms democrats are raising is that you are going to be so focused on immigration and the border that it will distract you from the other duties involved with your job including hurricane response disaster response how do you respond to that kevin mcaleenan so i m not distracted and i can assure you the fema leadership here is not distracted we have hundreds of professionals who have tremendous experience in monitoring and responding to storms and they are doing their job right here behind me right now and i m here supporting them we also we have a multi mission focus always at the department of homeland security we re working on the transportation security side we re working on responses to domestic terrorism incidents so we have a lot going on at the department and we re going to stay focused on all those missions in support of the protection of the american people margaret brennan so how should people be prepared in the zones you are watching right now for this hurricane kevin mcaleenan so they should be listening to their state and local emergency managers and following their instructions if there s a mandatory evacuation order they need to respond immediately if there s a voluntary evacuation order they should consider it in the meantime they need to be prepared they need seven days worth of supplies fuel food water medicine if necessary pet food they ve got to be thinking about all these things so that they re ready for any contingency with this storm margaret brennan and those are in the zones you highlighted earlier very quickly i want to ask you about what happened yesterday in texas can you tell us anything about what happened in midland and odessa is the public safe kevin mcaleenan so we re following that incident very closely it s way too soon in the investigation to jump to any conclusions about what happened or the motivations or why but we re supporting our state and locals and our heart goes out to the victims and their families margaret brennan all right good luck with the response today and we will be tracking the storm as well we ll be back in one minute with a lot more face the nation don t go away announcements margaret brennan we are now joined by 2020 democratic presidential candidate and former texas congressman beto o rourke he s here in studio good to have you here beto o rourke 2020 democratic presidential candidate betoorourke thank you for having me margaret brennan and we are following what has happened in your home state overnight you ve said americans have functionally accepted as our fate mass shootings are just going to occur how would your policies have prevented what happened in odessa and midland beto o rourke yeah i m also thinking about the people in the permian basin in west texas and midland and odessa right now and i want to make sure that we take action on their behalf and on behalf of everyone in this country universal background checks that close every loophole red flag laws to stop people who have firearms before it is too late if they pose a danger to themselves or someone else ending the sale of weapons of war ar 15 s and ak 47 s they were designed to kill people as effectively as efficiently in as great a number as possible margaret brennan do we know that that was the type of weapon used in this shooting beto o rourke we don t know but in el paso it was a variant of an ak 47 that killed twenty two people and grievously injured many more these are weapons of war and they re used as instruments of terror in our country and so i think in addition to those steps that i just described it is really important that we buy back those weapons of war that are out on our streets right now millions of them and also ensure that there is a national licensing and gun registry program we have in this country more than three hundred and ninety million guns in a nation of three hundred and twenty nine million people that is a big part of the reason that we lose forty thousand of our fellow americans every year and we cannot accept this anymore we ve got to follow the lead of those moms who demand action the students who are marching for our lives who themselves have announced ambitious plans to ensure that we can protect one another and that our kids don t have to fear going to school or the future of this country margaret brennan but in your home state of texas about thirty five percent of people are gun owners and today even more lenient laws go into effect allowing people to carry weapons into many different places so do you blame local government there because all the prescriptions you re laying out are federal solutions beto o rourke yeah let let s not blame anyone let s all take responsibility to make this right so i ve talked to gun owners and non gun owners in every one of the two hundred and fifty four counties of texas they re all there on universal background checks and red flag laws i was at a gun show in conway arkansas talking to owners of ar 15 s and ak 47 s some of them were open to a mandatory buyback program all of them agreed that we have a crisis and an epidemic of gun violence so margaret brennan but do you think public opinion in texas is changing i mean in those places beto o rourke it s there margaret brennan that have been seen as really beto o rourke yeah margaret brennan impossible to change laws and convictions that are strongly behind the second amendment beto o rourke i remember a woman in brownwood texas republican rural conservative community said i was born with a twenty two in my hands but i also have more than twenty grandchildren and i want to know whether you re going to represent them or the nra though she s a gun owner though she s conservative she wants us to take common sense practical steps to protect her grandkids to protect people all over this country so yes the people of america are there that leadership the the courage of our convictions just needs to be reflected in our national leadership making sure that we re listening to people not the nra people not pacs people not corporations when we do that we will save the lives of people margaret brennan but for your solutions so far policy prescriptions you don t know that it would have prevented what happened in midland and odessa beto o rourke we re still obviously learning the details listened to the press conference last night from the chief of police where they were not able to say what kind of weapon margaret brennan right beto o rourke was used but i also just watched a video on twitter of a family that is pinned to the ground the the children are crying they re all mexican american in a part of our country where mexican americans were targeted and hunted for their very ethnicity people are living with fear feel like they have targets on their backs right now kids are afraid to go to school tomorrow morning this is not right unacceptable and i won t accept it margaret brennan i want to ask you as well though about the other gathering storm the category 5 hurricane that s headed towards the united states when you look at the kind of federal preparedness we have now is there something as president you would change about it or do you think the system is ready to go beto o rourke i m really disappointed that president trump has proposed taking money from fema in the middle of hurricane season for walls or cages or militarization of the border that we do not need as president i would fully fund fema i would invest in the resiliency of communities in florida and georgia the carolinas and puerto rico to make sure that they re ready for the next storm because the scientists have told us these storms are only going to become more frequent margaret brennan mm beto o rourke more devastating and more deadly as the climate continues to change so the immediate priority is helping those in the path of these storms but the longer term goal is to confront climate change before it s too late free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and fully embrace renewable energy and get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions as soon as humanly possible no later than the year 2050 we we ve got to do all of that if we re going to meet this challenge margaret brennan you rolled out your trade policy this week new tariffs on china go into place today is there a situation where president o rourke would ever use tariffs beto o rourke as a last resort these tariffs are punishing farmers across this country destroying markets they ve worked their entire lives maybe their parents lives as well to open up now lost to them and to their children we see a tax on the american consumer that averages about nine hundred dollars a household and we are hurtling the world and this economy into recession so end these trade wars no more tariffs and then work in concert with our allies and our friends canada mexico the european union a united front against china and any of their trade practices that are manipulative or damaging to the united states margaret brennan does that mean something like the trans pacific partnership this beto o rourke no margaret brennan trade deal you wouldn t re enter that beto o rourke no i i wouldn t i would make sure margaret brennan but you re viewed as more friendly to free trade than some of your competitors beto o rourke i i want to make sure that trade works for us and it works for our farmers and it works for our workers i want to make sure that our trade deals are used to achieve our goals i ll give you some examples i mentioned climate change earlier this could be the platform for us to get the necessary concessions from trading partners to ensure that we don t warm this planet another degree and a half celsius trade deals could be the platform by which we ensure the dignity of working women and men all over the world make sure they re paid a fair wage and have working conditions that are safe for them and it s also a way to make sure that we protect the human rights of our fellow human beings all over the planet these are our values in this country let s use our trade deals to achieve them and make sure that we never do that at the expense of the american worker or the american farmer or the american economy margaret brennan beto o rourke good to have you here beto o rourke thank you margaret brennan thank you we ll be back in a moment announcements margaret brennan coming up next sunday on face the nation former defense secretary james mattis will be here to talk about his new book call sign chaos as well as america s role in the world today that s next week on face the nation announcements margaret brennan some of our stations are leaving us now but we will be right back with a lot more face the nation next up former fema administrator brock long we ll talk to him about hurricane preparation and recovery efforts and what can we do better when it comes to dealing with natural disasters plus our political panel and a reporter s notebook from syria just ahead on face the nation announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we want to speak now to fema administrator brock long he left the trump administration in march and now he is back in his home state of north carolina he joins us from charlotte this morning brock good to have you on the program brock long former fema administrator executive chairman of hagerty consulting good to be with you margaret brennan now we are learning that this is not just a category 5 hurricane but it s one of the largest hurricanes ever and particularly for that northwest part of the bahamas the strongest hurricane that place has ever seen how should fema be focused right now brock long well unfortunately there are a few things that scare me not only the wind intensity of this storm but what i really like to pay attention to is the forward speed of the storm and if you notice in this forecast it s it s actually forecast to stall and slow down even further and when that happens i know that the model guidance really doesn t handle storms that well and the track could change tremendously over the next twenty four to forty eight hours so fema s trying to get the word out to anybody from florida to north carolina one please don t let your guard down because even if the the center of circulation travels that left hand side of the air cone it could bring tremendous hit two to florida and other states as it passes up through the southeast but what fema focuses on is trying to properly stage incident management teams logistical support you know when it comes to supplies food commodities to backup state efforts and they always want to push as close to the storm as they can without putting people in harm s way margaret brennan mm hm you heard from the homeland security secretary that they do not project this storm to be making landfall in the u s right now but what you re saying is you don t think it is that certain brock long i i know that here again when you go back to the forward speed there s a lot of uncertainty in this margaret brennan yeah brock long in the track forecast and when a storm basically comes to a halt until it starts to move again the model guidance doesn t typically pick it up but looking at the model guidance it is in good agreement that the that that storm is going to turn back to the sort southeast but we we ve got to continue to watch it over the next twenty four to forty eight hours no doubt about it margaret brennan now in terms of disaster preparedness and response fema doesn t have a permanent leader hasn t since you left the job the homeland security secretary is also in an acting position does this lack of permanence affect the ability of the agencies to act brock long it s never ideal to not have a confirmed administrator in the position at fema but you know i brought jeff bard as well as pete gaynor in and knowing that those two guys are back there working with you know in control of fema i have great confidence they re two of the best emergency managers i ve ever met and they re actually backed up by twenty thousand of the most battle hardened fema staff that s ever existed i mean these guys have been through it over the last two years they ve been responding to storms and events from across half the globe margaret brennan mm hm brock long you know a lot of americans don t realize that they responded to the northern marianas when they were hit with the strongest storm in history and hurricane yutu and they ve responded all the way to the virgin islands and the east coast when we were in office or when i was in office i had over two hundred and twenty different events basically a new event every three or four days and these guys have been truly dedicated they bust their rear ends to serve other people and i sleep peacefully knowing that pete s there jeff s there and the experienced fema staff is in place margaret brennan you re you re praising the leadership but you have been critical of the agency s functions recently you said that it s dying a death of a thousand cuts it s understaffed you think it could be more efficient are you brock long yeah i do margaret brennan concerned the agency isn t isn t adequate to the challenges brock long well i think fema faces unrealistic expectations by congress and the american public and the standards in which we declare major disaster declarations need to be increased you know if you look at fifty percent of the disasters that fema has historically declared they are less than seven and a half million dollars and in some cases you know we ve got to stop looking at fema as 911 this is a partnership you know if we want to get better and become more resilient and and respond better then we have to refocus the training upon how we ask citizens to be prepared not just going out and having supplies for five to seven days but be you know teaching them how to become more financially resilient teaching them that insurance is the first line of defense not fema teaching them tangible skills like cpr when they face active shooter events but we also have to bolster state state and local capabilities but more importantly until congress starts to incentivize putting building codes in place and land use planning in place incentivizing states and locals for ensuring their public infrastructure fema s job is impossible so it wasn t a knock on fema it s just we have to set realistic expectations for the agency and really bolster the capability from neighbor helping neighbor all the way to the federal emergency management agency margaret brennan you were administrator when hurricane maria devastated puerto puerto rico which you know the trump administration was harshly criticized for the solutions you just laid out is that what you ve learned brock long well the problem what made puerto rico really difficult is because a lot of the infrastructure rotted and decayed over a period you know a long period of time no doubt about it and if americans may not remember but i had to ask for special authority to actually put funding forward on behalf of fema to fix puerto rico because of that fema doesn t have the authority to fix infrastructure that s not well maintained margaret brennan mm hm brock long and so when when when infrastructure is not maintained the impacts of a hurricane are going to be exponentially worse than what they should be so you know putting puerto rico and that issue aside going forward here again we ve got to start electing officials based on building codes and land use planning and those who advocate that and building incentives you know start providing more funding to the communities that implement you know it s and implement and uphold stronger building codes because they work margaret brennan i know that you fought for funding for puerto rico i think it s now forty two billion dollars that congress has approved to help puerto rico rebuild and not all of it s been dispersed but the president tweeted this week that puerto rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth and said it s really a matter of broken politicians corruption and that the money is being sent to crooked politicians what do you make of the president s comments given that you fought so hard for these this funding brock long well you know i i i think where where the president i m not going to speak for the president of the united states but you know having worked with puerto rico and we ve seen recently that the leadership of the commonwealth has collapsed you know if if american taxpayers are going to put you know billions and billions of dollars into rebuilding not only puerto rico but other jurisdictions then you know congress really needs to focus on making sure that once that infrastructure is rebuilt that it s maintained for years to come and i think that s the greatest concern that congress needs to be focused on and here again you know hurricane maria was far greater of an issue than just fema s response margaret brennan mm hm brock long and quite frankly a lot of people inside fema including myself believe that we kept puerto rico from complete and total collapse margaret brennan all right brock long thank you for sharing your insights with us and we will continue to be covering the storm we will be right back announcements margaret brennan it s time now for some analysis from our political panel shane harris covers intelligence and national security for the washington post salena zito is a column fist for the washington examiner david nakamura covers the white house also for the washington post and sahil kapur is a political reporter for bloomberg news shane sahil wel welcome to the broadcast good to have both of you back at the table as well salena zito washington examiner salenazito thank you margaret brennan david i want to start off with this storm the trump administration obviously faced a lot of criticism for how it handled hurricane maria is this all hands on deck focus response to that david nakamura washington post davidnakamura it seems to be all hands on deck you had a good interview with kevin mcaleenan at dhs right there at headquarters we don t know though if the president of the united states is as focused as he claims that he is he canceled a trip to poland to stay home and monitor the storm he sent mike pence instead pence just give a speech today but the president yesterday left camp david where he was apparently monitoring the storm to play a round of golf at his local club and he s been tweeting this morning about various topics yes about the hurricanes we don t know about other things the president has has politicized rec hurricane recovery very pointedly about puerto rico we know margaret brennan mm hm david nakamura and so the question of how how much he is focused on this remains an open question margaret brennan so puerto rico seems to not be in the direct line of this particular storm but two years after hurricane maria puerto rico continues to be brought up as a political issue particularly by the 2020 candidates why is that what is the motivation behind it sahil kapur bloomberg news sahilkapur it seems like the president s tone has changed on the hurricane as the path of the hurricane has changed it was first irritation it was kind of like we re going to have to do another rescue package from puerto rico and he s obviously headed back and forth there now the path of the hurricane has changed toward florida georgia the carolinas and he has taken on a much more somber tone he is tweeting out alerts by fema he is asking everyone to be careful and to be prepared some of this goes back to the fact that the president gets irritated by parts of the country that don t like him and he praises frequently parts of the country that do like him margaret brennan but the candidates themselves so many of these democratic candidates have made puerto rico even a campaign stop for themselves sahil kapur right and and that i think you will see that continue there is a constituency there that they are trying to speak to aid for puerto rico after the hurricane has been an issue that some candidates particularly julian castro who is trying to become the first latino president has talked about a lot and i think we ll see more of that going forward margaret brennan salena i know you are always you have your ear to the ground salena zito yeah margaret brennan on this road trip you just did six thousand miles across the country salena zito yeah margaret brennan when you see these sort of action oriented moments for the president does this end up being a political asset for him i mean are people as focused on this storm as all of us in the news business are salena zito well i think the people are focused on the well being of their fellow countrymen i mean i think that s the thing that people think about the most there s a level of expectation in particular with people who did vote for trump they didn t always particularly care for his comportment so and and sometimes the way he handles things they are like please but they do they are obviously concerned about people you know where they live what s going to happen how it s going to impact them not just on the coast but there is going to be major flooding that hits the interior of the country because of this meaning places like tennessee or alabama or all the way up into pennsylvania and west virginia so there s going to be a broader impact i think and and so people are paying attention to that i think there s a level of expectation that trump is always going to behave the way he does on twitter sometimes it makes them feel comfortable and happy and like go get it sometimes they are like come on margaret brennan shane we just did see from the president that he acknowledged the shooting in texas that happened yesterday we don t still know much about the motive what happened what why this shooting happened but are we going to re launch this conversation on a national security basis on a homeland security basis about gun legislation in a few weeks shane harris washington post shaneharris certainly if there is find if we find there s any kind of motive that s connected to domestic terrorism as there was in the el paso case yes i think you would see that debate kind of get reignited again i mean here we are sort of bookending the month of august with an attack at the beginning and another at the end and it s another reminder at a time when it seemed like the wind had kind of gone out of the sails of that debate a bit when the president was deferring to congress but within the national security community and the homeland security world there is kind of i won t say a renewed focus on gun violence as a possible outgrowth of domestic violence terrorism but people are starting to make those linkages that i think a lot of people on the operational level have been aware of for quite some time so if you find that kind of linkage again with the shooting in texas then i would suspect yes it will be another palpable example margaret brennan salena beto o rourke on the program argued that even in the state of texas there is a shift in sentiment an openness he argues to gun control reform is that something you heard on your road trip salena zito there there definitely is there is a sentiment about needing to do something and i think people really struggle with understanding what that something is i think that they believe in in conversations that i ve had it does has have to do with a different measure a different sort of barrier to gun purchases by or a background ground check but it also the people also they re really frustrated with how washington handles it they don t believe they you know everyone sort of is yelling at each other and in the middle is this problem whether it s guns or whether it s mental illness or maybe it s a combination of all of a a bunch of different things but people are really frustrated by just being unable to have this conversation david nakamura but the polls show that in fact the majorities of both parties support stronger legislation including background checks the president though even though he s hinted at different times including earlier this month and last year during the the parkland shootings in florida that he was maybe open to just some sort of stronger much stronger background checks but he s been lobbied heavily by the nra as they do each time to pose any kind of new gun laws or restrictions and the president has seemed to backtrack once again simply because he seems to really be appealing to his strongest supporters and and he s been warned specifically by the nra that there would be a backlash to anything like this so as much as there could be talk about stronger gun laws again in congress it s very unlikely that anything is going to is going to change salena zito that s true sahil kapur there ll be growing pressure on on congress to act and one of the reasons that 90 10 issues like background checks can t seem to get through is that there is a fear among republican leaders that those kinds of attempts will be portrayed in parts of the country and by activists groups like the nra as an as an existential threat to the second amendment it s not about the specific issue it s this mentality that vast swaths of the country have that any attempt at gun control no matter how popular no matter how modest is a step to ultimately taking away their guns and we ve seen a massive shift in the politics of guns something like thirty points in the direction of stricter gun control since the obama era as mass shootings become more and more routine even banning semi automatic assault weapons military style is now a two to one popular issue in the united states which we hadn t seen before still prospects for action are dubious right now margaret brennan shane speaking of existential threats we heard from james mattis for the very first time since he resigned from the trump administration he wrote in a wall street journal essay this week that what concerns him right now about the country are not our external adversaries it s our internal divisiveness we all know we re better than our current politics he wrote tribalism must not be allowed to destroy our experiment i read that not as an indictment of the administration but as an indictment of the american people right now and where we are as a country shane harris yeah and the political system and sort of a wake up call to them and trying to summon them to some kind of place where we can as you said you know we re not shouting at each other and really pointing out that there is a real risk to this this sort of the secure fabric of the country and to the fragile democracy that we have from this kind of tribalism you had to read between the lines a lot margaret brennan mm hm shane harris on his comments about trump you did not on this one and he also talked about fraying international alliances the reason that he resigned of course he s talked about that was because he felt that we were backing away from those alliances and also the pullout of syria this was remarkable to hear somebody who has spent his career focused on the foreign threats and on protecting the country from external adversaries now turning inward and saying this is actually the thing that could take us down margaret brennan and in his first television interview with our c cbs david martin he laid out criticisms of the bush bush administration in the iraq war though he was careful on how he worded it criticism of the obama administration not perceiving the threat in the same way from iran he told david and in the trump administration the only criticism we heard so far is what shane highlighted not valuing alliances the way he thought was proper there seemed this expectation or disappointment among some particularly democrats that he didn t come out swinging david nakamura i think you see margaret brennan at the commander in chief david nakamura i think you see democrats holding their hopes for you know robert mueller and james mattis of of sort of coming out and very forcefully advocating for a position against the president and his policies by resigning he made clear that he doesn t support what the president was trying to do in places in the world including afghanistan but more broadly i think for demo he made it clear that as a military man he s not interested in in impugning sort of a sitting president in that way and as shane said you had to read between the lines in what he was saying i think though this is a time where where opponents of the president think you got to take a much clearer stand and that someone like mattis has that that gravitas to sort of break through beyond the partnership to deliver that message but once he does so he becomes part of the partnership that he s decrying salena zito mattis was i think he really nailed it in terms of understanding what s going on in the country i ve i ve often said trump is he s not the cause of of his presidency he s the result of people not liking what happened under bush or what happened under obama so they decided to go with sort of this thing this difference and i think that is a a reflection of that sahil kapur yeah the question is whether you know mattis has something to say and whether he s potentially holding back the values he fought for as a commander for all those years are for private citizens which he is now to speak about you know to speak their thoughts about their government and to be critical he wants to so i think that s where people are if you have something to say about the president shane harris yeah sahil kapur say it in fifteen months the country is going to decide whether to give him another four years margaret brennan someone who did james comey he did say what he thought of the president and you had him on twitter sort of saying he was vindicated by this inspector general report which did not recommend any kind of prosecution and said he didn t reveal classified info what do we actually need to know about it sahil kapur well it it seems like this issue is so entrenched public opinion is so calcified on the question of james comey the russia investigation everything leading up to it the president has galvanized his supporters to doubt this entire narrative and to believe that there is a conspiracy against him jim comey tweeted out that there was no you know vindication of of his own kind of of his own sort that he didn t quite do anything wrong in terms of releasing classified information to the press so i think everyone s in their corners on this issue i don t think public opinion changes shane harris it s also i mean comey s holding himself out to somebody who is he s not denying that he actually broke internal fbi rules which is what the ig report found even though indistinct real classified information but he s essentially holding him out as someone should i saw something wrong that was happening and i decided to do something about it now the ig report excoriated him for that essentially saying that he decided he was the one who could break the rules it it really sort of implicitly cast him as this kind of self righteous figure which a lot of jim comey s critics have said margaret brennan hm shane harris he is very much the opposite of jim mattis he s been willingly casting himself as the voice of kind of sane government that s attacking the president and it has pushed people further into their camps margaret brennan right shane harris jim comey s not convincing anyone that wasn t already with him margaret brennan right well we have to david nakamura you see trump trump okay margaret brennan david sorry i have to leave it there because we have a very important report from syria we have to get to in just a moment announcements margaret brennan on saturday u s forces
