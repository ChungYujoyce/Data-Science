in a nearly 30 minute interview on cnn s new day ben carson repeatedly lashed out atrecent inquiriesintohis violent childhood as pathetic and attacked hostalisyn camerota friday morning for pushing what he called a smear campaign on thursday cnn revealed that it was unable to corroborate any of carson s past accounts including claims he once punched a classmate and stabbed another according to cnn at least nine of carson s childhood classmates had no recollection of events as described by carson when camerota asked carson about cnn s report a frustrated carson raised his voice from a whisper to a more forceful inside voice this is a bunch of lies attempting to say i m lying about my history i think it s pathetic and basically what the media does is they try to get you distracted carson pushed back it is just garbage carson told camerota we have too many things that are important to deal with undeterred camerota asked carson about specific discrepancies namely why the cnn reporters who traveled to detroit were unable to identify any of his past victims dr carson your story has changed camerota pointed out asking carson why he changed the name and relation of the young man he claimed to have stabbed as an adolescent the names i used for instance are fictitious names because i don t want to bring people into something like this because i know what you guys do to their lives carson told camerota insisting that the young man he stabbed does indeed exist i talked to him he would prefer to stay out of the media and i want to respect that carson explained that s not the real name but yes he s a very real person i talked to him yesterday carson said he was a family member and you know i really don t want to expose him further the story is well documented carson continued if you choose not to believe it if it doesn t fit the narrative that you want that s fine let s let the american people decide but when camerota insisted that cnn had simply participated in a longstanding journalistic practice of vetting presidential candidates carson rehashed the tried and true complaint against a biased media give me a break are you kidding carson said laughing the vetting that you all did with president obama doesn t even come close doesn t even come close to what you guys are trying to do in my case and you re just going to keep going back he said this 12 years ago it is just garbage carson said i want you to ask hillary clinton the same questions you ask me carson challenged camerota insisting the network press the former secretary of state about benghazi will you do that promise you re going to do that we re waiting pushing him on his complaints of a mainstream media bias camerota asked carson about a new mother jones report highlighting a 2014 speech during which the retired neurosurgeon said that we d be cuba if there were no fox news and joking that some americans are stupid camerota attempted to no avail to get carson to clarify which americans he was describing as stupid so just to be clear people who support food stamps or medicaid or welfare camerota asked i didn t say that now you re trying to put words into my mouth carson cut in why don t you listen to what i just told you it sounds like what you re saying are liberals she pressed on you mean that if fox news didn t exist we would be a communist country no again there you go with sensationalism carson said angrily that s what you try to do you hope somehow that will resonate with people who don t think for themselves i ve got news for you people are a lot smarter than you think they are and they know exactly what i m talking about dr carson you said it camerota said in her defense dr carson i m quoting i m not even quoting you i m playing your words you are the person who said there are a lot of people who are stupid and without fox news we would be cuba i can t believe that you used to work on fox news carsonshot back in exasperation are
