the news media has the worst approval rating of all major american institutions grappling with the novel coronavirus but the public s opinions on the matter are highly polarized and mirror their complex feelings from before the pandemic a gallup survey released this week found 44 percent of americans approve of the news media s handling of the coronavirus crisis it found 61 percent of democrats and democratic leaning voters approve of the media compared to 25 percent of republicans hospitals schools and state governments had the highest marks president trump s approval rating on this crisis stands at 60 percent compared to his overall job rating of 49 percent for decades the public s trust in news media has split along the political spectrum the election of trump who has dubbed journalists the enemy of the people saw republican trust in media drop to a historic low and democratic confidence in media spike that has since evened out and in september 2019 gallup found 25 percent of republicans trusted the media compared to 69 percent of democrats but the bad marks for news media seem partially due to how these questions are phrased it s very difficult to know what people have in mind when they are asked about the news media today said tom rosenstiel executive director of the american press institute it could mean what s in their twitter or social media feed or it could be a thing that they see that annoys them on television he said the average person is a not a press critic so we really don t know what they re reacting to we do know that when we ask them about the news media they use in most polls they re more approving sign up for our coronavirus updates newsletter to track the outbreak all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access dear readers please stop calling us the media there is no such thing indeed people give much higher marks when asked about the news media you use most often vs the news media a much more abstract term a 2017 survey from the media insight project found 24 percent of americans believed the news media is moral a figure that doubled when they were asked about the news media they often use and trust in news media isn t just a partisan division the september 2019 gallup survey also found that adults younger than 35 had the least trust in news media among all age groups media approval spiked slightly in the wake of the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks but that was a singular event with dramatic images that people could find only via news media network news ran round the clock after the 2001 terrorist attacks why not for coronavirus the coronavirus pandemic on the other hand is an invisible menace that s also altering the lives of many more people it s also a scientific story it would be better at a moment like this if we were getting largely accurate vetted factual data and that as a country we all agreed on what those facts were rosenstiel said if some of the population is operating off a different set of facts and thinks it s okay to behave in a certain way that could literally infect the other part of the population local journalism needs a coronavirus stimulus plan too but while people may not like what they see on tv or read online from news outlets that doesn t mean they are dismissing it altogether he added you can be skeptical of the press and still rely on it he said you can be disapproving of things you see in the media and still rely on it the latest gallup findings come from 1 020 adults who were surveyed last week with the findings having a margin of error of 4 percentage points live updates the latest in the u s coronavirus maps cases and deaths in the u s cases and deaths worldwide which states are reopening what you need to know your life at home personal finance guide make your own fabric mask follow all of our coronavirus coverage and sign up for our daily newsletter how to help your community seniors restaurants keep at risk people in mind have you been hospitalized for covid 19 tell us whether you ve gotten a bill receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
