on wednesday republican presidential nominee donald trump delivered a planned speech on his democratic opponent hillary clinton and according toslatecolumnist and clinton supporter michelle goldberg itwas probably the most unnervingly effective one he has ever given in which he skillfully combined truth and falsehood into a plausible seeming picture meant to reinforce listeners underlying beliefs though packed with fabrications as usual the republican presidential nominee avoided blatant and obvious lies bizarre conspiracy theories although he did claim that foreign governments may have a blackmail file on clinton while discussing the email scandal which is entering alex jones territory and personal insults all of which he had previously employed in his attacks on clinton again the speech wasextremely dishonest in many parts but the falsehoodswere more subtle and less downright loony and thus much more effective over the past couple of weeks trumphas done a lot to sabotage his own campaign from his racist attacks on the hispanic judge overseeing the class action lawsuit against trump universityto his shameless tweet congratulating himself after the orlando mass shooting this has led some toconcludethat the billionairedoesn t really want to be president and really who can blame him and is deliberately running his campaign into a wall since becoming the nominee almost two months ago his already atrocious favorability ratings have continued to drop and according to abloomberg surveyfrom last week 66 percent of americans now view him unfavorably there is no doubt that the election is clinton s to lose the former secretary of state s campaign is a well oiled machine that currently has aboutfortytimes as much cash on hand as the trump campaign and while clinton is overwhelmingly distrusted and disliked by the public the idea of a donald trump presidency tends to scare more than half of americans and he has done a great job at repelling women and people of color over the past year however if trump can refrain from attacking bill clinton s infidelities and accusing the couple of plotting the murder of a friend and colleague vince foster and instead makesubstantive criticisms and there are plenty of substantive criticisms to be made he could potentiallymake clinton s life much more difficultin the months ahead of course it is unlikely that trump will actually do this he has proven time and again that he has a natural aversion towards substantive debate and prefers touting conspiracy theories and making personal attacks he is an impulsive bully whose propensity for pettiness knows no bounds but the sheer political baggage of clinton does make her very vulnerable indeed from her ties to big wall street firms like goldman sachs whether incampaign contributionsorpaid speeches to the clinton foundation s financial connectionstoforeign governmentslike saudi arabia along with ugly and inconvenient truths like the fact that clinton s state departmentapproved massive arms dealswith the aforementioned country after it had donated millions to her and bill s non profit or the fact that bill earned thehighest paid speechesof his post presidency careerwhile his wife was secretary of state most of which weresponsoredby foreign governments and foreign organizations if trump sticks to these kinds of facts in his criticisms of clinton without straying into alex jones or donald trump the mindless bully territory hillary s path to the white house could become increasingly complicated it does make you wonder after being dogged by scandals and conspiracy theories ever since they entered the national spotlight did hillary and bill think that giving high priced speeches forpubliclydespisedcompanies like goldman sachs and general electric accepting millions of dollars from foreign governments and organizations for their foundation or cozying up with shady donors like sant chatwal and frank giustra all of these companies individuals and governments are interested in buying influence and to say otherwise is delusional would be ignored by their opponents as i havepreviously noted it takes a special kind of arrogance to think this way although it s possible that hillary expected her republican opponent to be even more tainted by big donors being a republican and all of course donald trump is an entirely different kind of corrupt he hasn t been inpolitics his entire life and doesn t have a history of accepting big donations from wall street and corporate america instead the billionaire is simply a charlatan and a fraud whether it s swindling vulnerable working people into buying sham trump university degrees or fear mongering bullying and flagrantlylying his way to the nomination trump is the lovechild of p t barnum and george wallace a shameless self promoter with an ego that makes kanye west look humble and a temperamentthat makes joe mccarthy seem refined and these qualities will probably get the better of him in the months ahead the buffoonish billionaire will most likelycontinue rambling incoherentlyabout conspiracy theories that he s read on infowars com and mocking bubba s infidelities and for this clinton should be grateful conor lynch is a writer and journalist living in new york city his work has appeared on salon alternet counterpunch and opendemocracy follow him on twitter
