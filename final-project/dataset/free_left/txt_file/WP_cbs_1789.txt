wednesday that admin officials confirm wsj story request was made to make sure mccain ship wasn t visible aides say trump wasn t involved in request but it was made to prevent any potential ire from potus the journal reported that when a navy commander expressed surprise at the instruction the u s indo pacific command official answered first i heard of it as well the official said he would talk to the white house military office to get more information about the directive the journal said in response to the story mr trump who feuded with mccain publicly for years and at one point mocked his military service tweeted that he was not informed about anything having to do with the navy ship uss john s mccain during my recent visit to japan the president notably does not say that he was not informed about the ship before his visit a message seeking clarification was left late wednesday for white house press secretary sarah sanders the president again denied the reports on thursday telling reporters at the white house firmly that he was not involved in the decision making process i would not have done that i was not a big fan of john mccain in any way shape or form to me john mccain i wasn t a fan but i would never do a thing like that now someone did it because they thought i didn t like him they were well meaning i will say but i wouldn t have mr trump said in jakarta indonesia on thursday morning acting u s defense secretary patrick shanahan told reporters when i read about it this morning it was the first i heard about it he later told reporters traveling with him to a security conference in singapore that he would ask his chief of staff to look into the reports i never authorized i never approved any action around the movement or activities regarding that ship shanahan said he said he would never dishonor the memory of a great american like mccain or disrespect the young men and women in the crew of the ship asked about service members getting involved in political situations shanahan said the military needs to do their job and stay out of politics the journal reported that a tarp was placed over the uss john s mccain s name before mr trump s arrival according to photos it reviewed and that sailors were instructed to remove any coverings from the ship that included its name the navy s chief of information rear admiral charlie brown tweeted wednesday night that the name of uss john s mccain was not obscured during the potus visit to yokosuka on memorial day the navy is proud of that ship its crew its namesake and its heritage a pacific fleet spokesperson confirmed to cbs news that the picture of the tarp is from friday and it was taken down on saturday all ships remained in normal configuration during the president s visit martin says the mccain s commanding officer was on the ship on saturday and the tarp was gone the admiral in command of the 7th fleet adm bill sawyer is credited with directing that nothing would be covered up martin adds two u s officials told the ap that all the ships in the harbor were lined up for mr trump s visit and they were visible from the uss wasp the officials said however that most of their names probably could not be seen since they were side by side but that the name of the uss john s mccain could be seen from the pier asked if the tarp was meant to block mr trump s view of the ship the officials said the tarp had been placed on the ship for maintenance and removed for the visit two u s officials said a paint barge was in front of the uss john s mccain on saturday morning when 7th fleet officials walked the pier to see how everything looked for the visit the barge was then ordered to be moved and was gone by the time mr trump arrived the officials said the journal reported based on people familiar with the matter that sailors on the uss john s mccain who usually wear hats with the ship s name on it were given the day off when mr trump visited sailors from mccain were given the day off martin reported he said there was no reason to disbelieve the sailors who say they were wearing mccain ballcaps and were turned away but it is possible the reason they were turned away is that ball caps were not part of the dress code for the event two u s officials told the ap that sailors on the ship were not told to stay away but that many were away for the long weekend the officials also said that about 800 sailors from more than 20 ships and navy commands were on the uss wasp during the president s visit and all wore the same navy hat that has no logo rather than wearing individual ship or command hats mr trump and mccain had a frosty relationship and that continued on mr trump s part even after mccain died in august 2018 of brain cancer in 2015 mccain a republican senator from arizona had gotten under then candidate mr trump s skin by saying he had fired up the crazies at a rally in phoenix mr trump also a republican later told a crowd in iowa that mccain was only a war hero because he was captured i like people who weren t captured after mr trump took office mccain established himself as a leading critic opposing mr trump s immigration limiting order warning him against coziness with moscow and lecturing him on the illegality of torture the senator incensed the president with his thumbs down vote that foiled the president s efforts to repeal president barack obama s health care law mr trump was not welcome at mccain s funeral and raised the white house s u s flag back to full staff shortly after mccain s death despite u s flag code stating that it should remain at half staff for another day the flag returned to half staff later in the day mccain s daughter meghan tweeted wednesday that mr trump will always be deeply threatened by the greatness of my dads incredible life she added there is a lot of criticism of how much i speak about my dad but nine months since he passed mr trump won t let him rip so i have to stand up for him it makes my grief unbearable she later addressed the controversy on air on abc s the view on thursday saying the president s actions have consequences when you repeatedly are attacking my father and war heroes it creates a culture in the military where people are clearly fearful to show my father s name mccain said that s what started this again if you re afraid to have a hat or show the name of the warship which is named after my grandfather who was an officer in the navy the uss john s mccain is named for the late senator and his father and grandfather who were both navy admirals the destroyer was involved in a 2017 collision that took the lives of 10 crew members and the reuters news service reports is currently undergoing repairs first published on may 30 2019 6 44 am 2019 cbs
