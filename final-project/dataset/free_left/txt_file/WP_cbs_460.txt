scrappy team that is going to fight for every last vote and we think south carolina voters can see that said south carolina communications director paige hill from what we ve heard on the ground it means that voters know joe biden they know his character and his values and he has a long history with south carolina that includes not just campaigning but decades long relationships whether we are

thedes moines register considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations i know that i can t say that i was not a part of a product of that cbs news campaign reporter adam brewstersays 2020 presidential candidates quickly denounced king s comments including buttigieg who is campaigning in southeast iowa you would think it would be pretty easy to come out against rape and incest then again you would think it d be pretty easy to come out against white nationalism buttigieg said he went on to say that he believes the democrat running in the state s 4th congressional district j d scholten would be an excellent public servant other 2020 candidates including new jersey sen cory booker and new york sen kirsten gillibrand called on king to resign booker washington gov jay inslee former texas rep beto o rourke and former maryland rep john delaney posted on twitter to encourage supporters to donate to scholten yet again steve king puts his selfish hateful ideology above the needs of the people of iowa s 4th district excusing violence in any way is entirely unacceptable scholten said in a statement responding to king his comments are disrespectful to survivors and don t reflect iowan values we stand for bringing all people together and fighting for the positive change that we desperately need here in iowa republican state sen randy feenstra who is challenging king in the primary posted ontwitter i am 100 pro life but steve king s bizarre comments and behavior diminish our message damage our cause trump needs defenders in congress not distractions i will ensure we win this seat i ll be an effective conservative leader in congress king s comments also drew criticism from his colleagues on capitol hill these comments are wrong and offensive and underscore why we removed him from his committees said louisiana rep steve scalise the number two ranking house republican earlier today democratic candidate kamala harris weighed in on twitter concerningreportsthat south carolina gop lawmakers are fast tracking an abortion ban through a state senate subcommittee before the state s general assembly meets in january it s outrageous south carolina republicans are covertly fast tracking a dangerous bill to ban abortions before most women even know they re pregnant said harris in atweet this is why i ll require states with a history of violating roe v wade to pre clear any abortion law before it takes effect the hearing whichcbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchellsays is scheduled to take place before the state senate s medical affairs subcommittee on sept 10 would feature hours of testimony concerning a measure that would ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected earlier this year the south carolina

performed in the state in 2018 holly gatling the executive director of south carolina citizens for life says the non profit is pleased that state senators are holding the scheduled hearings and hopes that the lawmakers will uphold the work of the state house it s about restoring legal protection to the unborn and expanding protection to the medically vulnerable members of our human family said gatling we live in a disposable society where they throw everything away and the weakest members of our society the unborn and the medically vulnerable are the most targeted groups on the other side of this fight planned parenthood maintains that states with more abortion restrictions tend to have poorer health outcomes for women and children vicki ringer the south carolina public affairs director for planned parenthood votes south atlantic said in a statement that this latest effort by south carolina politicians is an egregious attempt to ban abortion in the state and that the bill could take away a woman s right to make a medical choice before knowing she has a decision to make calling a special session to specifically ban abortion in our state just demonstrates how extreme and out of touch the lawmakers pushing this ban are never before have politicians in sc called for a committee meeting outside of legislative session just to attack abortion rights said ringer abortion is a critical component not only of women s health care but of their ability to lead free and fulfilling lives with dignity and autonomy when asked whether the topic of abortion should continue to be at the forefront of the 2020 presidential campaign gatling added that this conversation is the single most important issue in our country today without the right to life there are no other rights
