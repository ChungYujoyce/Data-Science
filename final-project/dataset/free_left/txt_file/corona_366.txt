advertisement supported by governors face intensifying pressure to reopen their economies but experts warn it could mean thousands of new deaths by sarah mervosh and amy harmon in connecticut flags that had been lowered during the somber peak of the coronavirus pandemic were raised to full staff on wednesday to signal a return to business in kentucky gift shops creaked open their doors and across alaska restaurants bars and gyms which have been open to small numbers of customers for weeks were getting ready to rev back up to full capacity it will all be open gov mike dunleavy announced just like it was prior to the virus the united states has crossed an uneasy threshold with all 50 states beginning to reopen in some way two months after the coronavirus thrust the country into lockdown but there are vast variations in how states are deciding to open up with some forging far ahead of others the increasing moves to lift restrictions on businesses or at least open up outdoor spaces like beaches and state parks reflect the immense political and societal pressures weighing on the nation s governors even as epidemiologists remain cautious and warn of a second wave of cases with millions of people out of work and many americans entering their third month isolated at home the push to take action rivals what states faced at the beginning of the crisis when governors were urged to shut down you have 50 different governors doing 50 different things said andrew noymer an associate professor of public health at the university of california irvine there will be states that open too soon or states that are too conservative it is hard to thread the needle but if reopening has become a buzz word among politicians many states have issued sweeping documents with color coded plans to rebound and bounce back life remains far from normal in most places across america even in georgia which opened many businesses last month ahead of other states restaurants are seeing only about 15 percent of normal traffic according to data published by opentable a restaurant reservation website the white house has said that states should have a downward trajectory of cases over a 14 day period before reopening but many states reopened well short of meeting those benchmarks some epidemiologists see warning signs of a rebound especially in the south and because it can take as long as three weeks for a newly infected person to become sick enough to go to the hospital the impact of reopening is unlikely to be detectable immediately we really are playing with fire here in a very broad sense said charles courtemanche an economist at the university of kentucky in a recent paper for the journal health affairs he estimated that the number of confirmed cases in the united states which reached a million at the end of april would have been closer to 35 million without the restaurant closures and stay at home orders that began in mid march just because it hasn t been a catastrophe yet in your state doesn t mean it doesn t have the potential to be he said ipakoi grigoriadis was left to navigate the complexities while fielding breakfast orders at her family s diner pop s family restaurant in milford conn which reopened to outdoor dining on wednesday as connecticut lifted its stay at home order and allowed some businesses to reopen it is still a little scary considering we don t exactly know what this is said ms grigoriadis who said the restaurant was taking a number of precautions employees were instructed to wear masks and gloves at all times she said and patrons were expected to wear masks while at the restaurant as well except when they are eating and drinking connecticut was among the last states to take the plunge toward reopening representing the more cautious approach that has defined much of the northeast new york which has seen by far the most cases and deaths in the nation is proceeding with a regional reopening that excludes hard hit new york city in washington d c a stay at home order is in effect until june and the surrounding region remains closed several states on the west coast and certain democratic led states in the midwest have also moved slowly taking a regional or step by step approach by contrast a number of states in the south opened earlier and more fully businesses have been open with social distancing requirements for nearly a month in georgia where the number of new cases has remained more or less the same mississippi saw its largest single day increase in reported cases and deaths only after the state began to reopen the variation illustrates the political and regional differences that have come to define the state by state response to the coronavirus as governors navigate a pandemic that comes with no political playbook texas the nation s second largest state with 29 million residents had among the shortest stay at home orders in the country when it reopened many businesses on may 1 in a move that appealed to the state s pro business spirit but weeks later officials reported the highest one day total of new cases and some fear many businesses will still not survive of the more than 50 000 restaurants in texas 12 percent have gone out of business because of the pandemic said emily williams knight chief executive of the texas restaurant association she said she expected that up to 30 percent would not make it through the crisis the state s restaurant industry has already lost 700 000 jobs she said and would most likely lose more i think you see customers now having an emotional impact of driving up and having a restaurant they ve spent years at simply closed with a note saying thank you for your patronage over the years she said while scores of restaurants flounder

most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe

shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april

typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep

meals in major cities we really didn t know what to expect said rachel collier a spokeswoman for the museum which remains closed even as the gift shop opened back up she said the museum s revenue had declined by 95 percent during the pandemic which also forced the kentucky derby to be postponed for the first time in 75 years even without the boon of tourism she said a small but steady stream of customers drifted through the gift shop on wednesday many eager to buy cups engraved with this year s canceled derby date we are pleasantly surprised she said researchers expect that reopening the united states could cause thousands of additional deaths while also saving several million jobs a balancing act that has swung more toward the economy in recent weeks a forecast from the university of pennsylvania s penn wharton budget model estimated that the number of cumulative deaths from the virus in the united states would rise to 157 000 from the current about 92 000 by the end of july if states maintained restrictions a partial or full reopening could bring an additional 15 000 or 73 000 deaths respectively researchers found that the biggest risk for negative health outcomes was probably not state regulations but people s own behavior if americans get out of the habit of social distancing returning to their pre pandemic behavior by not wearing masks or staying six feet apart the forecast predicted that deaths could rise by as many as 135 000 everyone wants us to talk about policy but in fact personal behavior still matters a lot here said kent smetters the faculty director at the penn wharton budget model many are still hesitant a new poll by the associated press norc center for public affairs research found that most americans were somewhat concerned that lifting restrictions in their area would lead to new infections and at least half were very or extremely concerned about six in 10 people were in favor of people remaining in their homes except for
