advertisement supported by by alexander burns philadelphia democrats marked a decisive turn in their campaign against donald j trump this week moving to recast the 2016 race not as a conventional battle between left and right but as a national emergency that requires voters of all stripes to band together against a singularly menacing candidate abandoning their standard critique against conservative republicans allies of hillary clinton argued that mr trump was not merely another champion of right wing ideas deserving of rejection for his views on the environment or health care instead in an onslaught of astonishing ferocity led by president obama they used their convention to portray mr trump as a dangerously unstable figure and a friend of foreign despots like president vladimir v putin of russia some democrats suggested mr trump might have authoritarian impulses of his own prominent in mrs clinton s acceptance speech thursday night was a pointed reminder that the american system was designed to prevent the rise of a dictator in effect mrs clinton and democratic party leaders signaled that they would seek to fight the general election to some extent in nonpartisan terms as a clash between the broad mainstream of american voters and a candidate they argue would put the nation in jeopardy david boaz the executive vice president of the cato institute a libertarian think tank said democrats had picked up on an unsettling theme in mr trump s campaign he said the attacks this week on mr trump as an autocrat had the potential to resonate outside the democratic base a visual analysis of the presidential and vice presidential convention speeches i really don t think that s too over the top mr boaz said we have one candidate who s not even pretending he is promising to be a one man ruler mrs clinton herself stopped short of denouncing mr trump as an authoritarian but in her convention speech and on the campaign trail in recent days she described his political worldview as being in profound tension with traditional american values that somewhat gentler argument strategists close to mrs clinton said will be central to her campaign in the general election she has rebuked mr trump repeatedly for depicting the united states as a nation in decline and declaring i alone can fix it that sentiment mrs clinton said is inconsistent with democracy mrs clinton returned to that theme on thursday and said mr trump s proclamation should set off alarm bells for all of us remember she said our founders fought a revolution and wrote a constitution so america would never be a nation where one person had all the power mr trump and his campaign have batted away suggestions that he holds antidemocratic views paul manafort mr trump s campaign chairman said on thursday that the democrats new attempts to label mr trump a dictator in waiting signaled desperation and were an effort to counter his rousing convention speech last week in cleveland protesters reporters delegates and security personnel converged in philadelphia for the democratic national convention in that address mr trump offered himself to the country as a law and order candidate and a champion of working people in a nation under siege democrats mr manafort said were trying to attack mr trump to skirt responsibility for the conditions he is now campaigning against but the attacks democrats leveled in philadelphia may not be so easily dismissed vice president joseph r biden jr said mr trump was so unprepared and so divisive that he would put american lives at risk in an electric wednesday night speech mr obama lumped mr trump s candidacy with violent ideologies that have spawned attacks on america anyone who threatens our values whether fascists or communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues will always fail in the end mr obama said americans the president said do not look to be ruled democrats recruited respected figures from outside the party to amplify their appeal michael r bloomberg the billionaire former new york city mayor who is a political independent warned sternly that non democrats must rally with mrs clinton to stop a dangerous demagogue john allen a retired four star marine general thundered into an arena dotted with american flags that voters faced a choice between mrs clinton and a dark place of discord and fear there is no recent precedent in american politics for such unrelenting and direct attacks on a presidential nominee s commitment to the basic institutions of democracy alvin s felzenberg a historian and conservative columnist said the latest point of comparison for this week s democratic barrage might be the 1940 election in which republicans savaged franklin d roosevelt for defying tradition to pursue a third term as president even that mr felzenberg said was not with this tenacity and not at the conventions per se but mr trump has stirred concerns throughout the 2016 race on the left and right with a political approach and a set of policy prescriptions that plainly defy the norms of american politics he has campaigned on pledges to bar muslims from entering the united states and to torture people suspected of terrorism mr trump has recently suggested barring people from the united states based on their country of origin though he has not ruled out a religious test in philadelphia on thursday night khizr khan whose son a muslim and a united states army captain was killed fighting in iraq stirred the convention crowd as he denounced mr trump s proposal calling it an offense against the constitution donald trump you re asking americans to trust you with their future mr khan said let me ask you have you even read the united states constitution mr trump has routinely praised autocratic foreign leaders for what he characterizes as their steely leadership abilities he has hailed saddam hussein the executed iraqi leader for his skill at maintaining power and said of kim jong un the north korean leader you have to give him credit for consolidating authority this week amid reports that russian backed hackers had breached the democratic national committee mr trump said he considered mr putin a superior leader to mr obama mr trump also said on wednesday that he hoped russia would hack and release emails that mrs clinton deleted from her time as secretary of state he said later that the remark was intended as sarcasm mr manafort the trump campaign chairman indicated that mr trump would not back away from presenting himself as a rescuer for a nation in peril the reason donald trump s speech at the convention worked was because he was saying what people are feeling and thinking mr manafort said in an email mr trump s emphasis on national strength he said is meant to hammer home that weak leadership from mr obama and mrs clinton is what caused the instability in the world that exists today and trump aides have argued that his defiant claim i alone can fix it has been distorted by democrats mr trump they say aimed to present himself as the only available candidate who can turn the country around but democrats intend to keep up their wall to wall assault on mr trump s worldview and fitness for office clinton surrogates will crisscross the country with the message that he is a singular threat and a well funded super pac plans to beam the message into swing state living rooms jennifer palmieri the communications director for mrs clinton said the campaign would hammer the message that mr trump is not a normal republican he has an incredibly disturbing theory that at its core rejects the american values of both self reliance and the value of community ms palmieri said geoff garin a pollster for priorities usa action the main pro clinton super pac said the race had entered a new phase a defining goal for the group now he said was to ensure that voters reckon with what it would mean to have a dangerous demagogue like trump as president gov dannel p malloy of connecticut the chairman of the democratic governors association said mr trump s candidacy echoed the rise of fascism in europe before world war ii maybe this is an american version of that divide and conquer marginalize as many as you can mr malloy said just outside the conventional hall the republican presidential nominee mr malloy said should be cast as a uniquely bad force in american politics whether he has evil purposes in mind mr malloy said he is a dangerous man advertisement
