the day is long down ballot candidates walk a fine line raising cash during a pandemic as states institute stay at home orders advising residents to remain indoors it s a challenging time to run a campaign it s a particularly difficult time to ask voters and even supporters for cash to help fuel the operation in three weeks more than 16 million u s workers filed for unemployment benefits as efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus shut down businesses across the country with so many people hurting and unsure what the future holds candidates are faced with a conundrum how do you ask someone to give money to a campaign right now posed charleston county democratic party chair colleen condon i don t know how you do it i don t know how anybody does it it s a question that candidates and supporting organizations are grappling with all across the united states report cbs news political unit associate producers sarah ewall wice and eleanor watson cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchell and cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro many struggle with asking for cash even in the best of times but experts note for better or worse money is still what makes the rest of campaign efforts possible so it is now about striking a delicate balance on fundraising it s definitely a huge challenge especially for down ballot candidates who don t have as big of a network to work with said ianthe metzger deputy director of campaign communications for emily s list which works with progressive women candidates if we do get back to normal in a few months candidates are going to need the resources to get them over the finish line so we re not telling them to stop fundraising just to kind of really talk to people she adds elizabeth warren kamala harris senators elizabeth warren and kamala harris on friday introduced a bill that would federally ban price gouging of consumer goods during national emergencies such as the covid 19 pandemic cbs news campaign reporter zak hudaksays the bill is the senate companion to one introduced in the house wednesday that s modeled off a california law against rising the price of certain goods over 10 after a statewide emergency has been declared the federal bill would allow the ftc to enforce compliance with a ban on any price increases deemed excessive or opportunistic this bill would protect consumers now and during any future crisis by setting tougher rules of the road and enhancing enforcement against predatory price gouging and it needs to be included in congress s next relief package warren said in a statement voting rights the november presidential election is more than six months away but officials from both parties are already sounding the alarm about the need for more resources to ensure health safety and expand alternatives to in person and day of voting reportcbs news campaign reporters musadiq bidar adam brewster political unit associate producer sarah ewall wiceandcbsn political reporter caitlin huey burns and while some states are taking the lead in expanding vote by mail options a protracted partisan fight over what the general election could and should look like in the age of coronavirus is underway there are several challenges including the need for more resources to build the needed infrastructure as the clock continues to tick polling shows that voters are also thinking ahead about the impact the virus could have on elections a new reuters ipsos survey found 72 of all u s adults support requirements for mail in ballots as a way to protect voters should the virus continue to spread including 79 of democrats and 65 of republicans four states already conduct their general elections by mail and hawaii is set to become the fifth state to join this year another 28 states and washington d c offer no excuse absentee or mail voting but now democrats are pushing for it to be implemented nationwide the newly passed stimulus package allocated 400 million to help secure elections but democratic leaders in congress are pushing for additional funds the brennan center estimates that ensuring a vote by mail option in all states would cost at least 1 4 billion which would include ballot printing postage costs dropbox security ballot tracking and processing staffing and additional technology the center also estimates another 270 million would be necessary to ensure the safety of in person voting and expand early voting for republicans at the national level mr trump is leading the charge against expanded vote by mail people cheat mr trump said at his daily briefing on tuesday though he too voted absentee by mail in florida s primary last month the mail ballots are corrupt in my opinion they collect them go out and get people to sign them forgeries in many cases mr trump argued that his florida vote last month was different because he was out of the state on election day there are several challenges to expanding vote by mail for starters the current timeline is tight states that already have a system have had one in place for a long period of time for example it took washington several years to put the proper infrastructure in place across the state for vote by mail elections and even states that already have a robust absentee voting system say it will be difficult to scale up in time for november s election one difficulty in scaling up involves the fundamental process of printing and mailing ballots while a nationalized vote by mail system isn t likely to be implemented anytime soon experts say it is more likely that states move to expand options to augment in person voting following orders it s the biggest decision i ll ever make mr trump said friday about potentially reopening the country s economy by may 1 it s a decision that ultimately starts with the governors in at least 43 states that have issued statewide lockdowns and closed all non essential businesses which mr trump alluded to i have great authority if i wanted to use it i would rather have the states use it he said at his friday press conference cbs news legal analyst jonathan turley previously toldcbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarrothat if a governor has imposed a shelter in place order the president does not have authority to override that order turley doubled down on that analysis on friday tweeting there is a continuing false narrative that trump can open the country by some type of presidential edict he can t what the president can do is advise governors that they can loosen restrictions particularly in early areas of receded or low rates of virus that is no small degree of influence but it is a matter of persuasive rather than command authority while several states in the central united states have yet to issue stay at home orders both drs anthony fauci and deborah birx members of the white house coronavirus task force said those states have still put in effort to prevent any spikes such as contact tracing i really want to salute the governors of states particularly in the central part of the country if we pull out of this we re going to pull out of it in the big cities and we re going to pull out of it in those areas that aren t as densely populated fauci said fauci added that he s had calls with the governors in arkansas and wyoming earlier in the day still fauci cautioned against a full out reopening and said this is not the time to feel that since we have made such important advance in the sense of success of the mitigation that we need to pull back at all but mr trump said he will name a reopening our country council ontuesday and that he would put democrat and republican governors on the council i ve asked a couple of them so far they ve all said yes i think everyone would like to be on that council it s a very important council he said first published on april 10 2020 6 16 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the
