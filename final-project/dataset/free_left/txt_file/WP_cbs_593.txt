watch cbsn live september 24 2019 7 31 pm ap robert hunter the man behind the poetic and mystical words for many of the grateful dead s finest songs has died at age 78 hunter died monday at his northern california home with his wife maureen at his side former grateful dead publicist dennis mcnally told the associated press on tuesday the family did not release a cause of death we loved bob hunter and will miss him unimaginably grateful dead drummer mickey hart said adding the lyricist was a visionary wordsmith extraordinaire although proficient in a number of instruments including guitar violin cello and trumpet hunter never appeared on stage with the grateful dead during the group s 30 year run that ended with the 1995 death of lead guitarist jerry garcia his principal songwriting partner when he did attend the group s concerts he was content to either stand to the side of the stage or better yet sit anonymously in the audience it was in the latter location he told the associated press in 2006 that he received his greatest songwriting compliment from a man who had no idea who he was he turned to me during cumberland blues and said i wonder what the guy who wrote that song a hundred years ago would think if he knew the grateful dead was doing it he recalled referencing the colorful tale of hardscrabble american miners other of hunter s most memorable grateful dead songs include it must have been the roses terrapin station the days between brown eyed women jack straw friend of the devil box of rain uncle john s band and black muddy river although the man who spoke to him during cumberland blues couldn t know it he had perfectly captured hunter s songwriting brilliance contained in all of those songs the ability to craft lyrics that sounded so timeless that listeners were certain they had heard them before it was a skill he matched seamlessly with a boundless knowledge of subjects running the gamut from classic literature to street life which in turn allowed him to write authoritatively about everyone from card sharks and hustlers to poor dirt farmers and free spirited lovers all of those stories he seasoned with a poetic skill some would say rivaled even that of bob dylan with whom he sometimes collaborated he s got a way with words and i do too dylan told rolling stone magazine in 2009 we both write a different type of song than what passes today for songwriting there was nobody like bob hunter and there never will be hart said tuesday he explained the unexplainable and the words struck deep truckin arguably hunter and the group s best known song and the one containing the memorable line what a long strange trip it s been was designated a national treasure in 1997 by the library of congress once asked by the associated press who his influences were he laughed and replied that just to throw people off he would often cite both the great 19th century theatrical songwriting team of gilbert and sullivan and the american folk music balladeer woody guthrie after a moment s reflection he added more seriously actually that s pretty close to the truth other influencers included novelists james joyce john steinbeck and hans christian andersen musician josh white and the traditional european ballads published by american folklorist francis james child born robert burns on june 23 1941 hunter was 7 when his father abandoned him and his mother resulting in his spending several years in foster homes it was an experience he said scarred him emotionally and left him feeling forever the outsider when he was 11 his mother married mcgraw hill publishing executive norman hunter who gave the boy a new last name and an appreciation for such peerless writers like william saroyan and t s elliot hunter toyed with becoming a novelist himself but music called and by his senior year of high school he was playing trumpet in a fusion dixieland rock band he attended the university of connecticut for one year where he studied drama became a pete seeger fan and turned his interest to folk music he met garcia in 1960 at a production of the musical damn yankees introduced by a former girlfriend who by then was garcia s first wife the pair quickly formed a folk music duo called bob and jerry both homeless for a time they lived out of their cars parking them side by side in a palo alto california vacant lot they survived those days both would say later by eating tins of pineapple hunter had pilfered from a military installation during his brief time in the national guard hunter had moved to new mexico by the time garcia bob weir bill kreutzmann phil lesh and ron pigpen mckernan had formed the grateful dead hart would join soon after when garcia asked him to send some lyrics along that could be set to music hunter quickly responded with future grateful dead classics china cat sunflower and st stephen garcia then asked him to return to the san francisco bay area and write for the band eventually hunter would write for all of the group s members and when the grateful dead was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1994 he was included as the lyricist he and garcia were inducted into the songwriters hall of fame in 2015 over the years hunter also released nearly a dozen albums of his own published several volumes of poetry and co wrote songs with dylan he also published two books translating the works of german poet rainer maria rilke bob was an intellectual and i can t tell you that there are a lot of intellectuals in the rock and roll business but bob was an intellectual
