account thank youso much i am so thrilled to be back in reno thank you i have to say i know when i m here in reno i m the other hillary and i am more than okay with that because i think your mayor is doing a terrific job and the fact that she herself is a small business woman and committed to really lifting up reno and giving everybody in this great city the biggest little city with a big heart a chance to get ahead and stay ahead i could not be more honored than to have her support and endorsement in this race so thank you so much mayor schieve and let me also thank dr karen hilgerson and everybody here at truckee meadows community college i love community colleges and i know something about what this college is doing to give people of all ages not just young people a real chance to get the skills and opportunities that everybody in america deserves so thank you i have to begin by saying myoriginal plan for this visit was to focus on our agenda to help small businesses and entrepreneurs this week we proposed new steps to cut red tape and taxes to make it easier for small businesses to get the credit they need to grow and hire i want to be a small business president my father was a small business man and ibelieve that in america if you can dream it you should be able to build it and so we ll be talking a lot more about small business and about our economic plans in the days and weeks ahead but today here in this community college devoted to opening minds and creating great understanding of the world of which we live i want to address something that i am hearing about from americans all over our country everywhere i go people tell me how concerned they are by the divisive rhetoric coming from my opponent in this election and i understand that concern because it s like nothing we ve heard before from a nominee for president of the united states from one of our two major parties from the start donald trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia he is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take overthe republican party his disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous in just this past week under the guise of outreach to african americans trump has stood up in front of largely white audiences and described black communities in such insulting and ignorant terms poverty rejection horrible education no housing no homes no ownership crime at levels nobody has seen right now he said you walk down the street andget shot those are his words but when i hear them i think to myself how sad donald trump misses so much he doesn t see the success of black leaders in every field the vibrancy of black owned businesses the strength of the black church he doesn t see the excellence of historically black colleges and universities or the pride of black parents watching their children thrive and heapparently didn t see police chief brown on television after the murders of five of his officers conducting himself with such dignity he certainlydoesn t have any solutions to take on the reality of systemic racism and create more equity and opportunity in communities of color and for every american it really does take alot of nerve to ask people he s ignored and mistreated for decades what do you have to lose because the answer is everything now trump s lack of knowledge or experience or solutions would be bad enough but what he s doing here is more sinister trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters it s a disturbing preview of what kind of president he d be and that swhat i want to make clear today a man with a long history of racial discrimination who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far dark reaches of the internet should never run our government or command our military ask yourself if he doesn t respect all americans how can he serve all americans now i know some people still want to give trump the benefit of the doubt they hope that he will eventually reinvent himself that there s a kinder gentler more responsible donald trump waiting in the wings somewhere because after all it s hard to believe anyone let alone a nominee for president could really believe all the things he says but the hard truth is there s no other donald trump this is it maya angelou a great american whom i admire very much she once said when someone shows you who they are believe them the first time well throughout his career and this campaign donald trump has shown us exactly who he is we should believe him when trump was getting his start in business he was sued by the justice department for refusing to rent apartments to black and latino tenants their applications would be marked with a c c for colored and then rejected three years later the justice department took trump back to court because he hadn t changed and the pattern continued through the decades state regulators fined one of trump s casinos for repeatedly removing black dealers from the floor no wonder the turn over rate for his minority employees was way above average and let s not forget trump first gained political prominence leading the charge for the so called birthers he promoted the racist lie that president obama is not really an american citizen part of a sustained effort to delegitimize america s first black president in 2015 trump launched his own campaign for president with another racist lie he described mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals and he accused the mexican government of actively sending them across the border none of that is true oh and by the way mexico s not paying for his wall either if it ever gets built you can be sure that american taxpayers will be stuck with the bill but there hasbeen a steady stream of bigotry we all remember when trump said a distinguished federal judge born in indiana couldn t be trusted to do his job because quote he s a mexican think about that the man who today is the standard bearer of the republican party said a federal judge who by the way had a distinguished record as u s attorney had to go in hiding because mexican drug gangs were after him who has mexican heritage but just like me was born in this country is somehow incapable of doing his job solely because of his heritage even the republican speaker of the houseof representatives paul ryan described that and i quote as the textbook definition of a racist comment to this day trump has never apologized to judge curiel but for trump that is just par for the course this is someone who retweets white supremacists online like the user who goes by the name white genocide tm trump took this fringe bigot with a few dozen followers and spread his message to 11 million people his campaign famously posted an anti semitic image a star of david imposed over a sea of dollar bills that first appeared on a white supremacist websites the trump campaign has also selected a prominent white nationalist leader as a delegate in california and they only dropped him under pressure when asked in a nationally televised interview whether he would disavow the support of david duke a former grand wizardof the ku klux klan trump wouldn t do it and only later again under mounting pressure did he backtrack and when trump was asked about anti semitic slurs and death threats coming from his supporters he refused to condemn them through it all he has continued pushing discredited conspiracy theories with racist undertones you remember he said that thousands of american muslims in new jersey cheered the 9 11 attacks they didn t he suggested that ted cruz s father was involved in the kennedy assassination now perhaps in trump s mind because mr cruz was a cuban immigrant he must have had something to do with it and there isabsolutely of course no evidence of that just recently trump claimed that president obama founded isis and he hasrepeated that over and over again his latest paranoid fever dream is about my health all i can say is donald dream on this is what happens when you treat the national enquirer like gospel they said in october i d be dead in six months it s what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones who claims that 9 11 and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs he even said and this really is just so disgusting he even said the victims of the sandy hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there i don t know what happens in somebody s mind or how dark their heard must be to say things like that but trump didn t challenge those lies he actually went on jones show and said your reputation is amazing i will not let you down this from the man wants to be president of the united states you know i ve stood by president obama s side as he made the toughest decisions a commander in chief has to make in times of crisis our country depends on steady leadership clear thinking calm judgment because one wrong move can mean the difference between life and death i know we have veterans here and i know we have families mothers and spouses of people currently serving the last thing we need in the situation room is a loose cannon who can t tell the difference or doesn t care to between fact and fiction and who buys so easily into racially tinged rumors someone so detached from reality should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come that is yetanother reason why donald trump is simply temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states now i hear and i read some people who are saying that well his bluster and his bigotry is just over heated campaign rhetoric an outrageous person saying outrageous things for attention but look at his policies the ones that trump has proposed they would put prejudice into practice and don t be distracted by his latest attempts to muddy the waters he may have some new people putting new words in his mouth but we know where he stands he would form a deportation force to round up millions of immigrants and kick them out of the country he d abolish the bedrock constitutional principle that says if you re born in the united states you re an american citizen he says that children born into undocumented parents in america are anchor babies and should be deported millions of them and he d ban muslims around the world billions of them from entering our country just because of their religion think about that for a minute how would it actually work so people landing in u s airports would line up to get their passports stamped just like they do now but in trump s america when they step up to the counter the immigration officer would ask every single person what is your religion and then what what if someone says i m a christian but the agent doesn t believe him do they have to prove it how would they do that really ever since the pilgrims landed on plymouth rock america has distinguished itself as a haven for people fleeing religious persecution believing in religious freedom and religious liberty under donald trump america would distinguish itself as the only country in the world to impose a religious test at the border come to think of it there actually may be one other place that does that the so called islamic state the territory that isis controls what a would be a cruel ironythat someone running for president would equate us with them don t worry some will say as president trump will be surrounded by smart advisers who will rein in his worst impulses so when a tweet gets under his skin and he wants to retaliate with a cruise missile maybe cooler heads will convince him not to well maybe but look at who he s put in charge of his campaign trump likes to say he only hires the best people but he s had to fire so many campaign managers it s like an episode fromthe apprentice the latest shake up was designed to quote let trump be trump to do that he hired stephen bannon the head of a right wing website called breitbart com as campaign ceo to give you a flavor of his work here are a few headlines they ve published birth control makes women unattractive and crazy would you rather your child had feminism or cancer gabby giffords the gun control movement s human shield hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage that one came shortly after the charleston massacre when democrats and republicans alike were doing everything they could to heal racial divides breitbart tried to enflame them further just imagine donald trump reading that and thinking this is what i need more of in my campaign bannon has nasty things to say about pretty much everyone this spring he railed against paul ryan for quote rubbing his social justice catholicism in my nose every second no wonder he s gone to work for trump the only presidential candidate ever to get into a public feud with the pope it s truly hard to believe but according to the southern poverty law center which tracks hate groups breitbart embraces ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right this is not conservatism as we have known it this is not republicanism as we have know it these are race baiting ideas anti muslim and anti immigrant ideas anti woman all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the alt right now alt right is short for alternative right the wall street journal describes it as a loose but organized movement mostly online that rejects mainstream conservatism promotes nationalism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity the de facto merger between breitbart and the trump campaign represents a landmark achievement for the alt right a fringe element has effectively taken over the republican party and this is part of a broader story the rising tide of hardline right wing nationalism around the world just yesterday one of britain s most prominent right wing leaders a man named nigel farage who stoked anti immigrant sentiments to win the referendum to have britain leave theeuropean union campaigned with donald trump in mississippi farage has called for a bar on the children of legal immigrants from public schools and health services has said women are and i quote worth less than men and supports scrapping laws that prevent employers from discriminating based on race that s who donald trump wants by his side when he is addressing an audience of american voters and the grand godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism is russian president vladimir putin in fact farage regularly appears on russian propaganda programs now he s standing on the same stage as the republican nominee trump himself heaps praise on putin and embraces pro russian policies he talks casually of abandoning our nato allies recognizing russia s annexation of crimea and of giving the kremlin a free hand in eastern europe more generally american presidents from truman to reagan have rejected the kind of approach trump is taking on russia we should too now all of this adds up to something we ve never seen before of course there has always been a paranoid fringe in our politics a lot of it rising fromracial resentment but it s never had the nominee of a major party stoking it encouraging it and giving it a national megaphone until now on david duke s radio show the other day the mood was jubilant we appear to have taken over the republican party one white supremacist said duke laughed no there s still more work to do he replied so no one should have any illusions about what s really going on here the names may have changed racists now call themselves racialists white supremacists now call themselves white nationalists the paranoid fringe now calls itself alt right but the hate burns just as bright and now trump is trying to rebrand himself as well but don t be fooled there s an old mexican proverb that says tell me with whom you walk and i will tell you who you are we know who trump is a few words on a teleprompter won t change that he says he wants to make america great again but more and more it seems as though his real message seems to be make america hate again and this isn t just about one election it s about who we are as a nation it s about the kind of example we want to set for our children and grandchildren next time you seetrump rant on television think about all the childrenlistening across america kidshear a lot more than we think parents and teachers are already worried about what they re calling the trump effect they report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools especially targeting students of color muslims and immigrants at a recent high school basketball game in indiana white students held up trump signs and taunted latino players on the opposing team with chants of build the wall and speak english after a similar incident in iowa one frustrated school principal said they see it in a presidential campaign and now it s ok for everyone to say this we wouldn t tolerate thiskind of behavior and we wouldn t tolerate it in our own homes and we should not stand for itfrom apresidential candidate you know my friends thisis a moment of reckoning for every republican dismayed that the party of lincoln has become the party of trump it s a moment of reckoning for all of us who love our country and believe that america is better than this twenty years ago when bob dole accepted the republican nomination he pointed to the exits and told any racists in the party to get out the week after 9 11 george w bush went to a mosque and declared for everyone to hear that muslims love america just as much as i do in 2008 john mccain told his own supporters they were wrong about the man he was trying to defeat senator mccain made sure they knew barack obama he said is an american citizen and a decent person we need that kind of leadership again we can have our disagreements and believe me i understand that i think that s healthy we need good debates but we need to do it in a respectful way not finger pointing and blaming and stirring up this bigotry and prejudice every day more americans are standing up and saying enough is enough including a lot of republicans and i am honored to have their support and i promise you this with your help i will be a president for democrats republicans and independents for those who vote for me and for those whovote against me i will be a president forall americans because i truly believe we are stronger together and this isa vision for the future rooted in our values and reflected in a rising generation of young people the young people in america today are the most open diverse and connected we ve ever seen howmany of you saw the olympics i was so proud i always get carried away every time the olympics are on and you look at the diversity of our athletes just look at our fabulous olympic team representing the united states of america like ibtihaj muhammad an african american muslim from new jersey who won the bronze medal in fencing with grace and skill would she even have a place in donald trump s america and i ll tell ya when i was growing up in so many parts of our country simone manuel would not have been allowed to swim in the same public pool as katie ledecky and now together on our swimming team they re winning olympic medals as teammates i don t know about you but i don t think we have a person to waste we want to build an america where every person has a place where if you work hard and do yourpart you can get ahead and stay ahead that s the basic bargain of america and we cannot get to wherewe need to be unless we standtogether and stand up againstprejudice and paranoia and prove once and for allthat america is great because is america is good thank you all let s go out and win the election may god bless the
