advertisement supported by by michael barbaro and jonathan martin manchester n h frustrated and flailing as his candidacy threatens to slip away gov chris christie of new jersey is embarking on a scalding effort over the next week to discredit senator marco rubio of florida the man he blames for undermining his campaign and whose ascendancy he deeply resents and mr christie has a secret ally jeb bush mr christie whose white house hopes hinge on a strong showing in new hampshire is unleashing the kind of cutting and personal attacks that brought him renown in new jersey but that pose a far greater risk in a presidential campaign where they can harm the assailant as much as the intended target over the past 48 hours mr christie has mocked mr rubio as a cosseted boy in the bubble derided him as constantly scripted likened him to the king of england and perhaps most creatively compared his senate career to that of a helpless fourth grader who is told which chair to sit in at school on wednesday mr christie challenged anyone to show me the significant accomplishment that senator rubio has done while he s in the united states senate i can t find one mr christie added for mr christie the verbal barrage is a carefully calibrated attempt to damage mr rubio s standing in new hampshire before tuesday s primary and to set up a showdown with him in saturday night s republican debate possibly mr christie s best chance to impede mr rubio s surging candidacy mr rubio s strong third place performance in iowa on monday night and his steady improvement in the polls days before the voting there alarmed mr christie and his mainstream republican rivals including mr bush who fear mr rubio s emerging as a breakout figure in new hampshire the shared concern has even prompted the opening of a back channel members of the bush and christie campaigns have communicated about their mutual desire to halt mr rubio s rise in the polls according to republican operatives familiar with the conversations while emails texts and phone calls between operatives in rival campaigns are not uncommon in the tight knit world of political strategists the contact among senior aides in the two campaigns has drifted toward musings about what can be done to stop or at least slow mr rubio the operatives said in a sign of a budding alliance the aides have for example exchanged news articles that raise potential areas of vulnerability for mr rubio there is no formal coordination the operatives stressed but rather a recognition of a shared agenda we do have similar goals an adviser to mr christie said for their part mr christie and mr bush are praising each other in public and cozying up to each other in private mr bush telephoned mr christie on monday to wish him good luck in the caucuses mr christie was not available and the call went to voice mail during a cnn interview wednesday mr bush put their bond on display for all to see i love chris christie said mr bush a former governor of florida he is a he s a great campaigner he s a good friend and he s been an effective governor a division of labor seems to have taken hold while a well financed super pac supporting mr bush assails mr rubio on television and in the mail mr christie has increased the critiques on the campaign trail jeb can t do that sort of stuff said an adviser to mr christie referring to the new jersey governor s slashing boy in the bubble attack on mr rubio and his comfort with political street fighting they don t have the weapon the alliance makes sense operatives said a strong primary night in new hampshire for mr rubio would allow him to make a compelling case to voters and donors that he is the surest bet for unifying the party against its most divisive presidential contenders donald j trump and senator ted cruz of texas after the iowa caucuses the paths to the nomination diverge for the three leading candidates and it would make it harder for mr bush and mr christie to justify remaining in the race as the primary nears mr christie is expressing disapproval for mr rubio in increasingly elaborate and colorful ways at londonderry high school he found a fourth grader named matthew in the audience and posed a series of questions about his daily routine did he have a set time when he had to be at school yes the boy said an assigned desk to sit in the boy nodded a list of questions to answer each day and a summer break matthew answered affirmatively mr christie pounced they do that in the united states senate too the audience roared the senate he said was a foolhardy place from which to pick a president what we are all wondering is how does that train you to be president mr christie said because that s not the way the presidency works and it is certainly not the way the governorship works speaking to reporters in manchester on thursday mr rubio said that the joint attacks from his rivals were silly look when people are having a tough time in a campaign especially near the end you see some desperation set in and so they ll start saying things but i m not too worried about that joe pounder a spokesman for mr rubio also dismissed the criticism pointing to a record that he suggested was outside the republican mainstream no amount of hot air or made up facts can distract from chris christie s liberal record he said for mr christie there is a personal dimension to the onslaught against mr rubio after mr christie started to gain in the polls in new hampshire late last year allies of mr rubio paid for a ferocious series of television advertisements and direct mail pieces attacking the new jersey governor for deviations from conservative orthodoxy and over the gridlock creating lane closures near the george washington bridge overseen by his allies in a final flourish they showed images of mr christie together with president obama evoking a divisive moment after hurricane sandy when the governor praised and warmly greeted the president beyond that mr christie evidently feels a sense of betrayal over the inroads that mr rubio has made with major republican donors particularly the new york area financiers whom mr christie spent years courting so he got a couple of donors mr christie sniffed adding good for him advertisement
