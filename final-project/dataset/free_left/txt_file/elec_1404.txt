newsletter on the trail received this piece in their in boxes sign up to receive future installments early tuesday morning ohio became the fourth state after louisiana georgia and kentucky to postpone a primary election because of covid 19 the decision which came just hours before polls were scheduled to open was made by governor mike dewine who argued that voting would put older americans especially poll workers at risk of contracting the virus in response john cranley the mayor of cincinnati issued a public statement i believe the governor made this decision because he believes it is right for public health he wrote however i worry that the precedent could haunt future elections by people who are not motivated by the same public good in ohio voters already have the right to request an absentee ballot and send it in through the mail because it seems unlikely that a new in person election could be held anytime soon cranley continued i am calling on the state to mail absentee ballots to all registered voters and encourage mail in voting primary and local election dates are to an extent fungible when hurricane andrew ravaged parts of florida in 1992 and hurricane katrina decimated the gulf coast thirteen years later officials changed the dates of pending elections september 11 2001 was a municipal primary day in new york after the planes hit voting was halted and rescheduled for two weeks later more recently the 2018 new york primary was moved to avoid conflicting with both 9 11 and rosh hashanah general elections are different their dates are set by federal law so changing them would require an act of congress and the blessing of the president even then a date change would most likely have to withstand a challenge in the courts the new yorker s coronavirus news coverage and analysis are free for all readers lately i ve been hearing people point out that a presidential election was held in the midst of the civil war which illustrates either the commitment of american voters or the unyielding calendar of our democracy a pandemic with its invisible enemy presents a more miasmic challenge to voting though microbes are indiscriminate anyone and everyone is susceptible but while it is true that public polling places present a threat to public health it is equally true that not voting is a threat to the health of the republic could donald trump who in the past has joked about staying in office past his term use covid 19 to subvert the electoral process a recent piece in slate lays out a frightening scenario where trump could in essence hijack the electoral college richard l hasen a law professor at the university of california irvine and the author of election meltdown told me that in such a scenario there would be rioting in the streets the next general election is on november 3rd insuring free fair and safe elections will require providing everyone the ability to vote without having to step into the public sphere hasen s solution is to give voters the option though not the obligation to vote by mail this is also the goal of new legislation proposed by senators ron wyden of oregon and amy klobuchar of minnesota wyden told me every jurisdiction already allows absentee voting for members of the military or people who can t make it to the polls so we re not starting from scratch five states have universal vote by mail and thirty allow voters to request an absentee ballot without having to provide an excuse even so scaling up in time for the november election wyden believes we have no more than six months to get there will present challenges an earlier bill introduced by wyden the resilient elections during quarantines and natural disasters act of 2020 proposes five hundred million dollars in grants to help all fifty states institute mail in voting the brennan center for justice at new york university estimates the real cost would range from 951 million to 1 4 billion the klobuchar wyden bill does not suggest a specific allocation but klobuchar told me that congress should make sure that this transition does not burden the states there are more than nine thousand voting districts in the country with varying rules and regulations some will require an act of the state legislature to allow no excuse absentee voting some will require a constitutional amendment and then there are the logistics it is highly unusual to introduce a new way of voting during a general election election officials will need time and training to adapt and they may not have either in wyden s home state of oregon which allows universal vote by mail every voter is sent a ballot and a prepaid return envelope with a tracking bar code inside this preserves anonymity and enables voters to check that their marked ballot was received one of the provisions of wyden s bill however would allow voters to receive their ballots electronically and print them at home that s convenient and expedient but it raises security concerns anytime you have people voting outside a polling place hasen said there is going to be the possibility of coercion vote tampering and ballots that get tossed out there are other concerns as well in some cases clerks have disproportionately challenged the authenticity of signatures on mail in ballots cast by people of color and younger voters a 2018 report by the a c l u of florida for example found that younger and racial and ethnic minority voters casting vbm ballots were at least twice as likely as older and white voters to have their vbm ballot rejected in the presidential elections of 2012 and 2016 king county washington which has had universal mail in voting since 2005 tries to pre mpt this kind of disenfranchisement by sending a ballot rejection challenge form and prepaid envelope within a day to voters whose ballots were not accepted and voting by mail is a less than optimal solution for voters without a fixed address or those who live on tribal lands we know it s not going to be perfect klobuchar told me but we need to push as many people as we can to vote early as well as to vote by mail on wednesday she and wyden introduced the national disaster and emergency ballot act of 2020 a hybrid of proposals from both senators to preserve and protect the franchise klobuchar who has been talking with roy blunt her republican colleague from missouri to garner bipartisan support is especially keen to see states introduce a twenty day early voting period which would allow people who need or prefer to vote in person to do so without having to encounter crowds this would also lessen the exposure of poll workers the majority of whom are over sixty which puts them at high risk if they were to contract covid 19 the klobuchar wyden bill also proposes training high school and college students as poll workers it is not lost on either senator that efforts to pass election security legislation have been stymied by the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell for the past three years and that republicans around the country have pursued policies to limit the franchise and suppress the vote it is also not lost on their republican colleagues that states which have universal vote by mail have seen an increase in voter participation but that does not necessarily favor democrats hasen pointed out that republican voters who skew older may prefer voting at home he also said that until recently republicans were more likely to vote that way than democrats one democratic operative i spoke with worried that if much of the country were to vote by mail in november the republicans would have the advantage because they actually return the ballots wyden reminded me that utah a state that is as red as it gets votes by mail in other words giving voters the option to vote by mail over a longer election period is not a stealth way to enlarge the franchise it s a way to preserve it we re in an unprecedented emergency hasen said let s solve november and we can worry about other things later how to practice social distancing from responding to a sick housemate to the pros and cons of ordering food how people cope and create new customs
