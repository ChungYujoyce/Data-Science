guide to the day in national politics i m nick corasaniti your host on tuesdays for our coverage of all things media and messaging sign up here to get on politics in your inbox every weekday if you re like me you ve been getting about two or three text messages a day from the biden and trump presidential campaigns with the anticipatory excitement that accompanies each incoming text ding quickly dulled by yet another mass message no just me ok well for those of you who receive only one candidate s texts or none at all we re going to take a trip down imessage memory lane and look at some of the texts from president trump and joe biden and what they say about their campaigns messaging strategies mass texting is largely a fund raising tool allowing campaigns to instantly solicit contributions from thousands or even millions of supporters the texts arrive from five digit numbers 303 30 for mr biden and 880 22 for mr trump if you ve received a text from a full 10 digit cellphone number asking you to join an organizing event that s a different campaigning tool and the messages are coming directly from real people we ll cover those another time the trump campaign s mass texting style adheres closely to mr trump s twitter feed not a single text goes out without some word in all capital letters and the texts are rarely longer than a tweet they also tend to follow the substance of the president s social feeds usually animated by grievances in april of last year there were texts from president trump declaring that we must stop the massive caravans and urging supporters to donate now in august don jr was condemning representative joaquin castro the texas democrat who had shared personal info of trump donors despicable also donate now when the impeachment process began a daily deluge of texts hit trump supporters repeatedly labeling the process a hoax and witch hunt and total scam all with links to donate for the trump campaign texting has become an essential way to monetize the outrage mr trump can instill in his base done right in the moment with more urgency than mass emails within hours of the senate s voting to acquit mr trump the campaign sent out a text proclaiming him vindicated and promising a 4x match on donations across the trump campaign s texts facebook ads and email blasts the messaging is almost always in sync when the campaign is advertising on facebook to donate for a gold card or hawking st patrick s day campaign merchandise the texting closely follows texts from the biden campaign are unsurprisingly markedly different words are rarely in all caps and the tone can be downright polite at least half a dozen texts have simply started with please others state i hate asking for money the text message version of mr biden even apologizes if he corresponds late in the day hey it s joe biden hope i didn t catch you too late read a text from march 31 received at 8 28 p m on the east coast and while the trump campaign s messages can be almost alarmingly direct with someone who hasn t donated in a while lapsed read one the biden campaign plays a bit more passive aggressively is this the right number a biden text read in early january the texts often follow mr biden s loquacious style with many messages broken into multiple paragraphs one text sent on dec 27 began with quick it s joe biden then stretched for five paragraphs requiring the user to scroll through lines like beating donald trump is the fight of our lives failure isn t an option the biden campaign has been using its messages to tease major campaign developments a recent text to those anxiously awaiting my pick for vp promised those who signed up via a link would be among the first to know the campaign has also occasionally used the mass texts to collect data on its supporters one text asked users to share their opinions of voting by mail and as with the v p tease didn t ask for money a text sent on sunday asked voters to fill out a survey with their emails zip codes and cellphone numbers indicating whether they would vote for mr biden in the general election clearly both campaigns do their best to adhere to the style of their candidate and they have to in order to be effective sliding into the text messages on a personal cellphone is among the most intimate forms of outreach in a campaign s messaging arsenal so it s no surprise that the trump campaign s texting takes on the familiar tone of the president s twitter feed there is however one phrase that has been conspicuously absent from the biden campaign s messages in 2020 there was no mention of malarkey drop us a line we want to hear from our readers have a question we ll try to answer it have a comment we re all ears email us at onpolitics nytimes com for the past 48 hours the trump campaign has been running a set of three attack ads attempting to tie two messages together first the ads try to blame china for the coronavirus outbreak then they blast joe biden for criticizing president trump s decision in january to restrict travel from china the campaign has spent about 420 000 so far on the ads running them in swing states like florida wisconsin and pennsylvania the ad with the most money behind it responsible has aired 160 times in florida markets over the past two days as it becomes increasingly clear that the trump campaign will continue with its xenophobic messaging on china the message in the first few seconds the ad sounds like a democratic attack ad as a narrator proclaims the coronavirus infected millions and crushed the world economy but quickly a map of china fills the screen as the narrator exclaims one nation deserves the blame china halfway through the ad the message shifts to mr biden who the narrator claims coddles china black and white footage of mr biden provides the visual contrast the takeaway the ad dovetails with mr trump s strategy of assuming no responsibility for the severity of the outbreak in the united states and pinning the blame on china it also seeks to highlight tenuous ties between mr biden and china over all it illustrates the challenge facing mr trump in the general election even as he goes on the offensive against mr biden he ll have to continually defend his response to the pandemic as well here are the live results from special elections in california and wisconsin and primaries in
