response coordinatordr deborah birxsays a similar trend has been seen of young people being hospitalized in europe there are concerning reports coming out of france and italy about some young people getting seriously ill and very seriously ill in the icus birx said in a white house news conference wednesday we think part of this may be that people heeded the early data coming out of china and coming out of south korea about the elderly or those with preexisting medical condition who are at particular risk it may have been that the millennial generation there may be disproportional

that s how infectious i am so if i hypothetically have the disease i can spread it we think with coronavirus to three people that reproduction number is affected by the virus properties itself who is susceptible but also the duration of contact with individuals and the number of people you contact decreasing the number of people you contact and the duration can significantly slow down the spread
