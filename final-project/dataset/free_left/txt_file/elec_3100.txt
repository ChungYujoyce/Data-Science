in the 48 hours after former vice president joe biden won a dominant victory in the south carolina democratic presidential primary two of his competitors for the party s nomination suspended their campaigns both sen amy klobuchar minn and former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg joined biden in texas on monday evening to offer him their endorsements before the state s primary on tuesday those endorsements were important though the effects are hard to evaluate at the moment what may be more important are the 33 delegates that buttigieg and klobuchar have already won buttigieg finished in the top tier in both iowa and new hampshire holding the lead in delegates briefly klobuchar parlayed a strong debate performance largely targeting buttigieg incidentally into a smaller pile in new hampshire so what happens to those delegates now what happens to delegates moving forward as candidates withdraw the best way to answer that question is to look at the rest of the campaign in two parts before and during the democratic convention it s worth quickly reviewing how delegates are allocated most states hold primaries in which several pools of delegates are awarded as follows the process for caucuses ends up in the same place but with more cumbersome math the upshot for our discussion is those candidates pledged to buttigieg and klobuchar are they still pledged josh putnam is a political scientist who focuses on delegate rules he both considered the question on his website frontloading hq and spoke with the washington post about what happens one distinction putnam draws is that while we generally talk about who won how many delegates in the contests so far for the most part no one actually has any delegates at this point those delegates will be assigned at party conventions later in the year instead candidates have mostly won delegate slots placeholders for delegates to be assigned later the mostly qualifiers there are a carve out for some district delegates in new hampshire who ve already been selected this is important because those slots will be filled with delegates for only those candidates who are still in the race in new hampshire for example if buttigieg is no longer a candidate by the time of the state convention the three delegates he won by virtue of his statewide vote total would be redistributed among the other candidates still in the race who d crossed the 15 percent statewide threshold since the other two candidates earning statewide delegates in new hampshire were klobuchar and sen bernie sanders i vt the effect would be that sanders gets all of those delegates putnam s interpretation of the rules is that by suspending their campaigns as opposed to dropping out buttigieg and klobuchar can protect their delegates from being reallocated the democratic national committee however disagrees they re out of the race in june iowa s delegates will be resorted to those candidates who are still in sanders if he is once the convention rolls around the party will hold a vote among the delegates in attendance to determine the party s nominee on the first ballot pledged delegates are expected to vote for the candidates they are there to represent if there s no majority on the first ballot another round of voting is held in which unpledged superdelegates mostly party leaders and elected officials have a say and in which delegate pledges are set aside that expected to vote for is important of course pledged delegates are pledged in the same way that teenagers pledge not to smoke the success of the pledge largely comes down to their willingness to abide by it and their relationship with the candidates they re meant to represent campaigns do their best to make sure that their pledged delegates uphold those pledges during the selection process once delegates at any level of any type are selected the campaigns have the ability to review those candidates that are selected to represent them at the convention putnam said so typically these are pretty loyal people if you re talking about a well organized campaign anyway that s been involved in this process from the start and if they re involved at the presidential level they usually are in other words biden s campaign will work to ensure that its pledged delegates are fervent biden supporters and not people who might get to the convention and suddenly decide that maybe sanders is worth a vote that s useful too for any second or third round of voting a die hard biden loyalist will probably keep voting for biden as long as the biden campaign wants him to you ll notice that we haven t yet talked about the congressional district delegates representing candidates who ve suspended their campaigns those delegates would go to the convention unpledged meaning that they can vote for anyone they want on the first ballot while both candidates may retain some control over who gets selected putnam wrote monday they do not have full control over any delegates selected to represent them the delegates who are going to the convention on buttigieg s behalf probably aren t going to be the sorts of loyalists that biden or sanders would send since that requires a somewhat robust campaign infrastructure when states hold the conventions at which delegates are picked it s therefore somewhat less likely that buttigieg can effectively wield those delegates in negotiations over the nominee assuming the convention moves through multiple rounds of voting without a candidate earning a majority of delegates buttigieg klobuchar and other suspended candidates can encourage their delegates to vote for a particular candidate biden for the first two but that request is less like a parent insisting a kid stop smoking than it is like a random adult passing by and yelling at teenagers smoking cigarettes in a park just to extend that particular analogy the weight is limited putnam notes that we re not talking about many delegates here anyway if the democratic nomination comes down to a 20 delegate margin between sanders and biden these calculations and the decisions of the delegates themselves become fraught it s more likely that it will be the unpledged superdelegates who are the determining factor the party decides as it were the article was corrected to reflect the democratic national committee s assessment of the delegate rules
