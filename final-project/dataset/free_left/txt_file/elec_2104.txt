the gop nominee was the highest profile figure to question president obama s birthplace one of the oddest features of the 2016 presidential race is that the republican nominee donald trump emerged on the political scene this decade by repeatedly questioning whether president barack obama was born in america and yet it seems trump s embrace of this crackpot conspiracy theory has hardly been discussed during this campaign yes the gop nominee was the highest profile birther for much of 2011 and continued to perpetuate the movement s debunked nonsense for many years afterward despite it being fringe racist nonsense now though the washington post s robert costa has elevated the subject again in an interview with trump on wednesday costa asked the candidate whether he now believed obama was born in hawaii and trump refused to answer i ll answer that question at the right time trump told costa i just don t want to answer it yet and when costa followed up by pointing out that trump s top adviser kellyanne conway has said that trump now believed obama was born in the us trump was noncommittal it s okay she s allowed to speak what she thinks trump told costa i want to focus on jobs i want to focus on other things hours after costa s story was posted on thursday trump adviser jason miller sent out a statement claiming that mr trump believes that president obama was born in the united states furthermore miller ludicrously tried to give trump credit for bringing this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling president obama to release his birth certificate as if he were doing some sort of public service finally on friday trump himself begrudgingly gave an extremely brief statement that president barack obama was born in the united states period and again dishonestly blamed clinton for supposedly starting the controversy but he shouldn t be allowed to worm out of this so easily because birtherism is in many ways the urtext of trump s presidential campaign it demonstrates his willingness to mainstream fringe racism his desire to flout the norms of political discourse his ability to play the media and his imperviousness to facts and trump has never truly been held to account for it during this campaign the us constitution requires that the president of the united states be a natural born citizen obama is one by virtue of having been born in hawaii to a us citizen mother but birthers raised the question what if he wasn t when obama first ran for president in 2008 he had a very different background from all previous presidential nominees he wasn t white his middle name was hussein and he had lived abroad for several years as a child and the fever swamps of the internet responded to this by letting their imaginations run wild one fringe theory was that obama was a secret muslim another was that he was lying about having been born in hawaii and was in fact born in another country likely kenya and was therefore ineligible for the presidency this chatter first emerged during the contentious 2008 democratic primary but was limited to chain emails and such rather than being associated with anyone prominent according to politico it then continued during the general election and obama s presidency and was embraced by little known fringe figures like orly taitz and philip berg and the right wing pundit jerome corsi it never made a lick of sense in the summer of 2008 the obama campaign released his shortform birth certificate from the hawaii department of health fact checkers examined it and were satisfied that it was authentic furthermore there were contemporaneous announcements of obama s birth printed in hawaiian newspapers at the time then in 2011 obama finally dredged up his longform birth certificate but since conspiracy theorists are conspiracy theorists they invented all sorts of reasons to dismiss and disbelieve all this evidence as trump publicly considered a presidential campaign against obama in 2011 he gained media attention and popularity on the right by becoming the highest profile birther ever here s the timeline who are you kidding it s very hard to convince conspiracy theorists that they re wrong with evidence because they will just invent new reasons to disbelieve any piece of evidence they don t like plus this is donald trump we re talking about so contrary to his campaign s transparently false statement that trump brought closure to the issue in 2011 trump continued to spread nonsense about it for years afterward and come up with new bogus reasons not to believe the document obama released let s take a closer look at that birth certificate barackobama was described in 2003 as being born in kenya http t co vfqjesjl an extremely credible source has called my office and told me that barackobama s birth certificate is a fraud why do the republicans keep apologizing on the so called birther issue no more apologies take the offensive wake up america see article israeli science obama birth certificate is a fake http t co f7esudsz how amazing the state health director who verified copies of obama s birth certificate died in plane crash today all others lived attention all hackers you are hacking everything else so please hack obama s college records destroyed and check place of birth but other than all that there was closure just remember the birther movement was started by hillary clinton in 2008 she was all in there s no evidence that hillary clinton or her 2008 campaign had anything to do with the birther theory none nonpartisan fact checkers have repeatedly debunked this claim as you can see at politifact factcheck cnn and the washington post now the small grain of truth here is that a few clinton supporters did circulate the theory online during the contentious 2008 primary according to politico s ben smith though it s not really clear that they were the first to do so as smith claims since there was contemporaneous chatter about this inright wing circles onlineat the time too but once the primary concluded and obama first released his birth certificate that summer this chatter quieted down in democratic circles and moved instead to more conspiracy focused and right wing precincts update this piece was updated with trump s statement on friday and some new links on the origins of the birther
