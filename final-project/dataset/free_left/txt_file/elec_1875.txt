9 27 a m et president trump tried out his own midterm playbook tuesday at a campaign rally in tennessee by ramping up his rhetoric on illegal immigration and gang related crimes the president s main goal with the nashville event was to campaign for gop rep marsha blackburn who finds herself in a close senate contest with former democratic gov phil bredesen that could be pivotal in deciding control of the senate i ve never heard of this guy who is he trump chided bredesen he s an absolute tool of chuck schumer and of course the ms 13 lover nancy pelosi it was a new moniker for the house minority leader and trump doubled down on controversial comments he d made earlier this month about the drug gang what was the name the president prodded the crowd who yelled back animals they re not human beings trump added saying that they use glaring loopholes in our immigration laws in order to infiltrate our country and rape murder and cut people up into little pieces trump did touch briefly on other issues that republicans want to be a focus of their midterm messaging such as the gop s tax cuts and the economy but it was immigration that was the overarching focus of his speech meanwhile congressional leaders have been working to avoid a fight on immigration as moderates have been pushing for action on the deferred actions for childhood arrivals daca program trump defended his hardline immigration rhetoric central to his 2016 campaign as an asset for the midterms and you can say what you want but i think border security and security in general is a great issue for the republican party trump said i think it s a great issue not a bad issue the white house has repeatedly highlighted victims of gang violence as evidence that the u s needs more stringent immigration laws including rolling back some forms of legal immigration critics however say the administration is simply exploiting such tragedies for political gain and to disparage hispanic immigrants it s a campaign tactic that gop gubernatorial nominee ed gillespie tried in last year s virginia elections and lost handily but trump ramped up his original rhetoric on immigration and ms 13 on thursday night nonetheless even returning to some of his tried and true favorites from the presidential campaign trail on his prized southern u s border wall which he s struggled to get congressional funding for trump promised the crowd that in the end mexico s gonna pay for the wall implying it would be done via renegotiating the north american free trade agreement nafta they re gonna pay for the wall and they re going to enjoy it the president went on to claim mexican president enrique pe a nieto however had a very different response later via twitter president realdonaldtrump no mexico will never pay for a wall not now not ever sincerely mexico all of us trump carried tennessee in 2016 by 26 points so his efforts on behalf of blackburn can greatly buoy her in the state against bredesen a popular former two term governor who was easily re elected last in 2006 trump was largely on message tuesday night not even veering off to talk about the news of the day abc s cancellation of roseanne after its star roseanne barr went on a racist twitter rant earlier this year the president had called the comedian whose character was a trump supporter to congratulate her on its ratings dominance instead trump did try to tie phil whatever the hell his name is who s tried to campaign on bipartisanship and pragmatism to the national democratic party as a whole if bredesen were ever to get elected he would do whatever chuck and nancy want trump said they don t want the wall they want open borders they re more interested in taking care of criminals than they are of taking care of you bredesen donated a lot of money to the campaigns of barack obama and hillary clinton crooked hillary trump added gleefully as the crowd predictably returned to the routine campaign trail chant of lock her up lock her up the full throated endorsement of blackburn was important for her as she struggled early on to unify some of the state gop behind her in her quest to succeed retiring sen bob corker who briefly flirted with reversing his decision not to seek re election however the sometimes trump critic would have likely lost to blackburn in the primary after saying he wouldn t run in a cnn interview corker made glowing remarks about bredesen but only muted general comments about blackburn without using her name blackburn has long been a vocal trump backer and in brief remarks to the crowd she promised she d be a stalwart ally for the president if elected tennessee needs a senator who is going to support president donald trump and i am going to be there to stand with president donald trump to take your tennessee values to washington d c blackburn pledged corker has tried to mend fences with trump after the senate foreign relations committee chairman questioned the president s fitness for office and diplomatic approaches last year while corker and the state s senior senator lamar alexander were in attendance tuesday night the very pro trump crowd wasn t shy in expressing their displeasure when trump ticked off corker s name while listing other gop officials attendees loudly booed npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
