advertisement supported by he can t beat her coronavirus by thomas l friedman opinion columnist on easter as the coronavirus was rapidly spreading npr s weekend all things considered carried excerpts from sermons from across the country i was particularly touched by the way presiding bishop michael curry ended his talk at washington national cathedral singing he s got the whole world in his hands he s got the whole world in his hands it was a powerful close that left me thinking just substitute she for he and you ve defined the core problem we re facing for the first time in the life of our generation of human species mother nature has the whole world in her hands the entire planet is collectively facing the same challenges from the same coronavirus at the same time that has been the starting point of all my analyses i try to ground all my thoughts on how to deal with this pandemic in the logic of mother nature and the laws of natural systems if you don t if instead you start your analysis with politics or ideology or the fact that you re just tired of being locked down so what the hell let s throw back a few with the gang at the local bar and the virus be damned you re actually challenging mother nature to a duel and no one seems to be doing that more these days than president trump who s practically been sounding the all clear lately mother nature s powers be damned i understand how people are desperate to save their businesses and get their salaries back anyone reading this column knows my heart has been with them from the start but if you define wearing a mask or restrictions on the size of religious gatherings as a sign of disrespect for your personal freedom not an act of respect for mother nature when she has the whole world in her hands you re making a huge mistake let s remember mother nature is just chemistry biology and physics and the engine that drives her is one thing natural selection that is the quest of all organisms to survive and thrive in some ecological niche as they engage in the struggle to pass on their dna to their next generation and not end up among those that get returned to the manufacturer and decommissioned and that s what viruses do too try to survive and replicate the coronavirus for instance co evolved with bats in the wild but it apparently jumped to humans when someone ate an infected mammal in wuhan china when it did it made a warm home in human cells and tissues in ways that can harm or kill us once that happened the coronavirus became just another one of mother nature s fastballs that she throws at us to see who s the fittest mother nature is not only all powerful she s also unfeeling unlike that merciful god that most humans worship mother nature doesn t keep score she can inflict her virus on your grandmother on monday and blow down your house with a tornado on wednesday and come back on friday and flood your basement she can hit you in the spring give you a warm hug in summer and hammer you in the fall as such telling her that you re fed up with being locked down that it s enough already doesn t actually register with her all that registers all that she rewards is one thing adaptation she doesn t reward the richest or the strongest or the smartest of the species she rewards the most adaptive they get to pass along their dna and in a pandemic that means she rewards a president governor mayor or citizen who first and foremost respects her power if you don t respect her viruses wildfires droughts hurricanes floods and so on she will hurt you or your neighbors or your citizens president trump doesn t respect mother nature because he measures everything in terms of money and markets he has no feel for natural systems except golf courses where he developed the illusion that he could tame nature even building man made waterfalls mother nature also rewards leaders whose adaptive responses are the most thought through and coordinated she evolved her viruses to be expert at finding any weakness in your personal or communal immune system so if your family or community is not utterly coordinated in its response to her viruses they will find the tiniest cracks and make you pay also because mother nature is entirely made up of chemistry biology and physics she rewards only adaptation strategies grounded in those same raw materials if your adaptation strategy is grounded instead in ideology or election year politics she will mercilessly expose that and remember mother nature will not stop spreading this virus until either we come up with a vaccine to give us herd immunity or some 60 percent of us get the infection overcome it naturally and develop herd immunity that way but her viruses don t just magically disappear because of lockdowns it is true that the coronavirus hits different regions climates and populations differently and so each should be able to adapt a little differently but as university of minnesota epidemiologist michael osterholm recently told usa today over time this damn virus is going to keep going until it infects everybody it possibly can until it meets a vaccine or natural herd immunity for all these reasons it s clear or should be that the holy grail every nation needs to be looking for is what dr david katz a public health expert argued from the beginning of this crisis a sustainable strategy of total harm minimization that means a strategy that would save as many lives and as many livelihoods as possible at the same time we have to be trying our very best to do both and we can our choice never had to be accepting millions of deaths from the virus or from economic ruin said katz we could have and still can acknowledge that different members of our population face different risks from covid 19 and therefore develop strategies that protect the most vulnerable in our populations and let the least vulnerable return to work and thus achieve the best of both lock it down and open it up basically china germany south korea sweden and many others have all been pursuing different strategies for sustainably and maximally saving lives and livelihoods it is too soon to say that any of them has found the perfect strategy but what it s not too soon to say is that they are all reopening in ways that respect mother nature appreciate the need for coordination and are grounded in science so they re still requiring some degree of wearing of masks in public practicing social distancing restricting the number of people who gather in any enclosed space protecting the most vulnerable and limiting further spread by massive testing tracing and quarantining to contain inevitable new outbreaks until they get herd immunity america by contrast is a mess in some places you see reopenings that respect mother nature s power are coordinated and grounded in science and in other places you see crowded restaurants or a gym owner defying his governor s guidelines as cheering demonstrators waive signs that read my freedom doesn t end where your fear begins the people making those signs and the morons on fox cheering them on don t get it we re not up against each other we re all up against mother nature we need to reopen and we need to adapt but in ways that honor mother nature s logic not in ways that court a second wave not in ways that challenge mother nature to a duel that is not smart
