advertisement supported by ms warren a senator and former law professor staked her campaign on fighting corruption and changing the rules of the economy transcript i will not be running for president in 2020 but i guarantee i will stay in the fight for the hardworking folks across this country who have gotten the short end of the stick over and over that s been the fight of my life and it will continue to be so reporter will you be making an endorsement today we know that you spoke with both joe biden and bernie sanders yesterday not today not today i need some space around this and want to take a little time to think a little more this has been the honor of a lifetime ten years ago i was teaching a few blocks from here and talking about what was broken in america and ideas for how to fix it and pretty much nobody wanted to hear it and i ve had a chance to get out there and talk with millions of people gender in this race you know that is the trap question for every woman if you say yeah there was sexism in this race everyone says whiner and if you say no there was no sexism about a bazillion women think what planet do you live on by shane goldmacher and astead w herndon cambridge mass senator elizabeth warren entered the 2020 race with expansive plans to use the federal government to remake american society pressing to strip power and wealth from a moneyed class that she saw as fundamentally corrupting the country s economic and political order she exited on thursday after her avalanche of progressive policy proposals which briefly elevated her to front runner status last fall failed to attract a broader political coalition in a democratic party increasingly if not singularly focused on defeating president trump her departure means that a democratic field that began as the most diverse in american history and included six women is now essentially down to two white men former vice president joseph r biden jr and senator bernie sanders ms warren said that from the start she had been told there were only two true lanes in the 2020 contest a liberal one dominated by mr sanders 78 and a moderate one led by mr biden 77 i thought that wasn t right ms warren said in front of her house in cambridge as she suspended her campaign but evidently i was wrong though her vision energized many liberals the unlikely chant of big structural change rang out at her rallies it did not find a wide enough audience among the party s working class and diverse base now her potential endorsement is highly sought and both mr sanders and mr biden have spoken with her in the days since super tuesday losses sealed her political fate though she revealed precious little of her intentions on thursday i need some space around this she said ms warren s impact on the race was far greater than just the outcome for her own candidacy her policy plans drove the agenda she effectively pushed former mayor michael r bloomberg of new york a centrist billionaire out of the race with a dominant debate performance last month and her ability to raise well over 100 million and fully fund a presidential campaign without holding high dollar fund raisers demonstrated that other candidates beyond mr sanders and his intensely loyal small dollar donors could do so in the future transcript hello hello hey how are you buddy yikes what a day already um yeah what do you mean when you say what a day already well we just reported that elizabeth warren is dropping out of the presidential race we re here in boston outside of her house not in boston actually cambridge waiting for her to speak to a horde of media both local and national we have i understand that but i was here before you guys all jumped in front of me because we just found out we have to move from the new york times this is the field i m astead herndon in massachusetts around 12 30 on thursday senator elizabeth warren came out of a side door of her house with her husband and her golden retriever and addressed the media all right so i announced this morning that i am suspending my campaign for president i say this with a deep sense of gratitude it s been two days since super tuesday where elizabeth warren s best finish was in third place including in her home state of massachusetts that put her behind her campaign s already lowered expectations and made a gathering like today feel almost inevitable for every single person she thanks her supporters and her staff and takes questions senator will you be making an endorsement today we know that you spoke with both joe biden and bernie sanders yesterday not today not today i need some space around this and when it comes to why she has to drop out you know i was told at the beginning of this whole undertaking that there are two lanes a progressive lane that bernie sanders is the incumbent for and a moderate lane that joe biden is the incumbent for and there s no room for anyone else in this i thought that wasn t right but evidently i was wrong senator why do you think and on the question of gender and i wonder what the message would be to the women and girls who feel like we re left with two white men to decide between i know one of the hardest parts of this is all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years that s going to be hard senator why do you think she gets emotional but there are clearly things that she s left unsaid but when you ask her supporters who have come to the house to watch this speech they go there oh i m so sad yesterday i so sad i couldn t i couldn t move i m frustrated i m disappointed and sad i m heartbroken that very clearly most qualified candidate is out of the race sadly too many people in this country aren t ready for a woman president which is an unfortunate thing very disappointed but i guess there s never going to be a time for a woman she s my generation and we re not going to see it now this was our it s not going to happen crying grandma grandma i wanna go home maybe her generation all right we gotta go look at this little girl looking at the doggie she likes the doggie today millions of voters across six states will cast their ballot for the two viable democratic candidates left joe biden and bernie sanders what began as a contest with historic diversity along racial and gender lines has now come down to two men 70 plus both white and as someone who covered senator kamala harris and elizabeth warren and with warren especially who once led in national polling i m left to wonder how did we get here how did it end up this way wow oh those are one of the fancy doorbells where you can look at it with your phone hello how are you hello a party hi my name s astead i m a politics reporter at the times hi nice to meet you it s nice to meet you i m lyn what did you say your name is astead astead yes i m jessica so the next day me and producers austin mitchell and jessica cheung go to north andover massachusetts should we take our shoes off oh you don t have to you sure to meet with a pretty typical warren supporter lyn licciardello i only have one sock on it s fine laughter you have what i only have one sock on how does that happen her husband tom is there too tommy will you pour water please yes i knew there was a role for me somewhere and her cousin kathleen let me take your coats and we all sit down in their living room what do you do i am a nurse but i teach exercise now oh very nice give me what exercise oh well i teach a class that s about the first half is aerobic and then there s some stretching and strength training it s about an hour class at the senior center in lawrence awesome how long have you been in north andover since 1949 hm and when did you first notice senator warren i noticed senator warren years ago i think it was around 2012 i happened to be reading the paper one morning and i noticed that a congressman named todd akin had said a horrible thing about women and pregnancy saying that if a woman were to get pregnant as a result of rape then her body has a way of getting rid of that it seems to me first of all from what i understand from doctors that s really rare if it s a legitimate rape the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down and my eyes just flew open and i said oh my god this man is in our congress i was flabbergasted and i said to my husband who is that woman there was a at the same time i was not happy with scott brown who was our senator at the time he doesn t stand up for women s reproductive rights and economic security he co sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control or even mammograms he had two opportunities and i said who s that woman that s going to run against scott brown i heard that a woman is going to run against scott brown i m elizabeth warren i m running for the united states senate and before you hear a bunch of ridiculous attack ads i want to tell you who i am like a lot of you i came up the hard way and i said i have to do something to help her get elected but washington is still rigged for the big guys and that s gotta change i m elizabeth warren and i approve this message because i want massachusetts families to have a level playing field and so lyn becomes a volunteer for the warren senate campaign i was always on board with elizabeth right after that why do you think you felt so drawn to elizabeth warren because in many ways she s me she s me she has the same feelings that i have she s actually very close to my age she has a wonderful way of kind of looking into your heart and mind she s interested in you she s interested in the people hi i m elizabeth warren it s very nice to see you i m going to vote for you wonderful say that again fabulous we re here for the chicken laughter good to see you i like your shirt very handsome elizabeth has that heart and she s brilliant and despite the odds you elected the first woman senator to the state of massachusetts cheering how did it feel i mean she wins the race obviously how did that feel oh my god it was so exciting i still can t say that without crying it was so exciting so then in 2016 well i was for hillary hillary i was very invested in having hillary be president she had all the qualifications she was more qualified than anybody who s ever been president in my opinion but because she was a woman i knew it would be difficult but i still thought she could win did you know people or did you hear people say i won t vote for clinton because she s a woman not like that but here s what i did hear i was talking to a woman who was kind of a stranger but we were chatting and we were talking about politics and about how we feel about certain things so i guess it was like immigration climate change and things like that and this woman was on board with all of the democratic ideals and then i mentioned hillary clinton and she said oh i hate her and i said really because she s the one who stands for all of these things that we re talking about no no i can t stand her i said well why don t you like her oh i have no idea i said is it because she s an aggressive woman is she too aggressive is she too loud does she express herself too much and her reply was no i don t know why so like a minute later i mentioned elizabeth warren she said oh i can t stand her either so i was like she agrees with you about everything all the things that you re saying you believe in she is promoting no well i can t stand her so i know i mean i ve been a woman my whole life so i know very well that that is the reason even women will vote against women because they re women there are people out there who have this idea that you re not trustworthy that they don t like you for some reason what is that about in your opinion you know joy obviously i ve thought a lot about it because i don t like to hear it yeah so i need to figure out what s behind it you know i am perhaps a more serious person a more reserved person than is in the public arena these days so i think people then say well she s serious she s reserved can i really like her but what is inauthentic what s inauthentic mean i don t understand that i don t understand that because i ve been pretty much the same person my entire life for better or worse right mm hm clinton losing made a difference clinton losing did make it harder for me to think that a woman could win so this year when elizabeth warren announces that she s running lyn has mixed feelings i love that people were getting to know her all across the country hi hi my name s raelyn hi raelyn i was wondering if there was ever a time in your life where somebody you really looked up to maybe didn t accept you as much and how you dealt with that yeah my mother and i had very different views of how to build a future she wanted me to marry well and i really tried and it just didn t work out but i also know it was the right thing to do and sometimes you just gotta do what s right inside you gotta take care of yourself first and do this give me a hug applause and it was a pleasure for me to see that although i was a little bit worried in the wake of her third place finish in iowa and fourth place finish in new hampshire warren said my job is to persist but persisting and winning are two very different things senator elizabeth warren she came in fifth place in south carolina elizabeth warren trailing in fourth place in nevada i think the biggest question that elizabeth warren has to answer is where does she win lyn voted early in massachusetts for senator warren but in the days leading up to super tuesday she s questioning her vote and wondering if she did the right thing but i didn t feel i didn t feel bad that i had already voted for her at all because like she said vote with your heart and she was my heart did you know anyone personally in your life who were for warren and then jumped ship yes my cousin kathleen raising her hand yes actually as soon as buttigieg and klobuchar backed biden and i was kind of waiting to see how it all shook out a little bit i voted for biden because we have to stop sanders in my opinion but i would have voted for warren because i voted for hillary as kathleen is talking tom nods and raises his hand yeah did you raise your hand too me too yeah yeah yeah actually as the sole old white guy in the room i too did vote for biden though i love elizabeth warren and she would have made an extraordinarily wonderful president by the time massachusetts was voting if she looked more electable if she was a front runner you all would have stuck with her yeah you bet absolutely yeah did you see when she obviously when she comes out and talks at her house did you see that oh yes i was here in the living room i was in my own living room listening to it watching and yeah i cried through the whole thing it s heartbreaking do you remember something she said that day that stuck with you or maybe caused you to feel that emotion well one of the things was that you know how she talked about the pinkie swear that she does with the little kids the first time i met her which was way back when before she was elected senator for the first time she was doing that with little girls that were there what is the pinkie swear what is she promising girls she says that girls can be president she gets right down to their level she gets right down to their eye level and talks to the girls like that the race is now down to two guys after starting with such a diverse field gender ratio all of that how does it feel for it to be down to two men when you had four women senators at the start all of whom you liked i know it s sick isn t it chuckles you know it was almost inevitable i think people pan not panicked but i think that people are very very concerned that we have to beat trump but why does the feeling of need to beat trump then translate to men so you re saying i think a lot of people are scared i think a lot of people just want to beat trump and that s why it came down to two men what is necessarily male about those qualities because there are so many people in the country that just would not vote for a woman like that woman that i was talking about before and we really feel the need to prevail this time especially so the idea that a woman candidate is a risk because of other people s or the country s sexism yes that s how i feel it s a terrible thing to have to feel but i do feel that way right now i don t think it s always going to be like that but i think it s the way it is right now all right thank you you can go skiing now oh good i m sorry you can t come with us that was too bad tell us where you re going warren vermont laughs it s very funny because we have our ski place right next to our daughter and son in law in warren vermont and our son in law s parents live in warren rhode island a warren household to the end yes it s one voter s view that sexism is what consumed the elizabeth warren campaign and certainly that s one that s popular among her most die hard supporters but i m wondering is this the view inside her own campaign do they think that the barriers that gender placed on them were too big to overcome the same day we met with lyn we headed to the charlestown neighborhood of boston to elizabeth warren s campaign headquarters it s kind of like a warehousey building nondescript very on brand there is a dunkin donuts right across the street to meet with someone who s worked for the warren campaign from the start i m kristen orthman the communications director for elizabeth warren as communications director kristen s in charge of trying to best translate the candidate to the rest of the country particularly through the media and over the course of this campaign we got to know each other pretty well now that the campaign has ended i m wondering whether kristen will speak more candidly about what went wrong and about what role gender specifically played in the campaign s demise is there something different about planning communications and media for women politicians yes laughs yeah in what way i think that there can be more caution when you re working for a woman because you re viewing things through the lens of much more of how will this be perceived and i think i ve an appreciation for the challenges of the clinton presidential campaign probably now than i did when i first started in what way i think that the fact that there were stories when elizabeth first ran there was an infamous one like the day she announced this is december 31 2018 when warren first announced her intentions to seek the presidency talking about like i think it was the likability factor her versus hillary because they were two women who ran for president two white women who ran for president that had blond hair i mean i guess i m not quite sure what else warranted necessarily that so when it becomes clear she s running for president how forefront of mind was gender and the need to define her on her own outside of clinton or whatever terms i think when you re running for president male female you have to be yourself so what i was always and what our team and her always wanted to make sure is you are showing what you would hope is the truest version of yourself one of the critiques of the clinton campaign fair or not was that many voters felt like they never really knew her authentic self that there was a barrier between candidate and voter built up over all those years in the public eye so kristen and her team tried to go in the opposite direction to distinguish warren both from clinton but also from everyone else you know she runs out on stage hello indianola she dances cheering she stays for hours for photos so we just finished our event here in new york city and i got a lot of notes and a inaudible she is just like the compassionate and joyful person that i know behind the scenes was the person that was on a town hall stage or the fighter that i ve also seen behind the scenes and that many people saw whether in the hearing room or otherwise was the person on the debate stage there is a vulnerability that comes with that being a female candidate versus being a male candidate i always was thinking through the risks in that because i just knew that the mistakes that i m using quotes because i don t always they were but they were perceived as mistakes that female candidates make it s like a higher bar but to her these risks were necessary components of running an authentic campaign let s do the things that have now become like signatures were signatures of the campaign it s like well ok she s running for president to say something and do something so let s start doing that 2020 democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren is leading the pack when it comes to policy proposals so i ve got a plan for 3 2 million new housing units in america i ve got a plan to put 800 billion new federal into our public schools student loan debt i ve got a plan for that and corruption she became known as the i have a plan for that candidate the i have a plan for that just happened organically time magazine put it on the cover and that s when it became more of a thing i think it happened grassroots level before that people start talking about it because we were doing it there was like a whole meme section of like warren plan exactly that s what i mean yeah exactly exactly and by the end of last fall warren has crossed into front runner status she s leading in some national polls but this is also about the time that i noticed a shift in the race the primary change from a contest to ideas to one of just as obsession about who can win do you think that s true i think the primary campaign has always been about who can win how does that impact the women specifically who are running i do think i need distance in order to fully formulate but i don t think there s any question that electability was viewed through a lens that probably hurt the women candidates because there was a perception that after 2016 even though the female candidate got 3 million more votes is a woman not electable and she has said before publicly that she would hear that from people in the early states like i m worried about who can beat trump but i don t think all of a sudden in october it was like oh let s make this primary about who s going to beat donald trump that s what it s been i would largely agree certainly electability has never been far from mind for most democratic voters but as more and more people tuned into the race particularly around this time in the late fall it shifted its tone policy ideas took a back seat to that electability question and the candidates who had most clearly articulated their path to victory started to rise while elizabeth warren started to fall this coincided with rival candidates like pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar increasingly casting warren s campaign as out of touch with the mainstream democratic party and a real general election risk and so to respond to that scrutiny the warren campaign tries to reposition itself as a unity candidate someone who can actually bring all sides together there s sometime during the unity candidate phase where i did feel like it was different from the fight that we had heard before mm hm how do you square those two versions that we did see just this year i mean i think you can both unity doesn t mean not fighting i never didn t think she was herself take us into debate prep for instance like are you sitting there thinking we have to package a candidate and there are concerns about how she ll be perceived if she attacks too much or attacks too little like how much is gender a concern as you are thinking about the big national combative moments mm hm you know i don t want to make a big statement saying it s easier for men to attack than women i do think that there are probably greater consequences to a failed attack by a female than a failed attack by a male because obviously she had a debate performance a couple two debates ago where she doing some level of contrasts with mayor bloomgberg understatement of human history i d like to talk about who we re running against a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse faced lesbians and no i m not talking about donald trump i m talking about mayor bloomberg democrats are not going to she was really strong she was tough and she was dynamic democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another this country has worked they were contrasting with each other and i think overall it was agreed upon that she did well in that exchange but this came in nevada after two straight disappointing finishes in iowa and new hampshire i mean if we re just going to take nevada i feel like that is a reason to ask why then and not previously were you all in rooms saying well we can t attack yet one of things i remember from the second this campaign started was the way that supporters were so eager to see her cut down the bidens and the bernies and everyone else it really didn t get that payoff until nevada mm hm why so i like reject the premise of your question because i think that you can be both advocating for yourself and creating contrast in ways that are not that don t always need to be how it happened in nevada senator warren what did you think when senator sanders told you a woman could not win the election laughter i disagreed bernie is my friend and i am not here to try to fight with bernie but look now some would say about and this is what i heard frequently from reporters oh you guys are doing subtle contrasts people don t get that people don t know that i don t necessarily agree with that i think that you re always looking at the bar of how do we balance advocating for yourself and your ideas versus contrasting with other people you characterize warren as contrasting with bloomberg yes others might characterize that as she was attacking bloomberg or going after bloomberg yeah and i wonder yeah i wonder if in your role you re choosing your words carefully because you know that male politicians are treated differently or characterized differently than female politicians i very specifically used the word contrast so you are correct that i was specifically choosing those words that was your question right yeah there is a prevailing view from warren supporters that gender was the foremost reason that she wasn t successful in this race do you share that feeling you think that s a prevailing view yeah definitely i just think i probably need more time to think about it and i m not trying to not answer your question i think that there were what she said yesterday around like there were basically two ideological i think she called them poles we could call them lanes that s not necessarily genderized that is an ideological reason and then i think electability the idea of electability was the other reason now the idea of electability through the eyes of can a woman win certainly that s gender and i would add that it wasn t just can a woman win it was can a non white or non male candidate win for that last point it seems as if then this kind of place that we ve ended with two people on the ideological poles both of them being white males was that inevitable i mean maybe i don t know yeah we ll see you later bye we ll see you later it s so hard to get people i think this is true i mean particularly being a male reporter asking women about sexism you need people to like oh were you thinking about this then but that s not really how biases work right like does she say contrast and not attack because of sexism maybe but it s so deeply pervasive that it s not something you actively think about as you re doing it and i feel like that makes sometimes the reporting challenge difficult because you re asking these candidates like wasn t that sexist wasn t that racist wasn t that blah blah blah and it s like maybe i think there were a lot of challenges in the race and ideology was one name recognition is one fund raising is one and sexism and gender pervades all of those things and does it define all of those things maybe it informs all of those things is a better way to put it but you know how do you now gender in this race you know that is the trap question for every woman if you say yeah there was sexism in this race everyone says whiner and if you say no there was no sexism about a bazillion women think what planet do you live on i promise you this i will have a lot more to say on that subject later on senator advice to your supporters right now looking for a candidate what is your advice to them for an update on the economic fallout from the coronavirus which triggered historic declines in global financial markets on monday listen to the latest you can find it on the daily feed or by searching for the latest wherever you listen that s it for the daily i m michael barbaro see you tomorrow ms warren s political demise was a death by a thousand cuts not a dramatic implosion but a steady decline in the fall most national polls showed that ms warren was the national pacesetter in the democratic field by december she had fallen to the edge of the top tier wounded by an october debate during which her opponents relentlessly attacked her particularly on her embrace of medicare for all she invested heavily in the early states with a ground game that was the envy of her rivals but it did not pay off in iowa where she had bet much of her candidacy she had to take out a 3 million line of credit before the caucuses to ensure she could pay her bills in late january she wound up in a disappointing third place ms warren slid to fourth in new hampshire and nevada and to fifth in south carolina by super tuesday her campaign was effectively over with the final blow losing her home state massachusetts the california results strikingly laid bare the demographic cul de sac her candidacy had become as ms warren struggled to win over voters beyond college educated white people in particular white women she was poised to win delegates in only a handful of highly educated enclaves places like san francisco santa monica and west hollywood though the campaign failed to generate the widespread backing necessary to win the nomination ms warren retained a core of fierce loyalists dedicated to her promise of wholesale change her selfie lines were filled with well wishers young girls seeking her trademark pinkie promise i m running for president because that s what girls do cutouts of ms warren s likeness and tattoos of her adopted slogan nevertheless she persisted when her staff gathered thursday many were clad in liberty green the color her campaign adopted to symbolize its togetherness one of the hardest parts of this is all those pinkie promises a visibly emotional ms warren said describing the trap of gender for female candidates if you say yeah there was sexism in this race everyone says whiner ms warren said if you say no there was no sexism about a bazillion women think what planet do you live on before her exit ms warren accumulated the second largest number of democratic delegates of any woman to run for president in history behind only hillary clinton the 2016 nominee the party s left lane is now clearer for mr sanders his supporters and other progressives have spent the last two days gingerly reaching out to ms warren s orbit and plotting in private conversations about how to keep the two liberal standard bearers aligned in january mr sanders and ms warren clashed in a deeply personal way after she confirmed a report that in a private meeting before the campaign began he told her he believed that a woman could not win the white house in 2020 during a debate mr sanders strongly denied having made the remark and ms warren confronted him onstage afterward accusing him of calling her a liar relations have been chilly since in her call with mr biden ms warren revealed so little of her endorsement plans that a person familiar with the call remarked on her great poker face ms warren arrived on the political scene in the aftermath of the 2008 financial collapse and shot to stardom with her indictments of wall street and unfettered capitalism in 2016 some progressive organizations mounted run warren run campaigns and mr sanders floated her as a possible challenger to mrs clinton but ms warren declined to run joining the 2020 race she found a changed political terrain mr sanders s political stock had soared after his 2016 run giving him an immediate advantage in fund raising and name recognition that complicated ms warren s electoral path mr trump s election seemed to shock the democratic base into an acute focus on electability voters frequently second guessed their electoral choices as they tried to game out which candidate would be best equipped to beat him mr biden in particular has capitalized on this anxiety ms warren s allies and supporters said the electability question who would be the surest bet to defeat the president disproportionately hurt female candidates after mrs clinton s unexpected loss in 2016 all they heard all along was what a risk the women were said christina reynolds a vice president of emily s list a leading democratic women s group that endorsed ms warren this week only after senator amy klobuchar withdrew ms reynolds said that evaluation was as wrong as it was widespread the idea that that doesn t hang around the women s necks is crazy she said ms warren s campaign was slow to directly address questions of electability seeming to believe her rise in the polls last year spoke for itself but as the calendar turned to 2020 it was apparent that the issue was hobbling her candidacy as precinct captains and volunteers warned ms warren that it was what they were hearing about from voters ms warren s decline had begun in earnest at the october debate when she was pressed on how she would pay for medicare for alland had no answer it took weeks to detail her plan but by then her perceived trustworthiness seemed to have taken a hit the candidate with a plan for everything did not have one to finance the biggest issue of the campaign mr sanders despite releasing fewer details on paying for medicare for all has faced fewer questions when she did roll out details she was criticized by those on the left for compromising too much and by centrists for the sheer size of the plan the episode captured a fundamental pain point for her candidacy she was too much of an insider for those demanding revolution and too much of an outsider for those who wanted to tinker with the system and focus on beating mr trump as the race intensified in the fall ms warren was reluctant to strike back at her opponents even as they undermined her image pete buttigieg made deep incursions into her support among educated white voters but she did not call him out in earnest until december even as he flooded the iowa airwaves with a moderate message undercutting her progressive platform while most campaigns used the megaphone of mass television ads to cut through the media filter ms warren s braintrust was cool to the power of commercials from the start preferring on the ground and digital organizing at times ms warren s campaign did not reflect the urgency of a candidacy trying to make history and promote a program of systemic upheaval that included government run health care free public college student debt cancellation breaking up big tech universal child care and tax increases on the wealthy but after weak finishes in iowa and new hampshire ms warren charged into the february debate planning to confront mr bloomberg in his first appearance onstage in mr bloomberg she found a rare rival she seemed truly comfortable attacking an embodiment of the influence of money she slashed he stumbled mr bloomberg would never recover ms warren s donations surged but her vote count did not she would bend a principled stand that week as well declining to disavow a new super pac that would air nearly 15 million in pro warren advertising saying she did not want to unilaterally disarm the irony was not lost on her opponents the anti big money candidate wound up with the biggest super pac in the race to date in recent days ms warren had taken to speaking to voters directly about their electability fears imploring them to tune out pundits cast a vote from your heart she said tuesday in speeches over the course of her campaign ms warren sought to elevate the stories of women often women of color her final major address in east los angeles on monday was devoted to latina janitors who organized for better working conditions aimee allison the founder and president of she the people a political advocacy organization for women of color praised ms warren for her campaign s intentional inclusivity she really comes up as the first white candidate for president who had an intersectional politics she said but ms allison acknowledged that pitch did not find favor in the broader minority electorate even as it won plaudits from academics and activists black voters really were looking for a return to normalcy she said it was a rejection from what was perceived as riskier politics and a broader and more courageous political vision ms warren s supporters were devoted to making the party more progressive to the end in illinois where ms warren s campaign was scheduled to hold a post super tuesday phone banking session staff and supporters refused to cancel they used their time to support marie newman the local challenger running against an incumbent democrat opposed to abortion rights our work continues ms warren told her staff in the call informing them she was quitting the race the fight goes on and big dreams never die astead w herndon reported from cambridge and shane goldmacher from new york jonathan martin contributed reporting from new york updated may 25 2020 advertisement
