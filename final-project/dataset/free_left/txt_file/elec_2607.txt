advertisement supported by news analysis republicans want to cast president trump s impeachment as a narrow argument over aid to ukraine democrats want to describe it as part of a broader struggle with russia by david e sanger washington when secretary of state mike pompeo in a curse laden tirade to a reporter on friday asked do you think americans care about ukraine he was getting at an essential element of president trump s defense in the impeachment trial white house officials are convinced that americans are indifferent to what happens in the struggling former soviet republic and they may well be right but the impeachment trial is about more than the fate of ukraine and whether mr trump sold it out for a domestic political errand as his former adviser fiona hill put it so bitingly to democrats it s about a president who undercut his own administration s stated goal of pushing back hard against vladimir v putin s russia the geopolitical challenge of a new very different cold war it is one of those cases where the geography of the debate shapes the politics of the argument as long as the president s lawyers can focus the debate on the narrower question of ukraine they can argue that the charges against the president focus on a foreign policy sideshow how the president uses the spigot of american aid and attention to mold another country s behavior they basically said let s cancel an election over a meeting with the ukraine mr trump s white house counsel pat a cipollone said on saturday characterizing the democrats arguments as he opened the president s defense mr cipollone made the case that the democrats are seeking to undo mr trump s 2016 victory or fear that they cannot beat him in 2020 yet the defense team s characterizations about ukraine are also designed to make the impeachment charges appear to be on a fundamentally trivial affair surrounding the treatment of a faraway country that as mr pompeo suggests most people could not find on a map stripped of country names he challenged the npr reporter mary louise kelly to identify ukraine and she reported that she did that is precisely why the man leading the democrats prosecution of the case representative adam b schiff of california focused so relentlessly on russia last week mr schiff the chairman of the house intelligence committee understands that russia resonates in a way that ukraine never can his argument revives questions of whether mr putin has some strange still unexplained control over the american president which is why mr schiff played the cringe worthy tape of mr trump s news conference with mr putin in helsinki finland in summer 2018 in his public statements mr trump appeared to adopt the russian leader s self interested theory that someone else was behind the hacking of the democratic national committee s servers in the last presidential election it s a breathtaking success of russian intelligence mr schiff said this is the most incredible propaganda coup he continued because it s not just that the president of the united states standing next to vladimir putin is reading the kremlin talking points he won t read his own national security staff talking points cast that way this is no argument over american aid to kyiv new details of which emerged on sunday in an unpublished manuscript by john r bolton mr trump s former national security adviser instead the entire matter is part of a battle over russia s use of ukraine as a petri dish in disruption the place where mr putin has experimented with seizing territory undermining a hostile government and conducting cyberattacks that literally turned off the lights and it is an argument over mr putin s efforts to manipulate the 2020 election at a moment when even mr trump s own department of homeland security says the russians are already testing new techniques by demanding that the new president of ukraine investigate joseph r biden jr the former vice president and a political opponent of mr trump and reviving theories that the democratic national committee s server is somewhere in ukraine mr trump was essentially joining that manipulation effort mr schiff was saying the threat that he will continue to abuse his power and cause grave harm to the nation mr schiff said of the president is not hypothetical in less partisan times say when a presidential election does not loom mr schiff s argument might strike a political chord chiefly because it is the republicans who until recently have been particularly hawkish about mr putin s russia it is easy to forget now but when mr trump tried to water down sanctions on russia two years ago his own party pushed back so hard that new penalties for moscow passed 98 to 2 in one of the strange twists of history one of the two opposing votes was cast by senator bernie sanders the vermont independent who is a leading contender to take on mr trump in november in the house the measure passed 419 to 3 angry mr trump signed the bill knowing any veto would be overturned but the politics of impeachment are different than the politics of sanctions so it is no surprise that as the republicans focus on ukraine and the democrats focus on russia both are bending the facts to fit their case mr pompeo for example has been known to pause his episodic blasts at state department correspondents to make the legitimate point that it was the trump administration that gave powerful anti tank weapons called javelins to ukrainian forces a step that president barack obama refused the issue came up this weekend as jay sekulow accused the democrats of keeping that fact out of their 23 hours of arguments javelin missiles are serious weapons mr sekulow the president s personal lawyer reminded the senators at the trial on saturday he quoted the testimony of the two previous top american diplomats in ukraine including marie l yovanovitch who was recalled from her post last year in one of the events at the center of the impeachment charges the javelin decision is the best piece of evidence that the republicans have at hand that mr trump has been willing to stand up to mr putin almost everything else cuts the other way leaving little doubt that in twisting the arm of the new ukrainian government mr trump was not only pursuing his own political interests but also helping mr putin s even before he was elected mr trump wondered aloud why the united states was helping ukraine fight off the russians it made no sense he argued in a march 2016 interview on foreign policy his first extended discussion of his worldview as a candidate now i m all for ukraine i have friends that live in ukraine mr trump said during the interview at mar a lago his florida golf resort he complained that when the obama administration moved to impose sanctions on russia for its annexation of crimea and was getting very confrontational it didn t seem to me like anyone else cared other than us he added even their neighbors didn t seem to be talking about it and you know you look at germany you look at other countries and they didn t seem to be very much involved in fact they were very involved and continue to provide aid to ukraine to prop up its democracy and its economy while often complaining about rampant corruption but in the interview mr trump made no mention of corruption instead he lumped ukraine in with the many other examples he cited of nations that the united states supports while other countries freeload the release over the weekend of a recording of mr trump at a dinner in 2018 makes clear that the president understood early in his term that unless aid continued to ukraine it could be easily overrun how long would they last in a fight with russia mr trump asked at the dinner i don t think very long said lev parnas the soviet migr who worked for rudolph w giuliani in pressuring ukraine without us not very long what s missing from the record of mr trump s manipulation of the aid to ukraine last summer is any indication that he sought an assessment from the pentagon the intelligence agencies or his own national security council over whether suspending american help might in fact lead to the downfall of the ukrainian government and that in the end may be the most telling fact of all if nothing else what americans learned from watching the impeachment trial over the past week is that mr trump seemed to regard the conduct of foreign policy the way he has regarded any other policy a chess move toward re election rather than geopolitical advantage for the united states otherwise there would be conversations weighing the benefits of restricting aid against the harm to american interests in countering the power of russia there is anecdotal evidence that many around mr trump did in fact push back including mr pompeo defense secretary mark t esper and the c i a director gina haspel their arguments were ignored until a whistle blower s complaint made clear that the suspension of aid to ukraine was about to become public so far not one has testified as part of the impeachment process or spoken publicly about what they told mr trump about the potential consequences of his domestic political errand it is a silence that speaks as loudly as the arguments made in the senate updated may 25 2020 advertisement
