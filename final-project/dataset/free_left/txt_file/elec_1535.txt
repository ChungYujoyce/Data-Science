msnbc aired the fifth democratic presidential debate on feb 4 a showdown between former secretary of state hillary clinton and sen bernie sanders vt not every statement could be easily fact checked but followingis a list of 12 suspicious or interesting claims as is our practice we do not award pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates sanders is relying on an outdated statistic the numbers changed over the summer as sanders has sometimes acknowledged but in this debate he seems to have lapsed into an old talking point sanders is relying on the research of university of california at berkeley professor emmanuel saez who had once concludedthat the top 1 percent accumulated 91 percent of all income gains from 2009 12 but then when the numbers were updated in june for the period ending in 2014 the new calculations showed that the top 1 percent captured 58 percent of total real income growth the recovery from the great recession now looks less lopsided than in previous years saez said moreover there are limitations in saez s data which tallies wages taxable interest and dividends rental income and so forth social security and unemployment benefits are not counted neither are government transfer payments such as food stamps or veterans benefits the data also does not include noncash items such as employer provided health insurance lastly the impact of income and payroll taxes are not part of the calculations even though the rich pay most of the taxes and some lower income workers actually receive payments such as the earned income tax credit that offset all of their federal payroll and income taxes in other words the statistics show part of the income picture essentially the wages they do not necessarily show everything that americans receive to help them pay for the things they consume be it food stamps for the poor or company provided health insurance sanders exaggerates when he says he helped write the affordable care act he wrote only one amendment after he had to withdraw a proposal to create a medicare for all type single payer system the american health security act of 2009 introduced by sanders during the health care bill debate proposed a national health insurance system that would be administered by states and follow guidelines set on a federal level sanders s new health care system would have eliminated existing federal health insurance including medicare and medicaid and would repeal state exchanges as set up through the aca it would create a whole new health insurance system withnew quality control methods a new standards board and more that s why critics say he had proposed to dismantle the aca sanders withdrew that bill after sen tom coburn r okla initiated a procedural moverequiring the senate clerk to read all 767 pages of the amendment which would have taken eight to 10 hours and thereby halt the senate health care debate then sanders turned his attention to insertinga community health center provision into the aca as an alternative to his 2009 proposal this provision vastly increased health careaccess for low income and underserved communities increasing the number of patients who receiveprimary and dental care mental health counseling and low cost prescription drugs it also funded new centers and improvements to existing centers sanders s push for the community health centers helped convince some democratic lawmakers who believed the bill didn t go far enough to help rural states where such centers are vital health providers in the end sanders voted in support of the aca clinton has certainly been looking into it a long time the washington post has repeatedly asked the campaigntorelease copies of clinton s paid speeches most directly and pointedly for the last two weeks the post specifically made the requeston jan 23 and then again on jan 24 the request was renewed on feb 4 the morning of the msnbc debate other news organizations have asked for copies as well the silence has been deafening clinton tends to overstate the significance of her visit to wall street some months beforethe crash propublica obtained a video of the 28 minute speech and said she steered a middle ground to the business executives gathered at the nasdaq stock exchange on dec 5 2007 as propublica put it clinton said she would consider legislation if the voluntary proposals were not adopted but when her ideas were not accepted neither were her five proposed bills all but one had no co sponsors and no senate committee took action on them she played little role in a major housing bill that became law in 2008 and her bill to curb corporate compensation also went nowhere this is a very complex issue subject to fierce debate because companies generally do not disclose their tax liability but while some might escape paying federal income taxes these companies do pay all sorts of other taxes including property sales and employment taxes in 2012 general electric says the company paid 3 2 billion in income taxes worldwide including in the united states and paid more than 1 billion in other state local and federal taxes sanders touts his record as chairman of senate committee on veterans affairs leading the charge to pass the comprehensive reform bill to address wait time problems at the department of veterans affairs health system but he has faced criticism from veterans groups for not paying attention to the issue as soon as the scandal erupted in april 2014 in april 2014 whistle blowers revealed delays in accessing health care and manipulation of wait time data at the phoenix va health care system the allegations rocked the va and ultimately led to the resignation of then va secretary eric shinseki some veterans groups still point to sanders s comments the month following the revelation of problems in phoenix during a may 15 2014 hearing sanders said during an interview on cnn later that day sanders said did the delays in care of these people on the secret waiting list actually cause these deaths we don t know then republicans on the senate va committee wrote a letter urging sanders to hold more oversight hearings to hold va leaders accountable at the beginning of the 113th congress the minority staff provided your office with a number of possible oversight hearing topics on ongoing issues at the department of veterans affairs va the letter said to date none of the hearings we requested have occurred in fact during this congress the committee has held only seven oversight hearings which did not even begin to address the issues facing the department sanders ultimately worked with his counterparts in the house and republicans in the committee to work out a compromise va overhaul bill ah this line again we can count on clinton to repeat it whenever she talks about her wall street plan but as we have noted before she exaggerates the endorsements of her plan yes some experts have found her plan to be more comprehensive and effective than sanders s she s correct that krugman and frank have supported her proposal and frank actually advised her on drafting the plan but clinton and sanders have both gotten support from a range of phd economists former and current government officials and industry and think tank representatives who have endorsed one plan over the other s they both received criticism from a range of experts too this is a very unoriginal thought indeed it has been the dream of every american administration the hope is that china will push its client state to halt its nuclear ambitions but china always disappoints china views north korea as a useful buffer state between south korea moreover china insists it does not have the leverage over pyongyang that americans appear to believe maddow is referring to a recent sanders ad indeed titled endorsement which implies that two new hampshire news outlets the nashua telegraph and the valley news endorsed him in the democratic primary the outlets have not endorsed a democratic presidential candidate the sanders campaign edited the ad after fact checkers pointed it out here s a link to the original ad a narrator says in the ad from postal workers to nurses he s been endorsed for real change then the words endorsed by flash next to two organizations that endorsed sanders then the words endorsed by disappear next to the nashua telegraph s quote which reads he is not beholden to wall street money the words endorsed by appear again when the last outlet s name the valley news is flashed along with the quote sanders has been genuinely outraged about the treatment of ordinary americans for as long as we can remember the problem the nashua telegraph and the valley news did not endorse sanders in fact neither outlet has endorsed a democrat in the primary as our friends at politifact and factcheck org found the quote by the nashua telegraph was pulled from a may 2015 editorial praising sanders the quote by the valley news was from a december 2014 editorial encouraging sanders to enter the race sanders said in the debate that the campaign never said that somebody a newspaper endorsed us that did not that s not correct the first version of the ad did say sanders was endorsed by the valley news the words endorsed by was later removed but the ad still implies that all four organizations cited in the ad have endorsed sanders after all the ad is about endorsements clinton is being disingenuous when she claimed that she had hope that the final deal would be good she had been such a cheerleader of the agreement that cnn counted 45 times when she had touted the deal before she opposed it this tpp sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free transparent fair trade the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field clintonsaid in australia in 2012 and when negotiated this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world s total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment interestingly president obama proposed to eliminate the commerce department and the small business administration and replace them with a more agile agency to handle trade issues in 2012 he proposed to create what he called a secretary of business but the idea went nowhere the fact checker recently did a deep dive into the issues surrounding clinton s private email server in particular how top secret information could have ended up in an unclassified email system the subject is more complex than just retroactive reclassification intelligence officials believe the state department has been sloppy in the way it handles sensitive information in that a determination is made only after a document is requested for public release under the freedom of information act foia
