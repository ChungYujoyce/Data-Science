on friday hillary clinton made a bizarre claim about ronald and nancy reagan during the former first lady s funeral that on hiv aids they started a national conversation when before nobody would talk about it nobody wanted to do anything about it this got the history as we now know it completely wrong through documents and reviews of the time period we know the reagan administration did not care much about hiv aids until years into the epidemic in large part because it was perceived as a disease that only afflicted gay people in a particularly brazen example reagan s press secretary joked and laughed about hiv and its victims in press conferences so it came as little surprise when clinton walked back her comment in a statement later in the day while the reagans were strong advocates for stem cell research and finding a cure for alzheimer s disease i misspoke about their record on hiv and aids for that i m sorry but there s some reason to believe clinton meant what she said she was part of a democratic establishment in the 1980s that was by and large as out of touch with the plight of hiv aids and lgbtq people as the reagan administration was at the time so it s wholly plausible that her recollection of the period genuinely reflected well on the reagans at least on this issue garance franke ruta who was anhiv aids activist during the height of the epidemic explained in a great series of tweets 1 belatedly i don t doubt for a second that what clinton said about the reagans aids is how she remembers things being in in the 80s 90s 2 today all the different communities in america sit cheek by jowl on social online media in the 80s they were separated by vast chasms 3 there was a mainstream and then there were the margins and the margins were much more distant from the center than they are today 4 what clinton said perfectly encapsulated the viewpoint of mainstream democrats in the 1980s before the party became gay friendly 5 gay people had no party on their side no one to represent or speak for them fr halls of power act up protested democrats continually 6 when bill clinton famously said i feel your pain he said it to bob rafsky of act up who was heckling him https t co ahkczjmbi4 7 the times headline was heckler stirs clinton anger 8 the view from the other side is encapsulated by contemporaneous imagery such as this donald moffett from 1987 pic twitter com d8crfulcrj 9 or this 1987 silence death project poster pic twitter com qeirao9ywe 10 the old anti gay laws were still on the books upheld by bowers v hardwick in 1986 11 between aids panic and that ruling homophobia in america ratcheted up in the late 80s see pic twitter com xxqvkgaetx 12 so view fr other side is a community of people scotus said criminal facing a fatal disease unrepresented by any political party 13 today we talk endlessly on tv social about every minor controversial thing but in 80s 40k people died the president said nothing 14 today we are all more visible to each other imagine 40k people in america dying in 21st c w o president talking about it impossible 15 michael bronksi on the reagans https t co hyvnxtbgam pic twitter com 6ygemthx6l 16 the millennial view these horrifying white house transcripts show how america used to think about aids https t co gi88yqtzzs 17 all of which is to explain why clinton s comments today raised such ire based on these facts it s easy to imagine how someone in the political establishment like clinton could remember a very different version of the reagans history on hiv aids for lgbtq people and people with hiv at the time it was a very different and frankly worse world at the height of the epidemic and the establishment that clinton was part of reflected that get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
