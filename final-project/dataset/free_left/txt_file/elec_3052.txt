been absent hillary clinton s john d podesta mrs clinton s campaign chairman broke the silence on her behalf demanding the declassification of all information about russia s meddling as well as an explanation from the obama administration of what it knew and when it knew it we now know that the c i a has determined russia s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing donald trump mr podesta wrote in a statement this should distress every american never before in the history of our republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy this is not a partisan issue and we are glad to see bipartisan support in the congress for an investigation into russia s role he continued we believe that the administration owes it to the american people to explain what it knows regarding the extent and manner of russia s interference and this be done as soon as possible to that end we also support the request from members of the senate intelligence committee to declassify information around russia s roles in the election and to make this data available to the public thrown on the defensive josh earnest the white house press secretary said on monday that the white house did not announce a major probe of russia s interference before the election partly because many voters would have seen such an announcement as political meddling he said russia did not hack the electoral process or the counting of votes but what is also clear is that the results of the hack and leak effort carried out on the orders of russia were extensively discussed prior to the election mr earnest said with evidence mounting that russian intelligence promoted his election the president elect continued his denial via twitter that second post is a head scratcher the united states government formally accused russia of trying to sow discord in the democratic process through its hacking in early october it stopped short of saying the goal was to elect mr trump and forensic analysis does allow experts to trace the source of a hack oh and fresh off his shot at boeing over the cost of an air force one upgrade mr trump took a jab at another expensive military program the f 35 stealth fighter on that one he will have bipartisan support just not in congressional districts where the fighter is built transcript the russians have interfered in a lot of other elections the russians have hacked into some of our most secret military information the russians have been active using as a tool as part of vladimir putin s ambition to regain russian prominence and dominance in some parts of the world vladimir putin is a thug and a murderer and a killer and a kgb agent he had boris nemtsov murdered in the shadow of the kremlin he has dismembered the ukraine he has now precision strikes by russian aircraft on hospitals in aleppo mr mccain said on monday that there was no doubt about the hacking by russian intelligence services into democratic campaign accounts which he called another form of warfare appearing on cbs this morning with senator chuck schumer of new york the next minority leader mr mccain said the wide ranging investigation of russian meddling in the election would include his committee as well as the foreign relations and intelligence committees he said a senate investigation would be necessary despite president obama having already ordered up an inquiry as that one would not be completed before the end of the obama administration the implication was that the new trump administration would not follow through we don t want to point a finger and i don t want this to turn into the benghazi investigation mr schumer added referring to the house investigation into the attacks on an american compound in libya which he said had been partisan this is serious stuff one week before the electoral college meets to ratify mr trump s election victory 10 electors including a texas republican who has turned on mr trump and christine pelosi the daughter of representative nancy pelosi have demanded their own intelligence briefing on russian efforts to elect mr trump we intend to discharge our duties as electors by ensuring that we select a candidate for president who as our founding fathers envisioned would be endowed with the requisite qualifications as electors we also believe that deliberation is at the heart of democracy itself not an empty or formalistic task we do not understand our sole function to be to convene in mid december several weeks after election day and summarily cast our votes their request the electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between donald trump his campaign or associates and russian government interference in the election the scope of those investigations how far those investigations may have reached and who was involved in those investigations we further require a briefing on all investigative findings as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether mr trump is fit to serve as president of the united states additionally the electors will separately require from donald trump conclusive evidence that he and his staff and advisers did not accept russian interference or otherwise collaborate during the campaign and conclusive disavowal and repudiation of such collaboration and interference going forward ms fiorina the former hewlett packard chief executive emerged from a meeting with the president elect at trump tower on monday to talk tough not on russia but on china which she called our most important adversary and a rising adversary ms fiorina was called in to discuss the job of director of national intelligence a senior transition official said and ms fiorina once a bitter foe of mr trump s was effusive we talked about hacking whether it s chinese hacking or purported russian hacking she said we talked about the opportunity that the president elect has to literally reset things to reset the trajectory of this economy to reset the role of government to reset america s role in the world and how we re perceived in the world and i think it s why he s getting such fantastic people in his administration mr trump and ms fiorina clashed bitterly when she ran against him for the republican nomination mr trump denigrated her appearance last year in an interview with rolling stone saying look at that face ms fiorina briefly agreed to be senator ted cruz s vice presidential running mate before he too was vanquished by the eventual nominee all appears to be forgiven first i want to say he has really cool stuff in his office she said all of these athletes have given him all this incredible memorabilia i was particular taken by shaq o neal s shoe which is huge i guess it takes a champion to know a champion three days ago an image calling for the extermination of muslims was posted on former representative allen west s facebook page the outrage prompted an aide to mr west a former army lieutenant colonel to claim credit and take the image down message to our followers hello everyone this is michele hickford editor in chief of allenbwest com last night i posted a meme without col west s knowledge or consent which was inappropriate and crossed the line i take full responsibility for this it was wrong i was wrong it does not reflect col west s beliefs i michele hickford personally apologize for any offense caused and especially to col west to whom i apologize for adversely affecting his reputation principles and values the outrage wasn t too great to deny mr west another audience with the president elect on monday at trump tower nor was it enough to prompt a question from the reporters in the trump tower lobby though they did ask mr west about russian efforts to elect mr trump president reporters should there be a bipartisan investigation of russia hacking mr west i think there are more important things we re about to see a collapse in syria iraq is falling apart the iran nuclear deal is horrific china and russia are expanding i think that s where we need to focus your intelligence efforts the trump transition team officially named gary d cohn the longtime president and chief operating officer of goldman sachs to be the director of the white house national economic council after a campaign full of attacks on wall street and goldman sachs in particular mr trump will have goldman s no 2 in the west wing and a former goldman partner steven mnuchin next door at treasury if he is confirmed but the transition team tried to find something inspirational in the latest multimillionaire in addition to his incredible business history mr cohn has an inspiring personal story growing up in shaker heights ohio he was diagnosed at age 7 with dyslexia that is one of the rare moments where shaker heights an affluent suburb of cleveland is mined for inspirational struggle mr trump is looking at appointing a rising republican star from south dakota representative kristi noem as his secretary of agriculture a senior official working on the transition said monday the transition team is vetting ms noem now and she is scheduled to meet with mr trump this week ms noem 45 would be one of the younger members of mr trump s cabinet a group that so far consists mostly of older men she has been planning to leave congress at the end of her next term in 2018 to run for governor of south dakota another name floated for the agriculture job senator heidi heitkamp of north dakota is being considered for a variety of jobs including energy secretary because she is a democrat and would likely be replaced in the senate by a republican the transition official said she could essentially have whatever job she wants speaking of roles the former texas governor rick perry who wanted to eliminate the department of energy but could not remember its name on live television has emerged as a leading candidate for energy secretary although texas is rich in energy and mr perry is big on extracting it he cannot afford too many oops moments if he is named to that post the energy department s primary role is to design nuclear weapons and ensure the safety and reliability of the nation s aging nuclear arsenal through a constellation of scientific laboratories the two men who served as president obama s energy secretaries were scientists one with a nobel prize the other from the massachusetts institute of technology mr trump is also looking at two other possibilities for energy secretary he likes senators joe manchin iii of west virginia and heidi heitkamp of north dakota both democrats for the job both are under tremendous pressure from fellow democrats not to accept a cabinet job advertisement
