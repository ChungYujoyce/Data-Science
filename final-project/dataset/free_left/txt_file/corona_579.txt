advertisement supported by more than six weeks after the first coronavirus deaths in a nursing home outbreaks unfold across the country about a fifth of u s virus deaths are linked to nursing facilities by farah stockman matt richtel danielle ivory and mitch smith the first warning of the devastation that the coronavirus could wreak inside american nursing homes came in late february when residents of a facility in suburban seattle perished one by one as families waited helplessly outside in the ensuing six weeks large and shockingly lethal outbreaks have continued to ravage nursing homes across the nation undeterred by urgent new safety requirements now a nationwide tally by the new york times has found the number of people living in or connected to nursing homes who have died of the coronavirus to be at least 7 000 far higher than previously known in new jersey 17 bodies piled up in a nursing home morgue and more than a quarter of a virginia home s residents have died at least 24 people at a facility in maryland have died more than 100 residents and workers have been infected at another in kansas and people have died in centers for military veterans in florida nevada new york maine massachusetts oregon and washington on friday new york officials for the first time disclosed the names of 72 long term care facilities that have had five or more deaths including the cobble hill health center in brooklyn where 55 people have died at least 14 nursing homes in new york city and its suburbs have recorded more than 25 coronavirus related deaths in new jersey officials revealed that infections have broken out in 394 long term facilities almost two thirds of the state s homes and that more than 1 500 deaths were tied to nursing facilities overall about a fifth of deaths from the virus in the united states have been tied to nursing homes or other long term care facilities the times review of cases shows and more than 36 500 residents and employees across the nation have contracted it in interviews with more than two dozen workers in long term care facilities as well as family members of residents and health care experts a portrait emerged of a system unequipped to handle the onslaught and disintegrating further amid the growing crisis they re death pits said betsy mccaughey a former lieutenant governor of new york who founded the committee to reduce infection deaths an education campaign aimed at stopping hospital acquired infections these nursing homes are already overwhelmed they re crowded and they re understaffed one covid positive patient in a nursing home produces carnage transcript you may have just that one patient with the coronavirus that come into your facility and you don t know i can go to work today wind up feeding them and then find out two hours later oh they have that virus and i ve already been exposed nursing assistants cna s we re the closest ones we re the front line the work of nursing assistants has always been difficult and low paying but add coronavirus and it s become dangerous tv announcers across the country nursing homes are especially vulnerable one elder care facility where 19 residents have died in palo alto in the new orleans area in dupage county in sacramento county covid 19 spreading through our most vulnerable population we met up with caregivers from nursing homes in northern california they attend to the kind of patients who are most likely to die if they get the virus so can you do your job without touching people or without it s impossible everything is touch bathing feeding assist them to the restroom brushing their teeth turning it s almost like a holding and cleaning at the same time helping nurses with wound care cleaning their ears tying their shoes we do everything well you could be feeding that patient or you could be doing something and the patient starts coughing it s too late to turn around you already done got crap all over you you know you just run to the bathroom wash your face or whatever and then go about your day social distance can t do it it s impossible if this video were filmed at a different time you d be seeing footage of these workers with their patients but nursing homes are closed to visitors right now to protect the people inside actually everything you re seeing here we filmed from afar following recommendations to slow the spread of covid 19 but these caregivers can t maintain that kind of distance in their work and now shortages of protective gear like masks are putting them at risk not just for getting the virus but for spreading it if you want to speak press star 6 we re running out of supplies of masks in our building and trying to take care of these patients without us also getting sick is worrisome we re rationing right now masks protective gear but it s like what happens if we run out it scares me they gave us the n95 mask and told us to maintain it if the elastic comes off by accident or something staple and reuse it so you re actually cleaning the n95 masks in between uses yeah with with alcohol you like wipe off the outside of it or how do you do that the outside the inside and just let it air dry and put it back in a ziploc bag for the next day a lot of people in this field we have families so you don t want to take nothing home my granddaughter she s special needs so she has a low immune system when she was born she was really sick so we ve been cautious ever since she s been born i am very concerned of taking it home my mom she s diabetic and my dad also just beat cancer in the thyroid i have asthma so if i were to get covid it would affect my lungs and how am i going to pay my bills because it s paycheck to paycheck what i m doing the pay for this work is low in the u s the median salary is less than 30 000 a year as a result many nursing assistants work multiple jobs and as they move between facilities so can disease usually when i finish the first job i go right to the second job i work 16 hours that s not including driving time and i m not the only one majority of my co workers they work two jobs i work home health care too on top of taking care of my mom and my grandmother i m kind of worried because you don t see the virus because they re droplets and you don t know who s coughing or sneezing on you even though i do try to sanitize like along the way going to my next client but sometimes it s just not enough i think but who else is going to take care of them it is a tragedy that is continuing to unfold and one that even the dire figures that are known only partially capture the number of cases at these facilities which include nursing homes assisted living facilities memory care facilities retirement and senior communities and long term rehabilitation facilities is almost certainly still higher since many facilities counties and states have not provided detailed information the outbreaks have been spread across the sprawling senior care industry including at publicly run facilities those run by nonprofit groups and others managed by large corporations some nursing homes with clusters have a history of safety violations persistent staffing problems and limited amenities other hard hit facilities have sterling health records luxurious living arrangements and pricey rents the virus is known to be more deadly to aging immune compromised people and small confined settings like nursing homes where workers frequently move from one room to the next are particularly vulnerable to spreading infection but oversights and failures also have contributed to the crisis virus tests and protective gear have been scarce inside many of these facilities which are among the most overlooked players in the health care system these homes with staff members who receive less extensive training than those in hospitals tend to struggle to slow infectious diseases employees are often poorly paid workers who move between multiple jobs and return home to communities at risk of contracting the virus all of these factors have allowed the virus to thrive making its way into at least 4 100 american nursing homes and other long term care facilities despite increasingly desperate efforts to stop the spread facilities were late to require workers and residents to wear masks and some were still not enforcing such policies workers and family members said facing shortages of tests and of masks homes often waited they said until residents were showing symptoms of covid 19 before testing them for the virus and isolating them from others even if they had contact with people who had been infected the residents and staff are being led to slaughter said judith regan an editor and publishing executive whose 91 year old father leo regan lives at the long island state veterans home at stony brook university at least 57 residents and 37 staff members there have tested positive for the virus and 32 residents have died he is on the titanic but there are no lifeboats ms regan said officials at the veterans home did not respond to requests for comment employees at some facilities have stopped coming to work in california 83 patients with the virus had to be evacuated from a nursing facility in riverside county after only one of 13 scheduled certified nursing assistants appeared at work public health officials said sixteen employees and dozens of patients had tested positive days earlier even now protective gear is in short supply at many homes one nursing assistant at a detroit nursing facility said she had been issued an n95 mask but had to make it last three weeks with no gowns available she said she and her co workers were being told to suit up in the same gowns that patients sleep in in miami rosa mercedes a certified nursing assistant at a residential facility waited in line in her car for a coronavirus test on thursday at the hard rock stadium she said her facility which she declined to name provides her with one mask each day as she feeds bathes and helps multiple patients use the bathroom now she has a cough and sore throat i don t know if i have it or don t have it she said everybody s living in a nightmare nursing home industry officials acknowledged this week that many of their facilities were in crisis and said they lacked the protective equipment and testing that hospitals have received we don t have what we need to stop this said mark parkinson the president and chief executive of the american health care association and the national center for assisted living a trade organization that represents skilled nursing facilities and assisted living homes that house more than a million people we have got to have masks and we don t have masks mr parkinson said that federal health authorities have designated nursing homes and long term care facilities at a lower priority level than hospitals meaning longer turnaround times for test results a significant problem for slowing spread he said that many employees do not have the option of isolating themselves from sick patients the cavalry hasn t arrived mr parkinson said people will end up blaming nursing homes and talking about how terrible we are but it is the complete lack of prioritization that has put us in the position that we are in nursing home facilities have borne the brunt of a structural shift hospitals seeking to keep costs down send more vulnerable patients into a growing industry of nursing homes even before the pandemic 380 000 people died each year from infection at long term care facilities according to the centers for disease control prevention the centers for medicare and medicaid services which regulates the nation s more than 15 000 nursing homes issued new guidance last month telling administrators to restrict all visitors cancel group activities shut down dining rooms and screen all residents and staff members for fevers and respiratory illnesses families of nursing home residents said some of the new restrictions were enforced unevenly in some homes unlocked front doors in some places for instance have failed to stop visits and even where enforcement has been strict staff members could still unwittingly carry the virus inside at canterbury rehabilitation and healthcare center in richmond va where many residents rely on medicaid to cover costs triple rooms are not uncommon the facility has struggled to hire and retain nursing staff as recently as october federal investigators found nearly two dozen deficiencies at the facility including a lack of appropriate respiratory care for a resident and a lack of appropriate ulcer care when a few cases of the virus cropped up at canterbury in mid march the state had only a few hundred test kits available limiting officials ability to figure out how far it had spread according to dr danny avula the local county s health official by the time officials were able to test everyone a few weeks later more than 60 residents tested positive including some who did not show symptoms at least 46 of the facility s estimated 160 residents have died from the virus making it one of the deadliest clusters in the country updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities nursing homes were not designed to deal with this kind of crisis dr avula said even in the best of times the facilities struggle to retain staff and families of residents of some facilities heaped praise on staff members for risking their own lives to keep working the situation has led anxious families to agonize about whether to try to bring their loved ones home but many cannot provide the extensive medical care that is required and fear exposing others to the virus as they wrestle with what to do many say that they are being given little information about what is happening inside the homes it s totally horrifying i can t even describe the feeling said adam zimmerman whose 77 year old mother lives in an acute care facility near los angeles where cases of the virus have been identified he said he speaks by phone regularly with his mother who has a tracheotomy and medical conditions but has not been able to visit her in weeks at a facility in new york city there had been no indication of a problem a grandson of a resident said until last week when he received a call that his grandfather who has alzheimer s was gravely ill he was coughing hard and had a fever by sunday he was dead only later was the family told that the man had tested positive for the coronavirus according to the grandson who wanted to be identified only by his first name andrew because his grandmother is still in the nursing home and has yet to be told of her husband s death she too has tested positive for the virus he said he said it broke his heart that his grandfather died alone i couldn t even hold his hand he said he couldn t speak english and he was just surrounded by strangers i can t imagine how scared he must have been some facilities have found creative ways to combat the virus at the park springs life plan community in stone mountain ga four staff members and one resident have tested positive for the virus but they have fully recovered the facility decided to take a rare step it asked staff members to volunteer to live on the campus to avoid inadvertently carrying the virus into the facility from home sixty workers volunteered ginger hansborough the facility s accounting director who normally lives with a partner and his octogenarian mother moved in not only to protect residents at the facility but also to protect her family i didn t want to be the reason that anything happened to them she said
