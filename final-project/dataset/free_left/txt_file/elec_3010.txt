chris christie depicts marco rubio as a truant schoolboy jeb bush s top ally portrays him as a weather vane ted cruz and his supporters characterize him as a nervous sellout who bowed to democratic demands for amnesty in commercials interviews and face to face meetings with voters rubio s 2016 rivals and their backers are waging increasingly personal attacks using different words to say much the same thing that the freshman senator from florida is weak and unreliable with their pointed attacks rubio s rivals have essentially taken a page out of donald trump s playbook after months of trying and failing to dislodge the brash gop front runner the field is now focused heavily on rubio who is seen as a vulnerable and necessary target straddling the line between the conservative and establishment wings of the republican party thursday night s fox business news debate in north charleston s c will put the new dynamic on display before a national audience with less than three weeks to go until the iowa caucuses rubio advisers and allies are tight lipped about his debate strategy but in general they say that he will not endure attacks quietly rubio tends to respond to criticism with specific well rehearsed policy critiques rather than personal jabs however in a campaign where trump christie and cruz have ascended on the strength of their belligerent dispositions and quippy broadsides rubio s softer approach carries risks he s not as inflammatory as others and those personal attacks tend to get headlines said rep jason chaffetz r utah a rubio supporter but marco rubio is that steady responsible conservative with a message that s inspirational for a lot of us marco rubio is a man in a hurry one of the most searing attacks on rubio yet came this week in the form of a web video from keep the promise i a super pac supporting cruz the 1 1 2 minute spot splices together footage of president obama praising the immigration reform bill rubio once pushed and clips from interviews edited to give rubio a deer in the headlights look to many republicans rubio s youth is one of his best attributes the 44 year old candidate regularly talks about hip hop electronic dance music uber and airbnb he looks sounds and sometimes dresses younger than most republican officials but where some see an appealing freshness others see inexperience and weakness critiques similar to those leveled at barack obama by republicans in 2008 marco rubio has never run anything i m not sure he could run a bath said roger stone a longtime trump confidant who departed trump s political team last year right to rise usa a super pac supporting former florida governor jeb bush put out a video this week that kicked off a multi pronged attack against rubio including seemingly questioning his masculinity and accusing him of changing his position on cap and trade regulations immigration and other issues these boots are made for flippin and that s just what they ll do one of these days young marco s gonna flip flop flip on you sings a woman in the video which makes fun of rubio s well documented fashion choice during a recent swing through new hampshire a pair of stylish black high heeled boots right to rise also released a tv ad showing a rubio cutout spinning around on a weather vane in a wednesday interview with msnbc bush who at 6 3 is at least five inches taller than rubio was asked whether he owned any platform boots i don t have a height issue he said strategic or overconfident rubio plays hard to get with voters trump who also has a height advantage said last week on a boston radio station that it helps to be tall i don t know what to think of those boots he said adding they re big heels i mean those heels are really up there rubio has called the fascination with his boots craziness at a time when consequential events are unfolding across the world for most of rubio s competitors finishing ahead of him rather than trump is a more realistic goal in the early states it s particularly critical for those stuck in the middle tier to receive a boost with donors and voters in the first wave of contests christie new jersey s governor is a good example since the last debate in december the rubio christie rift has deepened christie has said in recent interviews with the washington post and other news outlets that rubio turns tail and runs a reference to him walking away from comprehensive immigration reform that the truant officer is out looking for him a reference to his many senate absences and perhaps his relative youth and that democratic candidate hillary clinton would cut his heart out rubio and his campaign have hit back but on policy rather than character i m sure he doesn t really want to have a conversation about the issues rubio said of christie in nashua n h last week rubio dinged the new jersey governor as a backer of common core education standards said he ran for office as a supporter of gun control and noted that christie once made a contribution to planned parenthood days earlier a pro rubio super pac unveiled a tv ad campaign in new hampshire with similar lines of attack he s cuban i m mexican can rubio and cruz connect with latino voters on monday rubio delivered a speech on taxes in which he took policy swipes at christie and cruz in a clear shot at the senator from texas rubio said not to be fooled by advocates of a business flat tax which he said acts like a value added tax widespread in foreign countries but not the united states much of cruz s anti rubio rhetoric has been associated with his membership in the bipartisan gang of eight that pushed a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 the bill included a path to citizenship that conservative opponents call amnesty rubio has fought back against cruz by pointing to an amendment cruz pushed offering legal status to undocumented immigrants cruz says it was a poison pill meant to foil democrats rubio has also sought to run to cruz s right on national security hitting him hard over his vote to stop the government s bulk collection of americans telephone metadata recent polling shows rubio edging up to second or third place in each of the first two nominating states there s a growing sentiment that party elites will eventually coalesce around an alternative to trump and cruz who some leading republicans fear are too combative for the general election rubio is trying fend off christie bush and ohio gov john kasich in that sub contest can optimist candidate marco rubio win as a pessimist even as he stresses his youth and next generation appeal rubio has tried to appear presidential as his rivals raise doubts about him he is pitching himself as the strongest possible commander in chief his events even the small ones have a formal feel to them with a stage always erected at the front his tv ads include several spots with dark themes and dire warnings about threats overseas rubio will have to adjust a bit to thursday s debate because rand paul a natural opponent on foreign policy did not poll well enough to appear on the main stage in the last debate rubio took am at the kentucky senator s libertarian leaning foreign policy to tout his more hawkish views rubio has tended to do well in the debates winning positive reviews in each of the previous five meetings after the debate rubio will hit the campaign trail in new hampshire and then iowa where some like evan sinclair 20 are nervously watching whether he can blunt his rivals attacks observing rubio shake hands in the des moines suburbs recently sinclair said he hopes the senator can catch fire rubio had better shine a light so the republican party can exist he said people need to wake up and see a rational candidate is needed
