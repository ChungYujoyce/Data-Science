the presumptive democratic nominee just before voters went to the polls the california results still matter a bernie sanders victory here could fuel his case for taking his fight to the party convention in july and in the nation s largest state the battle likely comes down to heavily populated highly diverse los angeles advertisement clinton and sanders respective paths through all of the states voting on tuesday california montana new jersey new mexico north dakota and south dakota include concentrations of white voters black voters latinos asians urban centers some of the nation s

in the new york and philadelphia suburbs along with smaller cities like newark and camden 2016 by gabriel debenedetti the political geography of tuesday s primaries and caucuses also takes the race to places that because of the typically late voting dates are often inconsequential but occasionally decisive but these states haven t always voted late california moved up its primary to super tuesday starting in 1996 and when hillary clinton defeated barack obama there eight years ago the hard fought primary was held on feb 5 the primary was slotted back to june in 2012 when obama was the only democratic candidate on the ballot along with other states in which democrats will head to the polls on tuesday including new jersey and new mexico the early june date holds great historical significance then sen robert kennedy won the june 4 1968 california primary but was shot and killed leaving the los angeles hotel ballroom where he had celebrated his victory triumphs by george mcgovern on june 6 1972 in new mexico and winner take all california helped him polish off sen hubert humphrey d minn gary hart was an extreme underdog to win the nomination heading into the states that voted on june 5 1984 and even though the colorado senator won primaries that day in california and new mexico democrats in new jersey chose walter mondale after hart took a few offhand rhetorical digs at the garden state delegates remaining 56 delegates 2 382 delegates needed for nomination the final early june california primary came in 1992 when bill clinton beat jery brown there in addition to more significant wins in new jersey and new mexico to quash the anyone but clinton movement and lock down the nomination headed into the convention a feat his wife hopes to repeat tuesday here are eight places to watch on tuesday night as the results flow in los angeles county l a county doesn t just produce more than a quarter of democratic primary votes statewide it s also prime battleground territory the county which includes the city of los angeles and most of its suburbs went for clinton over obama in 2008 55 percent to 42 percent it s a place clinton needs to win in order to prevail statewide and the former secretary of state leads among l a county voters in pre election polls from usc dornsife los angeles times 46 percent to 42 percent among registered voters the field poll 50 percent to 40 percent and nbc news wall street journal marist 54 percent to 40 percent the county is extremely diverse according to the latest census estimates 27 percent of residents are white 9 percent black 48 percent hispanic and 15 percent asian but polls show voters split more by age than ethnicity with sanders winning big among younger latinos and clinton ahead by big margins among older latinos southern california after l a county the remainder of vote rich southern california is also up for grabs on tuesday eight years ago some of clinton s strongest performances in significantly representative counties came from southern california these counties include large numbers of white voters some of whom have defected to sanders this year but they also contain substantial hispanic populations and exit polls have showed clinton winning latinos in most states orange county where clinton beat obama by more than 18 points is still republican territory in the general election mitt romney won it by 6 points in 2012 but it produced more than 200 000 votes in the 2008 democratic primary clinton ran up even larger margins in san bernardino county 23 points and riverside county 24 points san diego county was more competitive with clinton beating obama there 50 percent to 43 percent east bay santa clara county sanders is likely to win san francisco but clinton can negate some of sanders advantage in the progressive stronghold by holding her own in three counties across the bay contra costa alameda and santa clara eight years ago two of the three counties produced more votes than san francisco obama won alameda 52 percent to 44 percent thanks in part to black voters in oakland many of whom will back clinton this time but also students on the campus of the university of california berkeley who appear more aligned with sanders this time clinton won a nearly 13 point victory in santa clara county which produced roughly as many votes as alameda 54 percent to 41 percent contra costa which is the least populous of the three counties was closer with clinton edging obama 49 percent to 44 percent two of the three polls released last week gave sanders the edge in the bay area overall though clinton led him there in the nbc news wall street journal marist poll albuquerque santa fe new mexico held party run caucuses in 2008 not a state primary with clinton narrowly edging obama clinton won a majority of hispanic voters in 2008 according to exit polls while obama won the majority of white voters as a result obama won two of the state s three congressional districts including the 1st which includes the city of albuquerque obama also won narrowly in the third district which includes all of northern new mexico but is anchored by the city of santa fe sanders figures to run strong in santa fe and the smaller overwhelmingly democratic city of taos do a ana county n m clinton carried the second district which spans southern new mexico in 2008 do a ana county home to las cruces is the second largest in the state it also includes areas that border mexico in addition to bordering el paso county texas while the gop race is virtually uncontested five other since departed candidates will appear on the ballot along with donald trump giving republicans who disapprove of trump s recent comments on hispanics and his immigration stances a number of options to defect northeast jersey areas of north jersey along the hudson river aren t politically or racially homogeneous bergen county the state s most populous voted for clinton over obama in 2008 59 percent to 39 percent that s about equal to the county s white population 59 percent with most of the ethnic minorities being hispanic 19 percent or asian 16 percent clinton also won big in hudson county which includes jersey city and hoboken majority minority essex county on the other hand backed obama 57 percent to 42 percent the county is anchored by newark the state s largest city where whites constitute only 12 percent of the population but it also includes some wealthier new york suburbs too camden county n j while most will think of the eponymous majority black city camden county also includes some tony philadelphia suburbs including cherry hill and haddonfield clinton actually carried camden county by a solid margin in 2008 with 55 percent of the vote clinton is expected to carry new jersey easily but camden county will be a good test of whether she can bring aboard african american voters who supported obama without losing the white voters who carried her eight years ago sanders county montana this county makes the list purely for symbolic reasons sanders has won eight of the nine clinton counties across the map with clinton s lone win coming in clinton county kentucky the only sanders county in the u s is in northern montana population 11 000 and it isclinton s only chance to turn the tables missing out on the latest
