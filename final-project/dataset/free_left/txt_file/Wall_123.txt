advertisement supported by it might be soon it might be a month away there s reason to hope and reason to be wary by joseph goldstein gov andrew m cuomo has said in the past week that he believes the number of coronavirus cases in new york will hit its high point this week and then hopefully begin to drop but even he acknowledges the uncertainty of that prediction the projection models have a number of alternatives he said at a news conference on monday some suggest basically the curve goes up and then drops precipitously some suggest a slight pause at the top some suggest there s a longer pause at the top which is effectively a plateau effect or again the straight up and straight down precipitous drop which is the peak effect no one can tell you which will occur others say the worst is still a little further off mayor bill de blasio has said he fears may could be worse than april and his health commissioner dr oxiris barbot has predicted the peak will come in late april or early may steve corwin the chief executive of newyork presbyterian hospital said he predicts the peak will happen on or around april 15th so who is right let s examine what the terminology means what we can expect and how much we should trust these predictions the peak is the high point on an epidemic curve which charts the number of cases over time you can track the number of new cases detected or the number of deaths epidemic curves have been around for a long time the times ran one in 1918 amid the spanish flu pandemic spanish flu deaths in new york city peaked five weeks into the epidemic public health officials have expressed hope that by closing schools and instructing families to isolate themselves they are flattening the epidemic curve instead of a steep increase and a sharp spike the curve will hopefully be a more gentle hump with a lower peak that takes longer to reach even if the overall number of cases were the same in the end a flattened curve would avoid a sudden surge of patients that could overwhelm hospitals and cause more people to die from lack of care there are several in new york city the number of hospitalizations has been relatively flat for more than a week the daily death toll has dropped in recent days after reaching 262 deaths on march 31 according to the department of health there are signs we are hitting a plateau mark levine who heads the city council s health committee said on twitter on monday at newyork presbyterian hospital the chief of surgery dr craig r smith wrote in a memo that was released by the hospital we are hurtling into weeks predicted to be our worst but he also offered a small dose of optimism scanning the daily statistics for the nyp system i can squint angulate the page and see the hint of a suggestion that the new case curve has flattened slightly over the past few days dr jim malatras the president of suny empire state college who previously served in mr cuomo s administration as director of state operations appeared with the governor on monday and said new york officials had been looking at projections that listed a possible peak to occur anywhere within 7 to 30 days it looks like we re at toward the earlier side of that time frame based on the current projections and modeling that we ve been looking at dr malatras said there are reasons to treat the data with caution the number of hospitalizations for instance depends not only on the number of new arrivals but also on hospital admission standards as hospitals have teetered on the brink of being overwhelmed they have sent home people whom they would have admitted just a few weeks earlier several new york doctors said in interviews so even if the number of hospitalizations appears to have plateaued that could be because the number of sick people turning up has lessened or it may have to do with changing hospital admissions standards or both and it s difficult to know what to make of the slight dip in deaths in recent days there are indications that deaths related to the coronavirus are being undercounted especially those who die of the illness at home patients can die of the illness several weeks after they were infected some after a lengthy period of time in a medically induced coma while a mechanical ventilator breathes for them for now doctors expect that many of those placed on ventilators will die there are thousands of covid patients currently on ventilators in new york officials have said we may yet see a rise in deaths as these patients possibly succumb to their illness the number of patients dying now in hospitals might offer information about the spread of the virus in the first weeks of march but it says little about the rate of new infections in reality we don t know said prof howard markel a doctor and historian of medicine at the university of michigan when asked if new york was nearing the peak it s very hard to separate the hopeful side of our brain from the scientific side updated may 12 2020 there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others this is a difficult question because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained a better question might be how will we know when to reopen the country in an american enterprise institute report scott gottlieb caitlin rivers mark b mcclellan lauren silvis and crystal watson staked out four goal posts for recovery hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested it seems to spread very easily from person to person especially in homes hospitals and other confined spaces the pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out it may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face no clinical trials are underway in the united states china and europe but american officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away unlike the flu there is no known treatment or vaccine and little is known about this particular virus so far it seems to be more lethal than the flu but the numbers are still uncertain and it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions not just those with respiratory diseases particularly hard if the family member doesn t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms while also keeping as much distance as possible according to guidelines issued by the c d c if there s space the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if masks are available both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters doorknobs toilets and tables don t forget to wash your hands frequently plan two weeks of meals if possible but people should not hoard food or supplies despite the empty shelves the supply chain remains strong and remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea that s not a good idea even if you re retired having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation or even grows makes sense but retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years watching your balance go up and down can be scary you may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions don t if your employer matches any part of your contributions make sure you re at least saving as much as you can to get that free money mr cuomo has referred to predictions by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington known as ihme as well as predictions generated by mckinsey company and weill cornell medicine the models serve a purpose and governor cuomo has spoken of their importance to leaders amid a pandemic i follow data he has said i don t have instinct i don t have a gut it s not about emotion the accuracy of these models remains to be seen the ihme model has in recent days been revised and its updated projections are generally less dire than earlier ones it predicts new york state will hit its peak number of hospitalizations on april 8 modeling is just one piece of data among a mosaic of data spread out on the floor that has not yet been put into place said professor markel who has written about past epidemics in new york city they re simply based on assumptions that may or may not be wrong and they re created by people who don t take care of patients and may not be in the thick of the epidemic and may not be asking the right questions and the data about the coronavirus in new york is uncertain at best nobody quite knows when the virus began circulating in new york nor is there any consensus of how many people are infected given that public health officials have repeatedly changed the eligibility criteria for testing more recently in new york city public health officials have discouraged testing except for the sickest patients it s too early to tell some public health officials say as time passes and more data comes in the shape of new york s curve will become clearer but there is a growing sense that new york city should have begun social distancing measures earlier new york s curve may not have been flattened because they were kind of late to do things closing schools for example professor markel said if you re late what our data shows you may not achieve that flattening it s possible that new york s epidemic curve in 2020 becomes a cautionary tale to other cities about the importance of strict social distancing early on just as philadelphia s initial response to the 1918 pandemic became a reference point for public health officials on what not to do i hope that the rest of the country sees that these lockdowns are essential dr corwin the president of newyork presbyterian said because you don t want to get into the situation that we find ourselves in now in new york city professor markel warned that letting up on social distancing measures too quickly following the peak would be a major mistake noting that cities that did that during the pandemic of 1918 faced a second surge of cases we saw that a lot in 1918 we called them double humped curves they were not generally as bad as the first hump but they were pretty bad professor markel said jesse mckinley contributed reporting advertisement
