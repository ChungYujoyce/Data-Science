advertisement transcript jiayang do you remember the first time that you started thinking about the backlash in this country against asian americans in response to the coronavirus yeah i mean around i guess this is the beginning of march i had seen on instagram a friend and a fellow writer documenting an incident in manhattan where i think he is korean american and he was told by a stranger to get away but i remember reading about that incident and thinking yeah i mean that s really terrible that this has happened but wondering is this a singular incident or is there a trend as a journalist and perhaps by my own personal temperament i m pretty cautious i don t like to make sensational generalizations that go well on a headline i feel like i need very convincing proof that something is happening before i call it and especially as a chinese american i wanted to make sure that i was not crying racism before i had the full evidence i wonder if it s because if i don t make too big a deal out of it it won t be fully real from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily i get to the gate at lax home depot in an uber pool a grocery store wegmans we were walking from the gym to get in our classrooms i got some milk a little pasta most everything s gone and at that moment there was this guy looked like a regular guy he was staring at me as the death toll from the coronavirus rises in the u s so do reports of verbal and physical attacks against asian americans and a couple of seats away from me a man was seated and presumably his wife comes back to sit down and says out loud you people you brought it you re sick fuck china china is stupid i ought to kill you i ought to shoot you this girl looks chinese she must have the virus i can t sit next to her who say that they are being blamed for the pandemic a person at the white house used the term kung flu my question is do you think that s wrong kung flu kung flu and do you think using the term chinese virus that puts asian americans at risk that people might target them no not at all no not at all i think they probably would agree with it 100 it comes from china there s nothing not to agree with i ll have the last question today when the president asked i don t think they would mind it being called the chinese virus i mind it did make me feel different and didn t really want to be chinese because of the coronavirus jiayang fan a writer for the new yorker magazine shares her story it s friday april 10th jiayang can you tell me a little bit about your childhood where did you grow up i was born in 1984 in chongqing china my mom was a doctor my dad was a researcher and he was one of the first batch of scholars sent to the u s to bring western knowledge and technology back to china so he leaves when i m about two so i have very little memory of him but for my mom and i life in china feels very serene and comfortable whatever sense i have of the outside world the world beyond china is very very vague and incredibly hazy like i m not quite sure it exists but i think if one place were to stand out it would be the united states i remember my mom and her friends talking about the show dynasty which did telegraph the glamor of the u s i like that one it s a rather expensive fur i like the mink that is mink the sense that this is what an everyday joe would inhabit and this of course is a soap opera about an incredibly wealthy oil family living in a crazy gorgeous home and driving along oil fields so it s actually quite exceptional my name happens to be mrs steven carrington i m not used to haggling over what suits me or what it costs well it was the show and it was also at the time in china what was very popular were these calendars of american families where every member had golden hair sparkling blue eyes and perfect bone structure and they were always smiling with their perfect white teeth they always were sitting by a perfect colonial house or just out in nature but in front of a park that they looked like they owned and i remember the food that really encapsulated america to me were cheerios cheerios it s the big yellow box that everyone knows yes cheerios i had no idea what they tasted like but the company did fantastic branding in china cheerios number one we love it toasty oat goodness i remember the picture of the perfect baby on these ads for cheerios you know the round cheeks the blue eyes that baby got to have this superior breakfast food that i in all likelihood would never get to taste cheerios number one so there s me drinking my chinese porridge and eating my pickled vegetables and having fantasies about cheerios which i learned years later to not be very tasty at all there they re actually tasteless to be like the definition of blandness but in your mind they are this superior food for this blond haired perfect group of people yeah for superior people to put it bluntly i mean i still remember actually the first time i heard english i think it might have been my fifth or sixth birthday and my mom might have come back pretty recently from english language training sessions and she just said the words happy birthday that was astounding to me it was like my mom was superwoman that she knew how to say this language that did not sound like a language to me happy birthday i still remember the way the syllables came out of her mouth and the image which was of a tsunami there was this tidal wave of one syllable consuming the next one that to me was very incomprehensible and i remember at the time thinking i will never learn this language i have no hopes of ever learning this language which is probably ok because i only need one language right and it s chinese oh but essentially something happens in the june of 89 that changes my father s fate as well as that of my mom and i forever the noise of gunfire rose from all over the center of peking the tiananmen massacre there s a mood of terror in the center of the city and quiet so the u s government immediately makes provisions for chinese scholars who might need to flee from china the demonstrators in tiananmen square and that was when my mother and i joined my father in the u s what do you remember about first arriving in the u s we land in j f k and my father is living at the time in new haven connecticut and that drive from j f k to new haven it is gray and drab like tones that are not at all what i had imagined so i keep waiting for the real america to reveal itself to me so it is a rude awakening when my dad leads us to his second floor studio there s just a mattress on the floor and i think it takes me a good minute to realize that this is my new home and the loss of a language is pretty traumatic for me how so school started a few months later and i could not understand my teachers my classmates and repeatedly my new american teachers ask me why aren t you talking more why aren t you engaging and those expectations i think are hard for me to fully understand and i feel like i m walking blind into a game where i don t know the rules mm hm i mean not only do i not speak the language i m bringing pickled fish and rice and that s not sitting well with the other kids at a lunch table all i feel is defeat hm it sounds very lonely yeah retrospectively i think what made me feel most lonely was that i couldn t share those feelings with my mother and i think for my mother who worked very low paying menial labor jobs in the u s a drastic step down from her position as a doctor in china she must have felt as marginalized and as embarrassed by her immigrant status as i do but in an adult way but similarly lacking in an emotional vocabulary to express those feelings what do you mean like i remember going to the mall for the first time with my mother and my mom s favorite pastime was window shopping just looking at things that she couldn t afford and i remember one time someone trying to hand her maybe a flyer for some store and she said no thanks but she couldn t pronounce it correctly so this young man said no sex did you say no sex no sex and i think i was like 11 or 12 at the time i remember that my mother actually just in this embarrassed way laughed like out of anxiety like she wanted it to be ok she wanted to respond in a way to indicate that she was not offended but i remember the way that my cheek just felt hot and red they grew and how i felt so humiliated on my mother s behalf and that experience feels seared into my brain not just because of the insult but because my mother had to swallow her own humiliation did you understand given your age that this was racism i mean how did you process it in that moment i think i turned over the incident in my mind for a long time after that i don t think i would have coded it as racism i think i almost only understood racism as something that white people inflicted on black people i had no idea or i had very little idea of how asians fit into the landscape of race in the u s and i didn t know how to understand incidents in which you were not called a very specific racial slur like that no thanks no sex like what was that what was that exactly i think as an 11 year old in my head i didn t want to be different i didn t want to be the one lashing out at others for being racist because inevitably that would make me seem even more different and i think my mother my mother was the closest person in my life but if she had a religion it would be survival i learned from my mother not to rock the boat not to shake the existing system to basically understand how the existing system works and then to ascend it in some way to climb the ladder as long as you fit in better you will live a more comfortable life here and that should be the goal and did things start to get a little bit better eventually i start speaking better english i start really enjoying and then falling in love with the english language something that i thought would never happen that s really important for me i have to admit when that language english came to feel like a part of my body i have to say that felt like a homecoming to me hm and how old are you at this point where you re starting to fall in love with the language i think around maybe 12 or 13 mm hm and i ll never forget the first time in sixth grade when i said the phrase come on like this sounds silly but it was only sixth grade when i could comfortably say come on to a schoolmate and i felt very triumphant as if to say enough of that come on exactly when i could say that i was so aware of myself saying it and i was saying it the way that a normal american speaker would say it and i ll never forget the sense of pride that coursed through me and there was no one i could celebrate it with right because imagine if then i turned to the classmate who i said come on with and said did you hear me i just said come on that would have totally defeated its purpose but i remember it because it felt like a real americanism and it just rolled off my tongue so in that moment you finally feel like you belong exactly but i still see myself predominantly as a visitor and that my existence is pretty probational on good behavior and if i behave well i will be able to minimize the number of times that i stick out as someone who doesn t belong but then i started to realize that s not exactly how it works we ll be right back so jiayang i wonder if you can tell me about what happened to you recently so this was in mid march when there were rumors that new york city would be put under lockdown because of coronavirus and i wanted to make sure i had enough food in the house if i had to stay in for an indefinite period of time mm hm and i was also really worried about my mother who has a neurodegenerative disease and lives in a nursing home close by i knew that i wouldn t be able to see her for a while and i had several errands lined up one was to take out the trash one was to mail my rent check and one was to go a few blocks away to my neighbor s house to pick up a sack of rice it was around evening time and i had just left my apartment building and i was on the phone talking to my mother s health aide in chinese and as i was turning around after putting the trash in the trash bin this is right in front of my apartment i heard chinese chinese chinese bitch fucking chinese but it all i don t think i fully believed what i was hearing and when i made eye contact with him he kept speaking you re fucking chinese and i realized that that i was comprehending that what he was saying did not stop him mm hm that was when in my ear my mom s aide paused and said are you ok is something happening and i couldn t really speak i found myself walking down the street i think i was still really set on i need to get rice but then i found it really hard to continue walking because my legs just felt leaden like i really really wanted to continue walking it would have only been a 10 minute walk away for me to fetch that rice but i found myself coming to a halt and even i thought if i just kept talking on the phone with my aide but then i thought i m talking in chinese who else am i going to offend and then i just got off the phone and once i got off the phone i felt even more scared because i was so aware of being alone so this is not embarrassment or even shame in this moment this is just terror this is a very real sense of fright that i m not going to make it to my friend s house to get my sack of rice jiayang we started this conversation with you saying that your instinct and maybe it s because you re a journalist maybe it s as an asian american maybe it s both is to minimize these incidents and to be slow to see them as part of a larger phenomenon but it sounds like this was different for you am i right to think that yeah i mean this is not the first time i ve been called a chinese bitch but what was different about this incident was that this man seemed to really mean it and i wondered i mean in retrospect right i wondered at the relationship between the sense of conviction in the man s voice his certainty that he was in the right to point out my chineseness and to call me a chinese bitch mm hm and i think about the things that were going on in his day like did he lose his job earlier in the day because of this virus i mean does he work in the service industry does he have a loved one who has also become a prisoner in a nursing home or hospital and i think about the way that all those anxieties and rage and sadness might have hardened into something like an instrument almost a weapon hm and i think about me being a surface onto which he could use that weapon and lash out hm and i think about the probational nature of my chinese american existence in a sense that in better times in normal times there are certain stereotypes that are cast upon me when i walk down the street but in a moment of crisis when it seems plausible that the country where i was born could be responsible for an unprecedented pandemic that i become a person of suspicion and i become someone who is quite easy perhaps to target all your ire and anxieties and that maybe it gave him temporary relief to be able to identify someone or something as the cause for his hurt and for his anxieties so what do you do so i go home double lock my door pull out my phone and get on twitter ok yes i describe what happened and i tweet i wasn t offended i was afraid i was worried he knew where i lived for the longest time i ve been telling friends in china that although racism against chinese exists in this country that s not what i feel in a pandemic i ve never felt like this in my 27 years in this country i ve never felt afraid to leave my home to take out the trash because of my face i want to believe what happened is anomalous and that we re living in extraordinary times and fear can deform us i wonder now if i should have taken his picture i wonder what your mother would make of this incident and i wonder what she would think of the fact that you decided to share what happened to you so publicly i think if i were to tell her about the experience she might not fully understand the import of it she would say well were you hurt and i would say no and she would say well did you lose anything and i would say no and she would say do you feel like this man is going to cut you down and kill you now and i would say probably not no and she would say well why are you even telling me this what is the big deal here hm or if i were to tell her that i was having this conversation with you she would say why make something out of nothing right she would say why are you crying victim here why are you making this into a bigger deal than it really is do you want this to be how you re remembered for being that woman who was the victim of a non incident and what would you say in this imaginary conversation with your mother i think i would try in english because i think it would be hard for me to find the words in chinese to explain the significance of it not on my physical well being help me understand what you mean because for the longest i mean i think my mom and i both lived with this fiction that if we could be perfect versions of ourselves for example if my mother could pronounce thanks the way that it s supposed to be pronounced and for me if i could say come on naturally that had always been the goal of our american existence was to somehow bend ourselves to a shape that america could accept i never dared to believe that i could actually help to make america better that was something i never dared to think was possible but in experiencing this it made me rethink my role as an american and how even me even someone who is probationary that i was in some very very small way contributing to this country by pointing out the ways that it s failing itself making clear the way in which this country still makes me feel ashamed is possibly one way in which i can make it better hm and also that s the best version of america like in all the conceptions of america that exist in my head i actually think this ability to call out the worst parts of america to itself my freedom to do so this feels to me the most miraculous part of america but i think all of that would be frankly a bit too abstract to my mother i think her quest for survival has been so concrete and lived i ll never be able to repay her for the way that her very concrete existence has paved the way for my more luxuriantly abstract one but that maybe that s a boundary between us that i ve been able to cross and that no matter how many ways i try to explain it in what language if she ll fully understand but i really needed to make sure that for my own sake i could know that this did happen that this was not a figment of my imagination or that in an hour s time or in 12 hours time i would try to minimize it in my own mind thank you very much for your time we really appreciate it jiayang thank you so much for having me i m so sorry that you had the experience you had i am too but i m sure it will be a small experience in what is hopefully a very long and a much bigger one of living in america and being american we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today majority leader our nation continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic more than 400 000 americans have tested positive nearly 15 000 have lost their lives and important public health measures are creating an economic catastrophe on thursday the labor department said that another 6 6 million americans filed for unemployment benefits in the past week that means mr president more than 16 million americans have lost their jobs in only the last three weeks a tragedy that is hard to even comprehend economists now believe that the u s unemployment rate is the worst since the great depression the latest figures put even deeper pressure on congress to adopt a new round of economic relief for workers but on thursday that legislation hit a roadblock in the senate democrats want to double the size of the bill by adding hundreds of billions of dollars for hospitals and local governments which are facing major financial shortfalls we don t have to divide along the usual lines so soon after we came together for the country to my democratic colleagues please please do not block emergency aid you do not even oppose just because you want something more but republicans led by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell say that money can wait let s continue to work together with speed and bipartisanship we will get through this crisis together the daily is made by theo balcomb andy mills lisa tobin

say why make something out of nothing right she would say why are you crying victim here why are you making this into a bigger deal than it really is do you want this to be how you re remembered for being that woman who was the victim of a non incident and what would you say in this imaginary conversation with your mother i think i would try in english because i think it would be hard for me to find the words in chinese to explain the significance of it not on my physical well being help me understand what you mean because for the longest i mean i think my mom and i both lived with this fiction that if we could be perfect versions of ourselves for example if my mother could pronounce thanks the way that it s supposed to be pronounced and for me if i could say come on naturally that had always been the goal of our american existence was to somehow bend ourselves to a shape that america could accept i never dared to believe that i could actually help to make america better that was something i never dared to think was possible but in experiencing this it made me rethink my role as an american and how even me even someone who is probationary that i was in some very very small way contributing to this country by pointing out the ways that it s failing itself making clear the way in which this country still makes me feel ashamed is possibly one way in which i can make it better hm and also that s the best version of america like in all the conceptions of america that exist in my head i actually think this ability to call out the worst parts of america to itself my freedom to do so this feels to me the most miraculous part of america but i think all of that would be frankly a bit too abstract to my mother i think her quest for survival has been so concrete and lived i ll never be able to repay her for the way that her very concrete existence has paved the way for my more luxuriantly abstract one but that maybe that s a boundary between us that i ve been able to cross and that no matter how many ways i try to explain it in what language if she ll fully understand but i really needed to make sure that for my own sake i could know that this did happen that this was not a figment of my imagination or that in an hour s time or in 12 hours time i would try to minimize it in my own mind thank you very much for your time we really appreciate it jiayang thank you so much for having me i m so sorry that you had the experience you had i am too but i m sure it will be a small experience in what is hopefully a very long and a much bigger one of living in america and being american we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today majority leader our nation continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic more than 400 000 americans have tested positive nearly 15 000 have lost their lives and important public health measures are creating an economic catastrophe on thursday the labor department said that another 6 6 million americans filed for unemployment benefits in the past week that means mr president more than 16 million americans have lost their jobs in only the last three weeks a tragedy that is hard to even comprehend economists now believe that the u s unemployment rate is the worst since the great depression the latest figures put even deeper pressure on congress to adopt a new round of economic relief for workers but on thursday that legislation hit a roadblock in the senate democrats want to double the size of the bill by adding hundreds of billions of dollars for hospitals and local governments which are facing major financial shortfalls we don t have to divide along the usual lines so soon after we came together for the country to my democratic colleagues please please do not block emergency aid you do not
