it is barely worth pointing out that donald trump s surprise visit to mexico on wednesday won t do president enrique pe a nieto much good pe a nieto is deeply unpopular in his home country with a quarterly survey from the newspaper reforma putting his favorability at 23 percent a figure so low that it makes trump himself at 35 percent seem positively embraced that 35 percent is in the united states of course in mexico trump s a lot less popular a june survey showed trump at 75 percent unfavorability in the country compared with hillary clinton s 6 percent when ipsos asked people around the world in june who they d pick in the american presidential contest no country saw a wider gap than mexico mexico preferred clinton to trump by an 88 to 1 margin an 87 point spread the only countries that preferred trump were china and russia the next closest countries were belgium and sweden where clinton was preferred by 66 points there s a correlation between trump spoll numbers and the mexican economy when he does better the value of the peso has dropped less than 12 hours after the news of trump s visit broke other mexican politicians had already weighed in to oppose welcoming trump to the country politico collected some examples we are threatened with war and walls but we open the national palace the president of the mexican senate wrote adding that the invitation approved of trump s proposal of demagogy and hate a former diplomat tweeted i feel embarrassed as a mexican thanks to my president on cnn on wednesday morning former president vicente fox who has been outspoken about trump disparaged pe a nieto s decision i just can t envision him sitting on that chair that was the chair of pres washington he doesn t even know how to run a biz fox on trump this response is not surprising from the first moments of his candidacy trump railed against mexico even before that he complained about mexico on twitter in part because he won a lawsuit in the country but hasn t been able to collect when will the u s stop sending s to our enemies i e mexico and others from our standpoint though the bigger question is how this benefits trump in the past pe a nieto has criticized trump and his proposals in march pe a nieto compared trump to adolf hitler and benito mussolini saying that trump s strident rhetoric was of a piece with the arguments those leaders used to gain power pe a nieto has also flatly rejected trump s signature policy proposal to build a wall on the border and have mexico pay for it not going to happen pe a nieto said to fareed zakariaof the washington post and cnn there is no way that mexico can pay for a wall like that after trump and pe a nieto meet that will be the first question that s asked of trump did pe a nieto agree to pay for the wall unless of course trump s arrival is met with the sort of demonstrations that his appearances have earned in the past in san jose and san diego pe a nieto unpopular has a clear political incentive to embarrass trump on the issue a sort of i invited him here to boss him around sort of thing it s perhaps pe a nieto s only possible positive political outcome but even if things progress quietly it forces the issue trump says he ll make mexico pay and mexico says it won t now what trump has never been able to answer that question update sure enough one deeply optimistic trump supporter former congressman joe walsh figures that trump obtaining a promise to pay for the wall would be game set match which is true it is also true that if pe a nieto gives trump proof that clinton was a space alien intent on destroying the globe that it would benefit trump neither is likely to happen what does trump get out of it we assume that pe a nieto will pose for photos with the visiting dignitary though that seems like a political miscalculation for him trump as statesman is a new one and it will be interesting to see how it s handled that photo itself encapsulates a lot of the risk reward calculus for trump at best he gets a dull picture of himself standing next to a person with whom most americans aren t familiar at worst he gets an awkward picture posing in front of the mexican flag something that some part of his base probably won t be thrilled about the trip will at best show that trump can go to a foreign country and meet with leaders without incident a fairly low item on the presidential checklist a subject for another time do voters actually care about a grip and greet at worst who knows the move feels a bit like john mccain s decision in september 2008 to suspend his campaign to deal with the economy it felt gimmicky and didn t do much and reinforced that mccain was in the sort of political position that necessitated gimmicks that might not do much barring a joe walsh esque miracle trump s trip to mexico instills a lot of risk with the potential upside for trump being that he proved he can do something fairly simple without incident for pe a nieto the potential upside is that he can score points off an unpopular visitor the downside is that he is seen as embracing someone his constituents vehemently dislike given how low the reward is for trump and how high the possibility that something might go wrong there s a decent chance that the politician for whom trump s trip is beneficial ishis opponent receive the most
