advertisement supported by by jonathan martin and maggie haberman washington in the five weeks since the last republican presidential debate terrorists have struck in paris and san bernardino calif donald j trump has proposed barring muslims from coming to america ben carson s support has evaporated and senator ted cruz of texas has emerged as mr trump s stiffest competition senator marco rubio of florida has gone on the attack against mr cruz and gov chris christie of new jersey who has less money than many senators up for re election has shown signs of life at least in new hampshire all of which is to say that tuesday night s debate at the venetian resort hotel casino in las vegas will showcase a markedly changed race mr cruz who is showing signs of consolidating support among hard line conservatives is likely to come under sharp attack issues like national security and immigration will take on greater urgency and candidates who are struggling to leapfrog into contention are sure to try to seize on one of the last ripe opportunities to do so before voters in the early nominating states begin making up their minds but while much has changed one figure remains the same mr trump the leader in national polls and the field s chief provocateur and pacesetter whose sometimes outrageous and demagogic comments have not only roiled the race but also amplified divisions between party leaders and the conservative grass roots nowhere has that been more evident than with mr trump s call last week to bar muslims from entering the country an inflammatory idea that his rivals will almost certainly respond to at the debate none of them will second mr trump s proposal but the degree to which they repudiate him or else delicately try to tap into the same fears in a more considered way will illustrate how they are positioning themselves with mr trump s supporters with nearly six in 10 republicans backing the proposal but about the same number of americans over all opposing it according to a new washington post abc news poll the rest of the field must weigh how to avoid appearing out of step with republican primary voters without appearing to support discrimination in a way that could do grave damage to their prospects in a general election the problem for the other candidates is that trump is initiating and shaping the conversation on national security at a time of great anxiety and they re forced to react said kevin madden a republican strategist not affiliated with any candidate who called mr trump s proposal offensive unconstitutional and entirely unworkable the key is for the other candidates to say we need to do a better job making our immigration and visa system safer and here s an alternative that isn t rooted in something that would be viable mr madden said see what the candidates are saying about gun control immigration and more and how their positions align with the american people the sharpened focus on national security and immigration will also illuminate tensions among mr christie mr cruz and mr rubio while putting immense pressure on mr carson mr rubio and mr cruz have been locking horns for weeks on immigration and national security and they are likely to clash tuesday with mr cruz surging into first place in two recent iowa polls and terrorism emerging as the top issue mr rubio is likely to step up his assault on mr cruz for his support of guest worker visas and of restrictions on some domestic surveillance programs mr cruz has responded by highlighting mr rubio s work on a 2013 effort to offer illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship a major vulnerability for mr rubio among conservatives in tuesday s debate mr cruz will almost certainly invoke amnesty to bludgeon mr rubio if given the chance remarkably mr rubio s role in the bipartisan effort to overhaul immigration laws has not been brought up once in the previous four debates history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling mr rubio though would most likely counter or try to pre empt such an attack by questioning mr cruz s somewhat muddled views about what to do with immigrants already in the country illegally and mr trump who advocates mass deportation could join in the pile on now that mr cruz has emerged as his biggest threat mr rubio and mr cruz can also expect to come under attack from mr christie who has staked his fortunes on doing well in new hampshire there mr rubio who is averaging second place in the polls poses an obstacle to be overcome he s never here mr christie said of mr rubio while campaigning in that state over the weekend come on marco mr rubio s supporters include some of the center right voters to whom mr christie is making a case and both are focused on a muscular response to the rising threat of islamic state terrorism mr cruz meanwhile has proposed carpet bombing isis using an acronym for the islamic state but his support for stricter surveillance laws and his limited experience as a first term senator will probably invite criticism from mr christie who has begun more sharply contrasting his experience as a federal prosecutor with the senators in the race then there is mr carson the retired neurosurgeon who took the lead in some national polls this fall but has since fallen sharply amid questions about his grasp of national security he could fade from contention for good if he is not able to speak authoritatively about how he would confront the threat of terrorism nick ryan a republican strategist in iowa who is advising the super pac supporting mike huckabee said mr cruz could face the most difficult outing i would expect that he and rubio will tussle a little bit mr ryan said but the big question he said is mr trump who until now has appeared to pull his punches against mr cruz sometimes he appears willing to attack cruz other times he wants to pretend that they re best buddies mr ryan said of mr trump and i think if trump wants to dispatch him then he better engage with him that would present mr cruz with a potentially pivotal choice whether to keep turning the other cheek to a front runner he has sought to embrace or to strike back against the candidate who could be standing in the way of his nomination advertisement
