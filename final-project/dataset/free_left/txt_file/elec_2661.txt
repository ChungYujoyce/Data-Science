gop nominee softened his stance on the signature issue of his campaign and talked african american unemployment while trying to court the non white vote lauren gambino fri 26 aug 2016 12 00bst last

summer donald trump burst into the political ring with a fiery proposal to build a great great wall along the us mexico border paid for by mexico an ultra hardline stance on immigration has remained at the heart of his campaign though reporters have had a notoriously difficult time pinning him down on what he actually proposes to do to or with the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants who currently live in america he has suggested a deportation force to remove them we re rounding em up in a very humane way in a very nice way and they re going to be happy because they want to be legalized trump told cbs last september and by the way i know it doesn t sound nice but not everything is nice on saturday after meeting with his hispanic advisory council reports emerged that the republican candidate was softening his stance the next day newly installed campaign manager kellyanne conway appeared to waffle on whether trump was still committed to deportation in an interview with fox news trump himself denied that he was flip flopping to gain more time to fine tune the campaign postponed a speech he was due to give on thursday on wednesday trump said immigrants not in the us legally would not get citizenship but also appeared to offer a path a forward and to contradict his previous promises that undocumented migrants would be deported they ll pay back taxes they have to pay taxes there s no amnesty as such there s no amnesty but we work with them trump said in a town hall with fox news anchor sean hannity the next morning he met african american and latino activists at trump tower in new york such apparent moderation on immigration comes as trump tries to aggressively court hispanic and african american voters polling shows trump trailing hillary clinton a quinnipiac university poll released on thursday gives clinton a 62 point lead over trump among likely non white voters the democrats have failed completely in the inner cities for those hurting the most who have been failed and failed by their politicians year after year failure after failure worse numbers after worse numbers poverty rejection horrible education no housing no homes no ownership crime at levels that nobody s seen you can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it s safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the democrats and i ask you this i ask you this crime all of the problems to the african americans who i employ so many so many people to the hispanics tremendous people what the hell do you have to lose 22 august speech akron ohio there s a lot to unpack in this statement at best trump is offering a broad brush portrait of america s cities and at worst he s using language that is offensive to the very voters he s trying to reach trump also claims crime is at levels that nobody s seen based on the context and past statements about crime statistics we can assume he means crime is at record heights but this bleak picture of crime ridden american streets more dangerous than parts of the world where the us is engaged in military action such as afghanistan and iraq runs counter to a trend of declining crime that has persisted for more than a quarter of a century though crime statistics are notoriously ripe for manipulation studies show a steady decline since 1991 particular demographics particularly low income areas do continue to show high rates of criminal activity trump also claims to employ so many so many african americans in his various businesses however a june analysis by the associated press found few if any black executives in the upper echelon of trump s organization trump has recently dialed up his outreach to african american voters but he delivers his speeches before largely white audiences a recent nbc wall street journal poll showed trump receiving the support of only 1 of african american voters look at how much african american communities are suffering from democratic control 58 of your youth is unemployed what the hell do you have to lose 19 august dimondale michigan trump and his campaign raised eyebrows when they repeated this eye popping statistic that more than half of young black men and women are unemployed the latest figures from the bureau of labor statistics bls put the unemployment rate among 16 to 19 year old black americans at 25 7 adjusted seasonally so how did he get to 58 the campaign s economic adviser david malpass told abc news it began with bls data from 2015 and broke out the numbers for 16 to 24 year old african americans as part of its calculation the campaign included labor force participants and those outside the labor force including people who have no job or are not looking for one such as students and retirees these are sectors of the population the federal government does not count as unemployed the campaign then divided the larger number by the population of the 16 to 24 age group to reach 58 5 abc reported economists have said it is statistically misleading to include segments of the population that are actively not seeking employment
