the big idea the drudge report has aggressively portrayed ted cruz s sweep of all the delegates from colorado s republican convention as a corrupt power grab the site named for matt drudge who broke the story of bill clinton s affair with monica lewinsky and still runs it links to nine stories this morning with salacious headlines about the convention among them savage cruz should disavow rigged colorado election buchanan apparatchiks thieve delegates for ted 1 million republicans sidelined border patrol agents colorado voters disenfranchised keep in mind that this is three days after the colorado convention our analytics partners at zignal labs say the drudge attacks are breaking through on social media in a significant way this word cloud which tracks all cruz mentions since saturday shows the extent to which drudge has shaped the conversation about cruz s win in colorado note the prominence of the words cheating and drudge this kind of squabbling will only get louder as the delegate wrestling and wrangling intensifies and it has clearly gotten under cruz s skin in a radio interview yesterday the texas senator ripped into drudge as an arm of donald trump s campaign in about the past month the drudge report has basically become the attack site for the trump campaign he told conservative host mike slater so every day they have the latest trump attack they re directed at me most days they have a six month old article that is some attack on me and it s whatever the trump campaign is pushing that day will be the banner headline on drudge by the way they no longer cover news cruz added of drudge when we win a state suddenly the state doesn t matter you know colorado there was no red siren on drudge when we won all 34 delegates in colorado drudge responded by posting a link to a january fox newsinterview in which cruz praised the conservative site for breaking the mainstream media s stranglehold it s never good to pick a fight with a guy who buys ink by the barrel as they say or whatever the 2016 version of that line is if it was just trump complaining about the crooked system it would seem like sour grapes from a guy who got out hustled but the donald s allies in the right wing media including drudge and breitbart are trying tomake cruz s wins seem illegitimate in the eyes of the conservative base if cruz wins the nomination at a contested convention in cleveland he will need these grass roots activiststo rally around him if regular drudge readers believe he did not win fair and square they will be less inclined to do so interestingly the increasing scrutiny from drudge comes as the democratic national committee begins to train more of its fire at cruz after focusing almost single mindedly on trump for months the dnc held a press call yesterday to blast the texan ahead of campaign stops in california ironically they pushed a similar message as drudge cruz s campaign is proving to be just as divisive for the republican party as his tenure in the senate has been for our country said the dnc communications director that s why there just isn t a whole lot of excitement for cruz being the republican nominee donald trump says he identifies with howard roark from ayn rand s the fountainhead he praised the novel and its protagonist in a broader interview with usa today that posted yesterday it relates to business beauty life and inner emotions that book relates to everything the gop front runner told the paper columnist kirsten powers writes that she pointed out that the fountainhead is in a way about the tyranny of groupthink trump reportedly sat up and told her that s what is happening here for those who haven t read the booksince high school roark is an architect who dynamites a housing project he designed because he is angry about changes that others made to his blueprints he s then put on trial for arson but a jury acquits him after he delivers an eloquent speech about the need to always stay true to one s self gary cooper delivered the courtroom monologue in the 1949 film adaptation bottom line roark is a self centered individualist who steadfastly refuses to submit to the will of others he is presented as the author s version of an ideal man one who embodies the virtues of rand s objectivist philosophy the cliffnotes character analysis explains roark is an example of free will the theory that an individual has the power by virtue of the choices he makes to control the outcome of his own life a man s thinking and values are not controlled by god or the fates or society or any external factor but solely by his own choice is the donald threatening to blow up the republican party if he s spurned in cleveland he almost certainly has not thought through the implications of publicly identifying with roark and embracing objectivism but it s nonetheless another revealing window into his psyche it s also a reflection of how trump does not play by the same rules that normal politicians must in2012 paul ryan tried hard to distance himself from rand whose work he had often praised i adored her novels when i was young and in many ways they gave me an interest in economics he told the new york times magazine in 2014 but as a devout practicing catholic i completely reject the philosophy of objectivism while you were sleeping forty percent of former nfl players show signs

clinton convened a round table style discussion where she along with the local congressman rep steve israel d and gun safety advocates hammered sanders here s what i want you to know most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in new york come from out of state the state that has the highest per capita number of those guns that end up committing crime in new york come from vermont clinton said eliciting gasps so this is not oh no i live in a rural state we don t have any of these problems the post s fact checker gives clinton three pinocchios for this line of attack clinton has carefully crafted the talking point to find the particular government data that support her point which gives a wildly different view than how trafficking flows are tracked michelle ye hee lee writes we do not find the per capita measure as a fair assessment of gun flows from vermont into new york the difference between this point using per capita calculation and the raw number 1 percent of crime guns with source states identified in 2014 came from vermont is so stark that it creates a significantly misleading impression to the public sanders called for a national ban on

because big oil pumps millions into their campaigns bernie sanders is the only candidate for president who opposes fracking everywhere joe biden said sanders calling clinton unqualified was notsexist but something saidin the heat of a campaign during an interview with mic com the vice president was asked about sanders comment and if he thought hillary is held to a higher standard because she is a woman no i don t think she s held to a higher standard he replied this country s ready for a woman biden elaborated there s no problem we re going to be able to elect a woman in this country when the female interviewer asked biden if he d like to see a woman elected a male aide to the vp interrupted from off camera and tried to end the interview that s it he said i would like to see a woman elected biden said i don t mind he told the staffers standing off camera the president and i are not going to endorse because we both when we ran said let the party decide but gosh almighty they re both qualified he added hillary is overwhelmingly qualified to be president past cases suggest hillary won t be indicted by politico sjosh gerstein a review of dozens of recent federal investigations suggests that it s highly unlikely but not impossible the examination found some parallels to clinton s use of a private server for her emails but in nearly all instances that were prosecuted aggravating circumstances existed that don t appear to be present in clinton s case the relatively few cases that drew prosecution almost always involved a deliberate intent to violate classification rules as well as some add on element a boeing engineer who brought home 2000 classified documents and whose travel to israel raised suspicions a nsa official who removed boxes of classified documents and also lied on a job application form and former prosecutors investigators and defense attorneys generally agree that prosecution for classified information breaches is the exception rather than the rule they always involve some plus factor one former federal prosecutor said bill de blasio intimated in an interview with katie couric that his kids are supporting sanders even though he s backing clinton my kids will speak for themselves he told the yahoo anchor but i ll say this much they re the kind of young person that is going to fight for change no matter what and absolutely will support
