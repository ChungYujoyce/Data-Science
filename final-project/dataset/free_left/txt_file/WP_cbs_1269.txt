the following is a transcript of the interview with democratic sen joe manchin of west virginia that aired sunday august 18 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan we start this morning in coal country with west virginia senator joe manchin he joins us from charleston good to have you on the program senator joe manchin good to be with you margaret margaret brennan senator you ve been very supportive of president trump s trade war given the worries that we re seeing emerge this weekend the president s decision to pull back on some tariffs related to consumers are you having second thoughts senator joe manchin well no and i i ve been very hawkish on china because china does their intent is not for america to succeed or do well with that being said the way they ve been able to have their economic might and also their military might has been through espionage so we have to be very careful of that and we have to be very much aware of that so i think there s a time for correction and this is it now with that being said i would say in we should be strengthening our ties with all of our allies and bringing on more allies that we can do good trade with honest fair trade competitive trade but not unfair trade such as has been done with china for far too long margaret brennan so in in terms of your concerns about an economic slowdown it sounds like you don t see one happening but you did mention espionage there you ve been raising concerns about chinese investment in your home state what exactly is happening here what are you trying to put the brakes on sen manchin well it s not the breaks i i m i encourage investments i want your capital investment made in my state we welcome any country that wants to come make investments but just take our raw material out such as our ethane propane and butanes for building stocks manufacturing stocks and export every bit of that that leaves us with nothing and no building blocks for us to re have a reemergence of manufacturing base i think that s wrong and anything i said is reciprocating we should be reciprocating with countries that basic reciprocate with us go to over to china and try to use their resources and bring them to america do any of that other than manufactured goods they want to sell to us but their resources or their grid system or any of that is off limits why should we give them an entree to ours which basically makes it extremely hard for us extremely hard margaret brennan i want to ask you about gun control you ve been trying since back in 2013 to get this bill that would tighten background checks the bill known as manchin toomey passed you ve spoken to the president this time will he go out there and twist arms to get republicans onboard with this bill sen manchin well when i drafted that bill in 2013 and then pat came on as my partner and we worked that bill it was basically around law abiding gun owners law abiding gun owners will do the right thing but when it comes to background checks if you go to a commercial transaction such as at a gun show internet or any other where you don t know the person common sense or gun sense should tell you should have a background check president trump has a golden opportunity truly a golden opportunity to make so start making america safe again make america safe again by starting with his basic building block of background checks margaret brennan but has the president agreed to go out there and get the republican caucus to support this bill there s no promise it s going to be voted on anytime soon sen manchin right well let me just say this it s been very encouraging with the dialogue going back and forth and all the people meeting and all of the staffs working together trying to find a pathway forward i can t tell you the end result i can t tell you what the final product will be but we re working in a most common sense procedure of what we can get the votes for to do something that truly starts making america safe again and we have we have a responsibility people are afraid to go out communities or let their children go to different types of things that would be a gathering of more than a couple of people and they re concerned about this and we shouldn t be living in fear in america america should be safe and we can do that margaret brennan well we had the republican whip from the house steve scalise on this program just last week and he said we have the tools we need there were background checks already passed fix nics as it s called and what you re proposing he wasn t championing he was basically saying it s already been done you just got to implement it better sen manchin i just respectfully disagree with steve i like him he s a good person we just had disagreements on this and we can do more i come from a gun culture i m a gun owner no one s going to take my guns away i m going to protect the second amendment i m a law abiding gun owner i ll do the right thing but i can tell you if i go to a gun show if i go on the internet and somebody wants to buy my gun and i don t know who they are i ve been taught not to sell my gun to a stranger to someone that has criminal background someone is not mentally stable these are things that that we re going to make those decisions but when you don t know somebody don t you think you can at least come to that agreement that that makes sense and there s so many other good things have been brought to the table you know the red flag bill that lindsey graham and a lot of us are working on makes sense that if we can identify and get somebody help before they do something some horrible tragedy should be done and we have the ability to do these things that really make sense margaret brennan but no promise to you personally by president trump that this is the bill he wants to see passed sen manchin there s no promise on any of this right now it s just open but we have maragret brennan got it sen manchin good dialogue we haven t had this before we re working we have working groups together margaret brennan okay sen manchin and he says he s very encouraged he wants something to happen and i ve said president trump this is yours it doesn t happen unless you stand up and you have a bill that you basically support and this is your piece of legislation and it should be a gun sense bill that makes sense to all gun owners margaret brennan well the only way legislation gets passed is if senators are here in washington working on it there s some questions about whether you re staying or going back to west virginia to run for governor are you going to stay and fight sen manchin well i m going to be fighting that s for sure no matter what happens i m going to be here fighting that s for darn sure but right now margaret brennan and here in washington sen manchin i ll make a decision i ll make a decision basically right after labor day here i ll make a decision and i will announce to the people in west virginia i ve had a lot of inquiries they want me to come back home i have people think that maybe i should stay and i ve had it both ways we re looking at it and i want to do what i can to help my state of west virginia it s always been about west virginia for me margaret brennan last time we spoke with you you just got back from a trip to the arctic you went to greenland i m wondering what you think about this idea of acquiring it sen manchin well greenland s a cold place but it s melting you know we saw we saw the effects of of of global climate changes changes are happening and the people up there understand that and they re trying to adjust to it and we have a very strategic base up there a military base which we we visited and i understand that the strategic logic for that in that part of the world in the arctic opening up the way it is now so that was a very interesting proposal that was thrown out but we haven t heard much about it i m on armed services and we should be getting a secured briefing pretty soon on that margaret brennan on purchasing greenland sen manchin well if that s what if that s the intent if it has any merit to it we ll margaret brennan okay sen manchin we ll hear about it i haven t heard that i just heard basically what s been reported on the news margaret brennan all right senator we ll stay tuned for that decision after labor day thank you very much sen
