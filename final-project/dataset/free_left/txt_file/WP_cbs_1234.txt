after twenty five years they pretty much have this routine down but at riverdance you keep dibby dibby dubby dubbing until you get it absolutely right padraic moyles is putting the dancers through their paces ahead of a big night for the show that turned irish dancing into a world wide hit they re back where it all began back for their anniversary gala on the same stage in dublin where riverdance became an unlikely accidental show biz phenomenon back with a group of dancers who weren t even alive 25 years ago and back with a new star a flaming haired 22 year old named amy mae dolan who looks like she was born for it it s really hard to remember the first time i watched riverdance or even heard the music because it s literally been a part of my every day since i was born dolan said my parents love it you can t remember world where there wasn t riverdance asked correspondent mark phillips no that s it i was obsessed with it it was just all i knew and all i wanted to do it was three years before dolan danced her way into this world that jean butler and michael flatley stomped their way to international fame during the 1994 eurovision song contest tv extravaganza held that year in dublin when the last heel hit the floor the place went crazy and when it finished there was this primal roar as four thousand people as one they jumped to their feet said john mccolgan who with his wife moya doherty produced that original six minute and forty second riverdance number and the applause i think lasted four minutes so we knew certainly at that time what we had suspected could happen would happen it was the beginning of the next quarter century of their lives mccolgan said then the question was almost the next day how do we turn this into a full blown two hour show and have it ready for next year and how do you do that with a great deal of speed quickly and a certain amount of panic doherty laughed if there was any doubt the show would work at full length it didn t last long when the run sold out in dublin they thought they d try it in london it sold out there too and was brought back for a second sell out run even though its star dancer and choreographer michael flately had stomped out of the company by then in a contract dispute he sent us a contract with a list of 40 demands that were absolutely impossible to fulfill said mccolgan so we held the line and it was a bit like poker he didn t think we would but we did that s a bit of a risk he was your star phillips said i think it was a risk doherty said but we had to have a firm belief in the strength of the work we were tested sooner than would ve liked but we had no option and where better to test it than at radio city music hall in new york we did two weeks which is a big gamble in radio city mccolgan said but again we did so well that we came back and we played radio city for six weeks phillips said the london audience the radio city audience in new york these weren t all the offspring of irish immigrants that were coming in something happened what happened was the show took off at its peak it had three separate companies touring europe the americas and asia amy mae dolan said i think it gave irish people confidence it was like we have something that s very unique and special and dare i say sexy to present to the world and it allowed dancers to start traveling and bring a little bit of ireland to places like china australia japan that maybe it hadn t been to before and it s borrowed traditions from places it s been this is what happens when irish step meets american tap mcclogan said i wanted the show to say that we support each other and we borrow from each other giving and receiving from each other culturally and we respect each other doherty added and broaden the appeal as well phillips said absolutely said dogherty it is entertainment it s all a long way from irish dancing s roots in pubs where the bands still play on a saturday night and where the floorboards still take a beating why this style all flashing feet and stiff arms by your side there s one popular theory the catholic priests in ireland just felt like that was more religious you know that kind of stance said dolan and boys and girls didn t touch each other when they were dancing said phillips yeah yeah nobody had an expression while they were dancing just their feet were moving boy are their feet moving the only way to really see what the dancers are doing is to go to the slow motion replay where the level of synchronized perfection is even more evident to complete the circle the riverdance 25th anniversary show comes back to radio city in new york this week and apparently it won t end there phillips asked do you see an end to this or is this gonna stomp its way into the foreseeable future well i have booked this venue for the 50th anniversary laughed mcclogan doherty added the optimist for more info story produced by mikaela bufano editor brian robbins watch
