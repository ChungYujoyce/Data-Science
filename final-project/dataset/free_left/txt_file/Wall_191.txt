advertisement supported by about new york in a stirring ragged ritual the students took their oaths as new doctors early volunteering in the war against covid 19 by jim dwyer transcript congratulations doctors congratulations from dorm rooms and apartments 52 medical students watched video of themselves roll across their screens miles away their proud families followed online gazing into webcams the students pledged the hippocratic oath in frayed unison dozens of different starts and voices all coming to the same point they could get on with doctoring on friday a virtual graduation was held over video chat for nearly half the 2020 class at new york university s grossman school of medicine they were two months ahead of schedule that moment will be repeated in some form at other medical schools in the coming days the more ragged the ritual the more soul stirring its core young people were stepping up to join others already serving at an hour of crisis little different than soldiers being deployed in war the country needs to mobilize people said dr steven abramson vice dean of the grossman school last time this happened was in world war ii when medical schools were shortened to three years celebrate the students today remember too that they stand as proxies for an entire caste of the essential doctors nurses and technicians of course but also those who drive buses pick up garbage save lives in ambulances stock grocery shelves deliver mail push bins of dirty sheets down corridors keep the electricity grid humming and the sewer system flowing and figure out how to make space in hospitals when none is left among unnamed others people have been showing up in the hospital from day one and working so hard said allison horan a medical student who urged n y u to get her class into the fight the students were pulled out of hospitals last month when the disease took off and would have little to do until summer when they will begin a year as interns at hospitals around the country prodded by ms horan and others the school surveyed the class of 120 to find out how many wanted to begin a short term stint of work in new york right away backstopping doctors treating coronavirus patients within 12 hours dr abramson said they had enough volunteers 52 was the final count to move ahead most of those did not live with especially vulnerable people it was a really easy decision to do this evan gerber 26 said you have a moral obligation to society i sent my mom a text n y u is drafting medical students to help fight covid mark s cort 26 said she immediately called me she knows i m pretty hardheaded she made sure that i knew she loved me and that she would be praying for me if they are saying they need more foot soldiers dr horan said i m here to help it was a spirit echo of a moment 17 years ago when hundreds of soldiers from the 101st airborne of the united states army gathered in a giant hangar at fort campbell ky before they boarded planes for the invasion of iraq the national leadership had deemed it a worthy cause a decision many saw or came to see as wrong but what started true and stayed true was the impulse of those men and women to serve many were in their early 20s the chaplain posted a warning sign for anyone trying to rush a big decision i don t marry privates and i don t marry teenagers the troops queued to get inoculated against anthrax and smallpox leaned over tables to designate life insurance beneficiaries and puzzled out standardized wills documents few had ever encountered with variations the same hectic spell landed on the new doctors dr gerber who will move to the denver health medical center in colorado at the end of his covid 19 service in new york was packing boxes last week so he d be ready to throw them in a car and drive west when the time came updated may 12 2020 there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others this is a difficult question because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained a better question might be how will we know when to reopen the country in an american enterprise institute report scott gottlieb caitlin rivers mark b mcclellan lauren silvis and crystal watson staked out four goal posts for recovery hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested it seems to spread very easily from person to person especially in homes hospitals and other confined spaces the pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out it may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face no clinical trials are underway in the united states china and europe but american officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away unlike the flu there is no known treatment or vaccine and little is known about this particular virus so far it seems to be more lethal than the flu but the numbers are still uncertain and it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions not just those with respiratory diseases particularly hard if the family member doesn t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms while also keeping as much distance as possible according to guidelines issued by the c d c if there s space the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if masks are available both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters doorknobs toilets and tables don t forget to wash your hands frequently plan two weeks of meals if possible but people should not hoard food or supplies despite the empty shelves the supply chain remains strong and remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea that s not a good idea even if you re retired having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation or even grows makes sense but retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years watching your balance go up and down can be scary you may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions don t if your employer matches any part of your contributions make sure you re at least saving as much as you can to get that free money the early graduates have agreed to work for 30 days in one of four hospitals affiliated with n y u with optional two week extensions when they are done they will have to quarantine for two weeks dr cort born in guyana raised in brooklyn and the first in his family to go to college was organizing paperwork for the hospital of the university of pennsylvania where he will be an intern he had not seen his mother or grandmother since he convinced them to stay home last month of course the new doctors were afraid of the virus it would be insane not to feel fear dr horan said but they had faith in their training as they rotated through the major medical disciplines in the hospital they used the gowns masks and gloves now known to the world as personal protective equipment i will have to use my p p e carefully dr cort said the young soldiers of the 101st packed ballistic helmets and kevlar vests even so the very first of their number to fall in iraq was a 20 year old soldier wearing helmet and vest a bullet struck under his arm a lethal shot that found an unprotected opening fastidious as the new doctors may be this disease or another may find a way to infect them if i get covid i get covid said dr cort whose family had little money when he was growing up those are things that i can t really control on paper the new doctors are to avoid direct care of covid 19 patients but an axiom of military planning applies equally to medicine the enemy gets a vote one day in the desert of southern iraq an army commander made a prophetic understatement the enemy we re fighting is a bit different than the one we war gamed against and so it is for the new doctors no one can say with certainty what they will be called to do they are joining legions of essentials in serving an empire of need i m signing up dr horan said with the understanding that i m here to help and to serve however is needed advertisement
