advertisement supported by by maggie haberman it has been his pride and his palace a soaring black skyscraper overlooking manhattan that seemed to match donald j trump s ambition and ostentatiousness but trump tower since friday afternoon has become a kind of lonely fortress for its most famous occupant who holes up inside increasingly isolated and upset denounced almost every hour by another republican official mr trump was asked to stay away from a party gathering saturday afternoon in wisconsin where speaker paul d ryan and other state luminaries took the stage a striking rebuke that left the republican nominee for president with no place to go on a saturday 31 days before the election here s how we analyzed in real time the second presidential debate between hillary clinton and donald j trump so he remained inside his enormous penthouse apartment on the 66th floor and his corporate suite 40 stories below for almost all of friday and saturday at times he was joined by his small circle of loyalists who arrived to prepare him for sunday night s debate against hillary clinton but instead spent much of the time trying to figure out how to undo the damage wrought by the surfacing of an 11 year old video recording on which he can be heard gleefully describing pushing himself on women and sexually assaulting them at other times mr trump retreated to twitter where he retweeted posts from an account that says it belongs to a woman who had long ago accused bill clinton of rape mr trump called a few reporters but lacked his usual gusto and he kept returning to watching coverage on cnn the cable outlet he derides as biased against him but still tunes in to most often and becoming more upset as he saw republican officials condemn him one by one reporters for the new york times fact checked the statements made by hillary clinton and donald j trump during sunday s presidential debate mr trump has been rattled by the release of the 2005 video recording according to two people with direct knowledge of his mood who were granted anonymity to candidly describe the situation he was urged to be humble and he felt that he had been in an apology video that his campaign released early saturday but he was criticized for ending his statement with a dig at the clintons and for not apologizing to his wife melania in his remarks to him the criticism was an affirmation that nothing he can say or do would reduce the hostility directed his way according to one of the people with knowledge of how he feels inside the tower on saturday different plans of action were discussed mr trump and his advisers considered a joint television interview that he and ms trump would give to a major network an echo of the 1992 appearance by the clintons on 60 minutes after gennifer flowers claimed that she had had an affair with mr clinton the deliberations over a possible interview were moving ahead despite ms trump s lack of interest in appearing on camera but then nancy o dell the former access hollywood host whom mr trump had lewdly described in the recording issued a statement denouncing his comments and then more tapes of mr trump speaking crudely about women this time on the howard stern show turned up on television which statements caused republicans to bail on donald trump the discussions about the interview were quickly dropped mr trump s son in law jared kushner an observant jew who normally does not work on the sabbath was among those who gathered with him on saturday although the candidate s oldest daughter ivanka was not mr trump s oldest son donald jr was there gov chris christie of new jersey and rudolph w giuliani also showed up as did the republican national committee chairman reince priebus mr christie and mr priebus told mr trump that the situation with other republicans was becoming dire other advisers assured mr trump that attacking mrs clinton over her husband s behavior with women and over reports that she had defended his behavior would help rally republicans again ms trump and the rest of the trump family made plans to travel with the candidate to the debate in part to buoy his spirits but the real source of comfort to mr trump seemed to be the small band of supporters waving trump signs on the fifth avenue sidewalk outside the building his fans clashed with people walking by including a woman who told a female trump supporter that she should go back to her trailer mr trump could not resist the scene just before 5 p m he descended from what his aides grandly call the residence and strode through the marbled lobby with his son and his campaign manager kellyanne conway in tow he slipped through the glass front door startling some of his star struck supporters the crowd screamed and reached out to touch his suit jacket he bathed in the rapturous admiration he pumped his right fist in the air and smiled he looked rejuvenated he stayed for just five minutes electrifying the scene but before he departed one reporter screamed a question at him asking whether he would remain in the race hundred percent mr trump replied he turned and headed back to the tower clapping his hands as if to applaud his supporters and himself advertisement
