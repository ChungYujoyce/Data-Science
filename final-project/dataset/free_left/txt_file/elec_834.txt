reserve by s v d te february 19 2015 s v d te is white house correspondent for national journal and author of jeb america s next bush follow him on twitter at svdate s v d te is white house correspondent for national journal and author of jeb america s next bush follow him on twitter at svdate sure every campaign s goal is to make you want to have a beer with the candidate but what if the candidate doesn t particularly want to have a beer with you that in a nutshell could well be the single biggest challenge facing the embryonic jeb bush for president campaign not common core not immigration reform not his last name but a grueling 600 plus day slog that requires shaking thousands of hands and chatting with countless voters all over the country when the candidate in question would just as soon disappear into a book advertisement voters got a glimpse of jeb the introvert this week the problem was not that he wasn t ready for prime time it was that he looked as if he didn t want to be near prime time delivering a much touted speech in chicago to lay out his foreign policy vision bush tripped over himself repeated words rushed through high points that should have been allowed to resonate in eager ears and added long pauses in inappropriate places describing his comfort with foreign travel he said he had forced himself to visit asia four times a year no doubt confusing some viewers who would love even one chance to visit the continent that jeb bush is not an especially social person is no secret to those who know him and bush himself put it out there for the record last month in san francisco at the national auto dealers association convention i m an introvert he said his host nada chairman forrest mcconnell had asked bush to tell the 4 000 assembled car salespeople something they didn t know about him and mcconnell seemed surprised by the answer well because i ve overcome it bush continued and i would rather read a book than go out and get in a conga line and go dancing but i learned that in order to make your case or in order to serve or in order to advance a cause you have to connect with people and you can t connect with people if you re back in the corner reading a book you have to engage with people look em in the eye connect with them on a human level understand where they re coming from before you get a chance to lay out your plan right but if bush would like everyone to think that he has overcome past tense his unease in social settings his chicago performance suggests that a more accurate response might be he continues to overcome it present tense and that could be problem with a food fight of a republican primary already starting and a gop base that s demanding fire and inspiration from its presidential contenders what we know about the former florida governor and only technically not yet 2016 presidential candidate is this he likes policy discussions he likes to read and fire off emails he likes to play golf but getting up in front of hundreds or thousands of people in a civic auditorium or even making nice with a dozen people at an elks lodge in des moines or manchester we really can t say even now has jeb bush overcome his natural reserve based on his record it would be foolish to underestimate his determination and clearly it is possible to overstate the importance of being able to connect with audiences through speeches as opposed to debates or question and answer sessions where bush excels possibly because his competitive instinct lets him see those exchanges as personal challenges richard nixon one of the most personally awkward politicians of modern times was also one of the most successful at least until he wasn t the vast majority of americans including those in swing states will cast a ballot in november 2016 without ever having seen any of the candidates in person what s more a host of other qualities are also vital for the modern presidential campaign the most important of which is probably the ability to raise large amounts of money what started as a family campaign donor list a half century ago with index cards kept in barbara bush s recipe box has over the decades grown into a proven cash juggernaut and second son jeb now holds its keys further a presidential campaign is an enormous enterprise an organizational nightmare in this respect also jeb bush has a huge advantage over his rivals he has been integrally involved in four national campaigns for his dad and two for his brother this would be his seventh where he is lacking is in those far more basic ingredients in a politician the craving for validation and the thrill of the performance politicians as a breed often have a desire even a need to be liked even nixon did they run for student council and for class president at an age when those offices mean close to zero and steadily build from that to city commission state legislature and onward at the same time they bask in the spotlight and enjoy putting on a show for their fans think texas sen ted cruz s and wisconsin gov scott walker s appearances at last month s freedom summit bush has never been that politician as a teen he felt out of sorts and out of place at andover years later he called himself a cynical little turd during those boarding school years his first attempt at elective office was governor of florida not because he wanted floridians to adore him but because he had a vision of how florida ought to be and the best way to make that vision a reality was to become its governor this uncompromising doggedness has obvious implications for governance style but leave that aside for now to focus on how it might play in a five or eight or 10 candidate gop primary particularly in retail heavy states like iowa and new hampshire where voters have come to expect direct in my neighbor s living room campaigning bush s cerebral matter of fact style could be less than inspirational at a time when the party is looking for just that more fundamentally just the need to win over affection in the first place will be a long tack into uncharted waters for bush never before has he had to wow potential voters as opposed to donors even as he started his first run for governor in 1993 he was treated like a rock star admired just for being the son of george h w and barbara bush sure liberal democrats disliked him because of his surname but they made up a smaller minority in florida two decades ago than they do today but with everybody else bush was generally given the benefit of the doubt it made his four republican primary opponents crazy jim smith was the elected secretary of state and had been attorney general in the 1980s he was making his second run for governor and probably would have been the gop nominee were it not for bush his campaign put together a david letterman style list of the top 10 ways bush made his millions among them pawned his silver spoon managed the white house rose garden for an increase in his allowance did not invest in brother neil s silverado savings and loan and the no 1 reason had great foresight in selecting his parents bush s off the shelf popularity extended to fundraising especially when he had his parents in tow in one notable long weekend bush raised 1 1 million in it should be noted 500 increments which was what his top three rivals raised combined that whole quarter i knew jeb bush was going to be running for governor smith told reporters afterward i didn t know his mom and dad would be too bush won that primary easily nearly receiving an outright majority smith conceded rather than face a runoff yes bush wound up losing by a razor thin margin that november to incumbent democrat and living florida legend lawton chiles but he never came close to defeat again in 1998 the state republican party worked to clear the field for bush to make sure he didn t have to waste time with a primary and in 2002 he was the sitting governor and brother of the sitting president should he continue forward with a campaign and there is no indication that he will not this time will be very different first of course is the structure if bush was not particularly strong among republicans in jacksonville or tallahassee in his 1994 primary it was not cause for great concern because he was running strong in miami and most of north florida and everybody voted on the same day it was not necessary for bush to win over voters specifically in those places he was least popular the presidential nominating system is obviously very different doing poorly in both iowa and new hampshire could spell the end of his campaign unless he can rally voters even if he s likely to do very well a few weeks later in florida georgia and texas and it s in those early states particularly iowa where the most conservative wing of his party which also happens to be home to the most reliable primary voters deeply mistrusts him in 1994 bush s name was golden among the most conservative voters in florida a year and a half into bill clinton s presidency the state s republicans had forgiven george h w bush s failings and were eager to give his son a chance to redeem the family name two decades later that family name probably creates as much drag as it does lift the base of his party is wary of the son of bush 41 and the brother of bush 43 possibly more so than even independents and persuadable democrats the most cited issues are immigration and the common core education standards both of which the would be bush 45 has supported and continues to support several of his likely rivals for the 2016 republican nomination are already using these to take potshotsat bush and the ganging up will no doubt intensify after the first fundraising numbers are released and likely show bush with an advantage in the tens of millions of dollars on top of all this it s been a long time since his last campaigns as the other 2016 ers are eager to point out more than a decade has elapsed since jeb bush made certain that brother george w would win florida without needing a recount and it s been a dozen years since bush last faced voters himself what had been a fast responding nimble campaign back then would be considered sluggish in the age of twitter while the 2004 george w bush reelection campaign was state of the art in its voter data and turnout operation its methods were made obsolete by the obama campaigns of 2008 and 2012 in reality though there s probably less to this last concern than meets the eye after all the jeb bush campaigns transitioned easily and without much drama from faxing rapid responses in 1994 to emailing them in 1998 bush was tech savvy in his 40s and 50s he was spending hours on his laptop emailing when that was still relatively new and was an early adopter to handhelds when the blackberry came along there s little reason to think this comfort level has evaporated just because he is now in his 60s more to the point it s not as if bush personally has to write code for his campaign apps or spend hours each day on twitter responding to rand paul s taunts the chief tech officer of bush s right to rise pac was forced to resign recently over inflammatory twitter and blogging comments but that aside it won t be terribly difficult for bush to hire his own cadre of 20 somethings to craft withering retorts to the insults concocted by paul s 20 somethings and with 50 million or 70 million or 100 million in the bank after just three months of fundraising bush will likely be able to hire as much staff as he needs to out organize and out message his republican rivals just as he was able to do in 1994 in fact this full speed ahead fundraising sprint provides the most important clue to what makes bush such a formidable candidate bush s declaration in december that he was actively exploring a presidential candidacy might have been reasonably interpreted as signaling a period of fact finding to be followed at some point by a decision on whether to run but close observers and floridians knew better bush does not do half measures and sure enough the tentative sounding language was almost immediately followed by a blitz of near daily fundraisers all over the country including a handful with a 100 000 per person price of admission this dash from zero to 90 appears to have caught his rivals flat footed it s difficult to see how any of them can come anywhere near his total by the end of the first quarter which will leave them in the unenviable position of having to argue either that money doesn t matter or that bush s advantage is short lived it s that single mindedness that brute force of will that has enabled bush to overcome adversity including the adversity of his own personal reluctance to unveil himself in the summer of 1994 it took him on a six day 28 city 50 eventmotor home swing leading into the republican primary a breakfast speech luncheon remarks a couple of local government photo ops a rubber chicken dinner capped off with a near midnight arrival at a motel in the next town on the list only to do it all over again the following morning there were a number of these forced marches that year in addition to the more typical two event days on the other weeks and all of this because in the end jeb bush wanted to be governor more than he needed his solitude his full on sprint this winter suggests he s made a similar decision about the presidency the big difference of course is that in 1994 the primary voters he was speaking to mostly were predisposed to like him in iowaand new hampshire today that is not the case those who start out disliking himoutnumber those who are ready to make him the republican nominee most of the rest are skeptical and so it will come down to this the force of bush s will to make these people like and support him versus their early inclination not to how this turns out is not knowable but given his track record the safer bet is probably on bush even an introverted one california by jeremy b white updated 05 08 20 09 44 pm edt by sam sutton and carly sitrin by bill mahoney and josh gerstein updated 03 29 20 02 48 pm edt
