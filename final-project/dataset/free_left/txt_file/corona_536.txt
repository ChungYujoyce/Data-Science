advertisement supported by the new new world the doctor li wenliang had been silenced by the police after warning about the new coronavirus that has killed hundreds in china and sickened thousands by li yuan they posted videos of the les mis rables song do you hear the people sing they invoked article no 35 of china s constitution which stipulates freedom of speech they tweeted a phrase from for whom the bell tolls the chinese public has staged what amounts to an online revolt after the death of a doctor li wenliang who tried to warn of a mysterious virus that has since killed hundreds of people in china infected tens of thousands and forced the government to corral many of the country s 1 4 billion people since late thursday people from different backgrounds including government officials prominent business figures and ordinary online users have posted numerous messages expressing their grief for the doctor who contracted the new coronavirus and their anger over his silencing by the police after he shared his knowledge about the virus it has prompted a nationwide soul searching under an authoritarian government that allows for little dissent i haven t seen my wechat timeline filled with so much forlornness and outrage xu danei founder of a social media analytics company wrote on the messaging platform wechat tonight is a monumental moment for our collective conscience he wrote in a later post though there are some outspoken dissidents in china their numbers have dwindled as the communist party under the leader xi jinping has cracked down repeatedly on lawyers journalists and businesspeople over the past seven years in this highly censored society it s rare for ordinary people to make demands and openly express anger toward the government it s even more rare for officials and heads of big corporations to show emotions that can be interpreted as discontent with the state after speculation of dr li s death began swirling online thursday evening the communist party s propaganda machine went into full gear trying to control the message but it didn t seem as effective as it had in the past the outpouring of messages online from sad infuriated and grieving people was too much for the censors the government even seemed to recognize the magnitude of the country s emotion dispatching a team to investigate what it called issues related to dr li wenliang that were reported by the public though without specifics for many people in china the doctor s death shook loose pent up anger and frustration at how the government mishandled the situation by not sharing information earlier and by silencing whistle blowers it also seemed to those online that the government hadn t learned lessons from previous crises continuing to quash online criticism and investigative reports that provide vital information some users of weibo china s twitter like social media platform are saying the doctor s death resonated because he was an ordinary person who was forced to admit to wrongdoing for doing the right thing dr li was reprimanded by the police after he shared concerns about the virus in a social messaging app with medical school classmates on dec 30 three days later the police compelled him to sign a statement that his warning constituted illegal behavior the doctor eventually went public with his experiences and gave interviews to help the public better understand the unfolding epidemic the new york times interviewed dr li days before his death he didn t want to become a hero but for those of us in 2020 he had reached the upper limit of what we can imagine a hero would do one weibo post read the post is one of many that users say they wrote out of shame and guilt for not standing up to an authoritarian government as dr li did many people posted a variation of a quote he who holds the firewood for the masses is the one who freezes to death in wind and snow the original version of the saying came from the chinese writer murong xuecun about seven years ago when he and some friends were raising money for the families of political prisoners it was written as a reminder to people that it was in their interest to support those who dared to stand up to authority many of those people had frozen to death figuratively speaking as fewer people were willing to publicly support these dissenting figures the atmosphere was very different on thursday evening as confusion mounted about dr li s fate people accused the authorities of trying to delay announcing his death the grief was so widespread that it appeared in unlikely corners refusing to listen to your whistling your country has stopped ticking and your heart has stopped beating hong bing the shanghai bureau chief of the communist party s official newspaper people s daily wrote on her timeline on wechat an instant messaging platform how big a price do we have to pay to make you and your whistling sound louder to reach every corner of the east both the chinese and english language twitter accounts of people s daily tweeted that dr li s death had prompted national grief both accounts deleted those messages before replacing them with more neutral official sounding posts the weibo account of shandong province s law enforcement body posted a portrait of dr li with two sentences that have been circulating online heroes don t fall from the sky they re just ordinary people who stepped forward wang gaofei the chief executive of weibo which carries out many of the orders passed down from china s censors pondered what lessons china should learn from dr li s death we should be more tolerant of people who post untruthful information that aren t malicious he said in a post if we re only allowed to speak what we can guarantee is fact we re going to pay prices even the official wechat account of a quantum physics blog wrote a post headlined li wenliang you only went to the parallel universe on social media many people urged the government to make dr li a martyr and hold a state funeral attended by the nation s leaders it s the first time my screen is full of one person s name wrote zheng wenxin a lawyer it s the first time this nation held a state funeral for a doctor r i p our hero fan bao a prominent tech investor posted on his wechat timeline for some it was a lesson about the importance of free speech one the government didn t understand beijing has increased its censorship over investigative reports that have exposed missteps by officials who underestimated and played down the threat from the coronavirus china s top leaders stepped up efforts to make the news coverage focus more on positive developments in the battle against the epidemic the hashtag wewantfreedomofspeech was created on weibo at 2 a m on friday and had over two million views and over 5 500 posts by 7 a m it was deleted by censors along with related topics such as ones saying the wuhan government owed dr li an apology i love my country deeply read one post under that topic but i don t like the current system and the ruling style of my country it covered my eyes my ears and my mouth updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities the writer of the post complained about not being able to gain access to the internet beyond the great firewall i ve been holding back for a long time i feel we ve all been holding back for a long time it erupted today talking about freedom of speech on the chinese internet is taboo even though it s written into the constitution so it s a small miracle that the freedom of speech hashtag survived for over five hours the country s high powered executives have been less blunt but have echoed the same sentiments online it s time to reflect on the deeply rooted stability trumps everything thinking that s hurt everyone wang ran chairman of the investment bank cec capital wrote on weibo we all want stability he asked will you be more stable if you cover the others mouths while walking on a tightrope gao xiaosong an alibaba executive posted on his weibo account that he hoped china would enact a whistle blower protection act seemingly in reference to the american law so that more people could speak out r i p our hero thank you he wrote of dr li some proposed that people in china sound their car horns at 9 30 p m on friday in the doctor s memory while it s not clear whether that happened many around the country blew whistles at 9 p m and posted photos of candles on their social media timelines 30 minutes later they have also urged the simultaneous posting of a hashtag of the two questions the police asked dr li to answer in a statement can you stop your illegal behavior and do you understand you ll be punished if you don t stop such behavior dr li had been forced to respond in writing i can and i understand putting his red thumbprint on top of them it s too early to tell whether the online anger and frustration will amount to much there was palpable public outrage in a few past tragedies including a 2008 earthquake in sichuan province and a train accident in 2011 but it faded in those instances some people in china are more hopeful this time in those past tragedies many people could stay out of them said hou zhihui a commentator who has been detained twice for his online speeches but this time nobody can stay out of it it s impossible advertisement
