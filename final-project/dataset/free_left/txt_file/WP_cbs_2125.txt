sexual assault against him according tocbs news campaign reporter bo ericksonandcbsnews com political reporter grace segers the presumptive democratic presidential nominee has been accused of sexual harassment and sexual assault by a former senate staffer tara reade biden s campaign has denied the allegations although biden himself has not directly addressed them i do support joe biden i m satisfied with how he has responded pelosi said in an interview with cnn s new day sheannounced her endorsementof biden on monday cnn pressed pelosi on biden s own public silence so far in the face of the allegations you know it s a matter that he has to deal with but i am impressed with the people who work for him saying that they absolutely never heard one iota of information about this nobody ever brought forth a claim or had anybody else tell them about such a claim pelosi replied pelosi reiterated her support for biden in her weekly press conference thursday saying that she has complete respect for the me too movement but that she also believes in due process there is due process and the fact that joe biden is joebiden pelosi told reporters noting that his senate staff had been interviewed and there was no record of reade s accusation republicans have been calling on the release of biden s senate records in the belief that an official complaint from reade will be in there i have a great comfort level with the situation as i see it pelosi said meanwhile the republican house campaign arm kept inboxes full on thursday using the sexual assault allegations against biden to call out targeted house democrats and candidates in almost 30 email blasts the national republican congressional committee bring up a lack of input from a lawmaker on the issue or past comments about sexual assault during the heat of the brett kavanaugh hearings a lot of them went on the record demanding survivors be heard demanding survivors be given a safe place to voice their traumatic issues that have happened to them national republican congressional committee spokesperson michael mcadams toldcbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro and now they are turning a blind eye to that and completely going back on what they said because the person that the allegations are against is a democrat like other democrats congresswoman dina titus one of biden s earlier endorsers toldnavarroshe didn t think the allegations would have an impact on down ballot races i m a strong supporter of the metoo movement every woman needs to tell her story and have it vetted i believe it s been thoroughly vetted and all you have to do is look at his record on violence against women the other things to show where he stands on this she said from the candidates joe biden cbs news has spoken with tara reade several times since she publicized her allegation against joe biden on march 25 since that time biden over the past 36 days has not directly addressed reade s claim cbs news campaign reporter bo ericksonreports while his campaign has called the allegation untrue biden has yet to respond directly tonight msnbc announcedthat biden himself would respond to the sexual assault allegation for the first time on morning joe on friday morning biden s lack of response has also left other high profile democrats in a tough and frustrating spot several democratic operatives tell cbs news senators kamala harris and amy klobuchar along with stacey abrams and governor gretchen whitmer have all been asked in interviews about the allegation but biden s recent sparse schedule of interviews has not afforded many opportunities to ask him directly his team for the past two weeks has prioritized local interviews and the campaign has not held a virtual press conference with his usual traveling press corps since april 2 for some democratic operatives the focus on the allegation and biden s silence is overshadowing his campaign messaging regarding the new unemployment numbers

the outbreak this would also include providing weekly data on patient outcomes disaggregated by race and ethnicity the bill would also report to congress the structural inequalities preceding the

the bill s passage we need to radically increase our supply of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies to attack the coronavirus crisis head on we have an administration that is failing to lead and failing to ensure health care providers and patients have the resources they need warren said the bill has the support of several progressive and medical groups including the center for american progress and doctors for america but similar proposals from warren and schakowsky in the past have failed to gain traction gretchen whitmer republicans in the michigan house of representatives took additional steps to limit democratic governor gretchen whitmer s executive emergency powers on thursday according tocbs news campaign reporters adam brewsterandjack turman the house also did not extend michigan s state of emergency which is set to expire at the end of the day the house passed a resolution that allows speaker of the house lee chatfield to take legal action against whitmer and the actions she has taken during the coronavirus pandemic whitmer has argued that she does not need the legislature s approval to extend a state of emergency but whitmer has indicated that she would like to partner with the legislature to extend the state of emergency in order to provide liability protections for health care workers and first responders protesters gathered at the state capitol in lansing to voice frustrations about the extension of emergency powers democratic state senator dayna polehanki whotweeted a photoof armed protesters in the senate gallery told cbs news that half of the gathering looked like a trump rally and the other half expressed concern about whitmer s stay at home order the differences between the governor and the legislature over executive emergency powers have been simmering over the past week last friday the state senate passed two bills that would limit whitmer s emergency powers whitmer threatened to veto any legislation that would take authority away from her or future governors arguing that executive emergency powers are essential during a crisis the dispute reached a low point on wednesday as emails between whitmer s staff and state senate majority mike shirkey s staff showed that republican legislators proposed two one week extensions to whitmer s emergency powers in exchange for a public agreement that future stay at home orders will require legislative approval whitmer s staff responded with a message from the governor saying i cannot abrogate my duty to act in an emergency to protect the lives of michiganders congressional coverage in the house in special election news democrat tricia zunker running in wisconsin s 7th district was recently endorsed bysenator cory

both districts have their special elections on may 12 though california has switched to an all mail ballot election issues that matter equal rights the senate democratic policy and communications committee on thursday released a report arguing that covid 19 has amplified existing inequalities and discrimination that have impacted communities of color in the report cbs news campaign reporter zak hudaksays dpcc chairwoman debbie stabenow and senate minority leader chuck schumer cite data showing a disproportionate number of coronavirus cases and deaths in people of color the report outlined several measures democrats hope to be included in future coronavirus legislation including guaranteed equitable access to testing across communities emergency rental assistance and an increase in paycheck protection program access in addition to releasing demographic breakdowns for covid 19 testing the report calls for the department of health and human services to establish a commission to study inequalities in coronavirus cases and testing we must do more to help communities of color weather this storm schumer told reporters over the phone this pandemic has heightened many of the terrible health care and economic disparities that communities of color have unfortunately faced for generations jobs more than 30 million americans have filed for unemployment insurance due to the coronavirus pandemic including another 3 8 million americans who filed claims last week according to the labor department since businesses began to close to slow the spread of the virus six weeks ago 30 3 million americans have filed claims but the number is likely higher because many people have struggled to file unemployment insurance as systems have been bogged down by the staggering number of claims cbs news campaign reporter adam brewstersays a survey from theeconomic policy institutefound that for every ten people who successfully filed for benefits another five to six either could not get through to make a claim or didn t try because it was too difficult to do so millions of the newly jobless are going without benefits as the unemployment system buckles under the weight of new claims epi economists ben zipperer and elise gould wrote thursday s labor department report also showed that 12 4 of american workers were receiving unemployment benefits for the week ending april 18 before the pandemic the highest weekly percentage recorded was 7 back in 1975 the peak during the great recession was 5 during two different weeks in may and june of 2009 cost of voting a new report from thebrennan center for justicesays the 400 million congress passed in march to help states cover election costs due to coronavirus is likely far short of what s needed cbs news campaign reporter adam brewstersays the report examined election costs in five states with different systems georgia michigan missouri ohio and pennsylvania it found that election administration costs from covid 19 in those five states alone could cost at least 414 million the congressional grants could cover less than 10 of what georgia officials need and about 18 of what officials in ohio need according to the report the bulk of costs are expected to fall on local officials rather than state governments the report found in ohio and missouri local officials are expected to cover more than 90 of the election costs facing an economic downturn states may soon tighten their belts further on many services the report says the federal government has the resources to ensure that state and local governments can run free fair and safe elections this fall we urge them to do so as soon as possible the brennan centerpreviouslyestimated it could cost 2 billion to secure the november election due to coronavirus but has since said it may cost double that to secure all other elections scheduled this year state by state california the california republican party has filed suit against governor gavin newsom to prohibit the practice of ballot collecting or ballot harvesting during two upcoming special elections in the state arguing it stands in direct conflict with social distancing guidelines and newsom s shelter in place mandate to slow the spread of the coronavirus two weeks ago california republican party chairwomanjessica pattersonsent newsom a letter asking him to halt the practice and clarify that his order prohibits collection of ballots but she said newsom did not respond the governor has dodged his responsibility patterson toldcbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidar we re hoping the courts will compel him to clarify she added newsom s office declined to comment for this story ballot harvesting allows party volunteers or campaign workers to collect mail in ballots from voters and submit them in groups to polling places or election offices in 2016 californiaexpanded the lawto allow any person to collect a mail in ballot prior law restricted the practice to just relatives of those or those living in the same household as the voter california secretary of state alex padilla who is also named in the lawsuit and is currently pushing for a 50 state vote by mail plan ahead of the november presidential election told cbs news this whole debate is nothing but a pretext that republicans use to advance their voter suppression agenda padilla acknowledged yes there are numerous public health directives in place but at the same time there are fundamental voting rights that are in place and must be protected there is no conflict people can reach out to voters and people can exercise multiple ways of voting while respecting public health directives patterson argued that voters aren t leaving their ballots on the front steps and that the practice of ballot harvesting requires an in person hand off she added that would absolutely violate social distancing if someone is coming to your house and picking up that ballot from you and you re signing it over to them wednesday s lawsuit specifically points to upcoming special elections on may 12 in california s 25th congressional district and the 28th state senate district the congressional race for the 25th district is to replace democratkatie hillwho resigned after a sex scandal and a congressional ethics investigation christy smith a democratic state assemblywoman is running against former u s navy fighter pilot and republican businessman mike garcia a spokesperson for smith s campaign told cbs news that due to public health concerns we are not collecting ballots from supporters at this

ballot harvesting drives at their churches as late as april 10 according to emails sent by garcia s campaign manager and obtained by cbs news on april 11 california s stay at home order was extended into may and days later patterson officially sent her letter to newsom asking for clarification a gop official told cbs news a big part of it is you have to prepare the official added you have to prepare for what s coming and whether or it s going to be extended garcia s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment when asked if the national republican congressional committee is okay with garcia s campaign focusing on ballot harvesting efforts despite calls from party leaders to halt the practice nrcc spokeswoman torunn sinclair passed along contact information for newsom s press office and said we will give you an answer just as soon as you get an answer from governor newsom on if this is illegal or not patterson said the california republican party has currently halted
