 after several states on both coasts created regional partnerships that would coordinate on re opening plans donald trump apparently decided his i don t take responsibility at all posture toward the pandemic made him look weak and so the president adopted a radically new position on monday stating his belief that he has the ultimate authority over state decisions regarding the coronavirus crisis the president of the united states calls the shots trump told reporters adding when somebody is the president of the united states the authority is total and that s the way it s going to be it s total it s total and the governors know that they really don t in fact as became clear yesterday practically every fair minded observer from the left right and center could agree on one thing trump s declaration was spectacularly wrong if governors intend to leave stay at home orders in place as the crisis continues the president doesn t have the power to overrule their directives with this reality in mind trump retreated just one day after his bizarre claim this site is protected by recaptchaprivacy policy terms of service president donald trump said tuesday he s fine with governors making their own decisions about how and when to reopen their states a quick retreat from the day before when he insisted that such choices were up to only him because his authority is total i will be authorizing each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their state in a time and a manner as most appropriate trump said he added the governors are going to be opening up their states they re going to declare when they re going to know when i ll confess that i couldn t help but laugh a bit after hearing the president s i will be authorizing phrasing because it was a pitiful attempt at making it seem as if he was maintaining some semblance of control governors who do not work for trump do not need and did not ask for his permission to move forward with re opening plans on their own timelines but trump wants to pretend that his authority is broad and imposing so he presented his retreat yesterday in a self congratulatory way the president has decided to let governors who were going to do their own thing proceed with their own plans how gracious of him to extend leeway to state officials that they already had the hullabaloo trump created on monday has already started to fade but the incident is a reminder of a larger phenomenon he often just blurts stuff out without a lot of thought a few weeks ago for example the president signaled his willingness to abandon the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and re open the nation on easter soon after he retreated around the same time trump said he was poised to impose a two week enforceable quarantine on new york probably new jersey and certain parts of connecticut a few hours later he retreated on that too this week the president claimed powers he did not have over state based stay at home orders leading to yet another retreat it s a reminder that taking trump s rhetoric about his own presidency at face value is rarely a good idea 2020 nbc universal
