percentage point moore spoke from behind a shiny wooden desk with a large statue of someone riding a horse and a decorative lamp in the background in the statement he quoted from abraham lincoln s proclamation in march 1863 for a day of national humiliation fasting and prayer he then transitioned smoothly from lincoln s call for more humility to moore s own proclamation of the ills of the us we

committee said on wednesday the defeat was a blow to donald trump who defied other senior members of his party by backing moore despite the allegations against him on wednesday trump claimed that he had known all along that moore was unelectable which he said was why he initially endorsed his opponent luther strange during alabama s summer republican primary the reason i originally endorsed luther strange and his numbers went up mightily is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election trump wrote i was right roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him in the video moore also alluded to the allegations of sexual misconduct that have been made against him even our political process has been affected with baseless and false allegations which have become more relevant than the issues which affect our country moore said the four minute and 46 second video ends with a white screen wishing viewers a merry christmas and reminding them that the video was paid for by moore s campaign for senate
