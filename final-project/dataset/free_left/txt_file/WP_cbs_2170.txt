the following is a transcript of an interview with former google chairman and ceo eric schmidt that aired sunday may 10 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan we want to go now to the former ceo of google eric schmidt he is leading a new york commission to reimagine sectors of the economy in light of the coronavirus pandemic he joins us from miami this morning good morning to you former google ceo eric schmidt good morning margaret brennan we just heard from one of the white house economic advisers that the worst is yet to come on the unemployment front what jobs in your view will continue to exist schmidt well a lot will but they ll operate in different ways we re gonna have to reimagine how the workplace works we re going to have to figure out how to get people into buildings that they re fearful of my guess is we ll have more demand for office space not less because people will want social distancing we re going to have to think about hub and spoke systems where local people don t travel so far because they don t want to be in public transit for so long so we re gonna have to really rethink how businesses operate they need their employees back margaret brennan after 9 11 in in manhattan you saw people establish homes outside the city you saw businesses move and have backup facilities outside of major cities is there something that we know is in the works this time around schmidt you can be sure that something like that will happen if you think of it as an employer you have a bunch of employees some of whom are dying to get back to the office and some people who are afraid that if they go to the office they will die they re very concerned about they re immunocompromised or what have you so they re going to have to come up with flexible arrangements so imagine that there are three or four people one will go to the office one will stay home someone some will go to some local or near their near their town working environment it will change the pattern we ve had this situation where people move to super cities in these incredibly concentrated ways that will change in the next few years you don t need to be in the super city in order to participate in the ex excitement of these super cities the commission by the way is intending to work not just on the city but also suburban and all the rural folks we have to be sensitive to the fact that everybody has problems everyone has concerns and they re very different situations margaret brennan you know corporations are being forced to try to do things in a different way right now but many of them may use this as an excuse or as an accelerant to make some big strategic shifts what does the economy look like on the other side of it what does that mean schmidt one way to think about this is that this one month two months period has brought forth 10 years of forward change so all of a sudden the internet is no longer optional it s fundamental to doing business to operate to live our lives all sorts of much higher expectations as a result for example we need much better broadband in the rural areas another example will be tele health 80 percent of the visits to doctors are right now in tele health people have been wanting this to happen for years now using remote monitoring we can actually measure everybody and do it remotely and then only if you have to you go in to see the doctor and by the way that s more convenient for you as a as a patient there are all sorts of examples another thing that we ll have to do is we ll have to have all sorts of interesting sort of social monitoring of one kind or another to look for these hotspots so systems will have to be developed to see oh my god there s an outbreak over there let s get to it right now before the spread begins margaret brennan but one of the things that this crisis has also made obvious is not just income disparity but but access to internet as you just said if someone doesn t have access to broadband or they don t have the computer how do you make up for that difference who pays for that schmidt well we have to we have to solve that problem and when the government does another one of these huge stimulus bills let s put some stimulus into broadband access especially for rural areas the cities are in pretty good shape and then let s figure out a way for people who don t otherwise have access to computers through libraries or whatever find a way for them to get access many people can access through their mobile phones that s another solution you can t participate in this new economy without access to the internet it s how you re going to learn it s how you re going to deliver services it s how you re going to market it by the way it s how you re going to sell right so sales people won t be traveling as much they re going to be doing it with the equivalent of zoom and other services like that margaret brennan but it s not just you re talking about federal funding to build out infrastructure like wifi but what we ve learned because of some of these backlogs in unemployment claims with the states is that their basic infrastructure their computers are so outmoded they can t even process the amount of demand right now where does that come from i mean you re talking about re not just rebuilding but you know completely remaking how states function schmidt what you re learning through this is that the government at the federal and state level have just terrible infrastructure in the software department they re still using cobol systems which is a pro system i programmed in 45 years ago and those systems you know the programmers are no longer with us so we ve really got to upgrade these systems and there are much better technologies that are much more secure much quicker and so forth you can see them in the in the private sector the public sector has lagged for whatever set of reasons because of this will accelerate all of that if you look forward to it what you ll do as a citizen is many of your services will be online your health will be online much of your education will be online and then there ll be other systems like we need to figure out a way to de densify public transportation people will say it s better if you get on the subway now because it s less crowded right because you don t want to be on a subway when it s full of everybody these kinds of changes are easy for computer systems to do if they re in place margaret brennan the wall street journal is reporting this morning that the trump administration is in talks with intel and some other companies to move facilities back to the united states to have manufacturing be here do you see that change in the global supply chain happening schmidt well we ve built in the last 10 or 20 years this extraordinarily efficient global supply chain with many many steps we ve now learned that it s not resilient there has been for at least a decade a great concern about our over reliance on taiwan in particular for foreign chip manufacturing and there is an initiative within the government which is very important that we get domestic supply of foundries literally the places where chips are made and companies like intel and samsung and tsmc tsmc is the largest foundry it s in taiwan at the seven nanometre level trying to get them into our country so we have better control it s important from a standpoint of of our own economics it s also important for national security we want to make sure that our critical infrastructure is owned and controlled by america right never bet against america we are the innovators in our world we should be able to do this well margaret brennan we ll leave it on that note never bet against america thank you eric schmidt schmidt thank you margaret brennan we
