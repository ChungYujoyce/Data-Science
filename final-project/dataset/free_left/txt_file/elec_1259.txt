please read our updated privacy notice and terms of use effective on december 19 2019 as some presumably small portion of americans sat through a dull debate between the republican and democratic vice presidential nominees on tuesday night a far more interesting drama was unfolding within the libertarian ticket vp candidate bill weld told the boston globe that he plans to focus on attacking donald trump for the remainder of the campaign essentially admitting that running mate gary johnson can not become president trump has weld s full attention he explained because his agenda is so terrible it s in a class by itself i think mr trump s proposals in the foreign policy area including nuclear proliferation tariffs and free trade would be so hurtful domestically and in the world that he has my full attention weld said apparently he avoided acknowledging that his new mission amounts to working to make hillary clinton president he pointed out that he disagrees with clinton on fiscal and military issues though last week on msnbc he said he s not sure anybody is more qualified than hillary clinton to be president of the united states it s unusual for a candidate to admit defeat five weeks before the election even though johnson is at just 7 4 percent nationally in the real clear politics polling average however weld s move doesn t exactly constitute going rogue since earlier in the day johnson admitted in a cnn interview i guess i wasn t meant to be president the libertarian nominee was trying to argue that his lack of foreign policy knowledge is an asset five days after he was unable to name a world leader he admires johnson described that as another aleppo moment referring to a previous gaffe in which he failed to recognize the name of the besieged syrian city the gaffes led many to say weld should be at the top of the ticket and weld strategists reportedly looked into the possibility of doing that only to be shot down by johnson weld insists that he s not abandoning johnson and that his running mate is fully in support of his strategy shift i have had in mind all along trying to get the donald into third place and with some tugging and hauling we might get there he said however weld s claim that there s no discord on the libertarian ticket wasn t very convincing he also suggested to the globe that he may abandon the libertarian party in the future i m certainly not going to drop them this year he said weld a former two term republican governor of massachusetts said that after blocking a trump presidency he d like to work with republicans like mitt romney and haley barbour to rebuild the gop maybe somebody is going to come up with a new playbook and i don t know who it s going to be but it would be fun to participate he said maybe mike pence both vice presidential candidates seem pretty eager to move past the humiliations of the 2016 campaign update in an interview with reason on wednesday weld tried to clarify or walk back his remarks to the globe he also posted a statement to facebook he s a well known lover of the truth for loeffler a lot of damage has already been done the justice department notified three senators on tuesday that it will not pursue insider trading charges against them after an investigation into stock transactions from the early days of the coronavirus pandemic did not find sufficient evidence they had broken the law according to a person briefed on the investigations the department contacted lawyers for senators kelly loeffler republican of georgia james inhofe republican of oklahoma and dianne feinstein democrat of california all threehad sold substantial amounts of stockin late january or early february when lawmakers were being briefed on the novel coronavirus threat but before the pandemic began roiling financial markets or was fully understood by the public law enforcement officials appear to still be investigating senator richard m burr republican of north carolina whose own mid february stock sales have drawn scrutiny from the justice department and securities and exchange commission last week f b i agentsseized mr burr s cellphone good news out of new york katie miller the highest profile trump administration member to have contracted coronavirus is doing better a real sign of the times georgia s governor bids for the rnc amid talk that charlotte might not host after all there needs to be something for democrats to panic about and right now this is it in early april jason furman a top economist in the obama administration and now a professor at harvard was speaking via zoom to a large bipartisan group of top officials from both parties the economy had just been shut down unemployment was spiking and some policymakers were predicting an era worse than the great depression the economic carnage seemed likely to doom president donald trump s chances at reelection furman tapped to give the opening presentation looked into his screen of poorly lit boxes of frightened wonks and made a startling claim we are about to see the best economic data we ve seen in the history of this country he said the former cabinet secretaries and federal reserve chairs in the zoom boxes were confused though some of the republicans may have been newly relieved and some of the democrats suddenly concerned everyone looked puzzled and thought i had misspoken furman said in an interview instead of forecasting a prolonged depression level economic catastrophe furman laid out a detailed case for why the months preceding the november election could offer trump the chance to brag truthfully about the most explosive monthly employment numbers and gdp growth ever risk public health or else president donald trump on monday morning threatened to move august s republican national convention out of north carolina unless there are guarantees the state will let everyone attend i love the great state of north carolina so much so that i insisted on having the republican national convention in charlotte at the end of august unfortunately democrat governor roycoopernc is still in shutdown mood unable to guarantee that by august we will be allowed full attendance in the arena he began in a string of four tweets the rncis scheduled to be held in charlotte on aug 24 27 less than a week after democrats are set to wrap up their rescheduled convention in milwaukee it s not clear where the republican convention might be moved or how easily that could be done on relatively short notice and this is only part of why the way too late european travel ban was a complete disaster the europe restrictions followed six weeks later but unleashed chaos in ways that surpassed even that of the muslim ban current and former officials said key agencies including the departments of homeland security and transportation had no meaningful input in the nature of the europe restrictions or how and when they would be executed an administration official said officials from both agencies were present at meetings where the ban was discussed the administration scrambled to round up contractors to conduct temperature checks on tens of thousands of passengers officials said the magnitude of the mobilization was unprecedented even so the contractors were overrun by the rush of travelers that trump had helped unleash even the most basic screening steps seemed to backfire the cdc failed to distribute a new paper questionnaire in time for it to be shared with airlines in advance meaning passengers had to fill it out upon arrival as a result travelers found themselves reaching around one another for slips of paper and pencils risking transmission as the bottlenecks got worse already a subscriber log in or link your magazine subscription
