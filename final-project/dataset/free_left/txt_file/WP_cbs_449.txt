the chairman and ceo of jpmorgan chase tells lesley stahl he s optimistic about the economy and explains why he s not running for president the story of jamie dimon is the story of modern wall street he sits atop the country s largest bank as ceo and chairman of jpmorgan chase he oversees more than 2 trillion in assets and a quarter million employees from manhattan to mumbai he was there when banking went from button down and by the book to flashy and too big to fail through the 2008 financial crisis and into today s era of even bigger banks and now presidents prime ministers princes and sheiks seek his counsel so who better to ask about president trump s tariffs and trade war the income gap and the recent criticisms of him by democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren lesley stahl so elizabeth warren said in iowa the other day our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and powerful and you jumped in and said this week about her that she was vilifying successful people and having harsh words for wall street bankers jamie dimon what i was commenting on is that anything that vilifies people i just don t like i think you know most people are good not all of em i think you should vilify nazis but you shouldn t vilify people who worked hard to accomplish things and so my comment is i think it s american society we re just attacking each other all the time lesley stahl she said that the system is working great for the wealthy and well connected and jamie dimon she brings you up doesn t want that to change jamie dimon i m not gonna comment on anyone in particular lesley stahl but she s commenting on you you ve become a target whether you wanna respond to it or not you re her target and you re alexandria ocasio cortez s target jamie dimon i understand that a person in this seat is gonna be a target in this day and age of certain politicians and stuff like that but the notion that i m not a patriot or that some of these other folks aren t pat that s just dead wrong so you know my view is let s all working together and i don t mind if i a few barbs are thrown my way by anybody lesley stahl you re tough jamie dimon i m not that tough but i there s nothing i can do about it lesley stahl the stock market is going through the roof and yet manufacturing production is down over the past year wage growth is slowing so when you look at the state of the economy right now what do you see do you see strength do you see petering out jamie dimon the consumer which is 70 of the u s economy is quite strong confidence is very high their balance sheets are in great shape and you see that the strength of the american consumer is driving the american economy and the global economy and while business slowed down my current view is that no it just was a slowdown not a petering out lesley stahl you sound pretty optimistic about the economy jamie dimon yeah well i am lesley stahl well what about the issue of unpredictability right now on the economy is that worrisome to you it must be worrisome to every businessman in the country jamie dimon the world is unpredictable i think it s a mistake lesley stahl well more unpredictable than usual jamie dimon no if you look at history if you take a newspaper and open it at any month of any year you d have the same list of hugely unpredictable things lesley stahl why doesn t it feel that way why does it feel as if we were in a particularly uncertain time jamie dimon human nature looks at fear and reacts to the short run but again there ve been like 50 or 60 international crises since world war ii only one really affected the global economy in the short run lesley stahl what was that vietnam jamie dimon no vietnam did not vietnam obviously totally changed america but it was the oil crisis in the middle east in 1973 when oil went from 2 to 20 and we had a global recession there ve been wars with india and pakistan we got iraq afghanistan korea vietnam china had wars with vietnam china had wars with russia none of those things affected the global economy and the other thing is people look at the negatives there are positives the berlin wall went up the berlin wall came down so lesley stahl and the economy wasn t affected is that what you re saying jamie dimon barely this is the most prosperous economy the world has ever seen and it s going to be a very prosperous economy for the next 100 years dimon s even unfazed by the trade war and president trump s imposition of tariffs on china jamie dimon i ve been in china and the chinese will say he brought us to the table lesley stahl you know the tariffs it s like a bomb that you detonate and the problem is it falls on you the bomb falls on them but the bomb falls on you jamie dimon the risk of tariffs was that that it sends up being more a trade war as opposed to a quietly negotiated thing it has to be resolved this is not going to war okay this is trade and economics and resolution would be a good thing and so i hope that takes place china is the far eastern frontier of dimon s global financial empire that he oversees from his office at jpmorgan chase s headquarters in new york city this is the heart of the bank s empire little trading is done on the floor of the new york stock exchange these days traders mostly buy and sell over computers on their own trading floors this is one of several at jpmorgan chase jamie dimon this is one of six trading floors in the building there s like 450 people in this trading floor an equivalent to this in london half of this in hong kong and in 23 other countries around the world jpmorgan chase moves more money in a day than most countries earn in a year jamie dimon we move 6 trillion of money every day lesley stahl every day jamie dimon every day we deal with like 10 000 clients which include governments central banks mutual funds and wealthy individuals including about half the world s known billionaires an exclusive club that jamie dimon himself belongs to he was born in queens new york the grandson of a greek immigrant who did well enough to become a stock broker dimon s dad became one too so it was in the family after harvard business school he went straight to wall street where he climbed quickly and helped usher in the age of the mega banks earning a reputation as a ruthless cost cutter he became ceo of jpmorgan chase in 2006 when profits were soaring on wall street and the financial crisis was brewing in the early days of the crisis in 2008 dimon got a phone call from the head of one of the largest investment banks on wall street at the time bear stearns which was teetering on the verge of collapse jamie dimon the ceo of bear stearns called me up and said can you lend me 29 billion before the night s out because if i don t get it i m gonna go bankrupt and i said i said even even i can t get laugh 29 billion but then the treasury secretary hank paulson leaned on him to buy bear stearns jamie dimon and hank paulson said you gotta buy it you gotta buy it you gotta buy it and i said if i can responsibly do it i said can t jeopardize my own company we ll do it three days later he did it he bought bear stearns for 1 2 billion jamie dimon we thought we saved the system you know we thought that that would ve been the domino that would ve caused the whole system to go down and it was because jpmorgan was strong that we could do it lesley stahl did they jamie dimon as i pointed out in congress it wasn t like buying a house that was buying a house on fire but it was banks and other financial institutions that started the fire by bundling trillions of dollars worth of risky mortgages and selling them knowing in many cases that they were toxic to investors around the world this eventually led to the financial crisis that nearly brought down the global economy lesley stahl looking back do you think that there were some bankers who were outright immoral and unethical they knew exactly what they were doing jamie dimon i believe there are people i m not gonna use the names who were greedy selfish did the wrong stuff overpaid themselves and couldn t give a damn yes lesley stahl greedy reckless were you jamie dimon no lesley stahl do you take any responsibility for the financial crisis jamie dimon no lesley stahl in 2008 but your bank sold those same kind of mortgages jamie dimon we we we yeah okay i lesley stahl toxic mortgages jamie dimon i do take some we participated so did mortgage brokers fannie mae freddie mac the government government policy but yes we did and it was a huge error and it was hugely damaging lesley stahl the banks were bailed out and the little guy whose mortgages crashed lost his or her home many families were destitute and that unfairness has just really hurt the sense that this country s working correctly jamie dimon i totally agree that you know if you re the average american you would be angry at what happened there was no old testament justice too many people a lot of people lost their reputation and money but too many people didn t and you know the small guy got hurt so i completely agree with that lesley stahl i mean the idea that the banks were bailed out and they caused the problem to begin with i mean the sense of unfairness doesn t begin to explain the fury jamie dimon i would feel the same way lesley stahl you re agreeing with that jamie dimon i m agreeing with that i think we let the american people down but also at the same time because we were strong we brought bear stearns we saved 15 or 20 000 jobs and so there s two sides to that story too a little bit and only one has been told well lesley stahl let s talk about the wage gap in this country between the rich and almost everybody else how much of a problem do you see that jamie dimon i think it s a huge problem and i think the wealthy have been getting wealthier too much in many ways so middle class incomes have been kinda flat for maybe 15 years or so and that s not particularly good in america but in particular at the low end 40 of americans make 15 an hour or less they ve particularly been left behind lesley stahl you re talking about people who earn very little money listen to this statistic compensation for executives ceos grew 940 940 in the last 40 years your average worker so middle class middle class grew 12 jamie dimon we haven t done a good job growing our economy and that would fix a lot of that problem lesley stahl executive pay last year you were paid 31 million too high jamie dimon the board sets mine i have nothing to do with it lesley stahl well you could return some of it jamie dimon i could is that gonna solve any of those problems lesley stahl i don t know jamie dimon is it going to solve any of those problems lesley stahl no but you could set an example and say i m not going to take all that money i don t need it jamie dimon i could i m going to leave it to the board to set my comp not you not the press lesley stahl you ve answered every one of my questions but this one you re fobbing off jamie dimon yeah the board has to do it lesley stahl well let me ask it in a general way should executive pay in this country be curbed jamie dimon what does that mean lesley stahl cut back should there be a way to say we re not gonna have such a spread between our workers and the guy at the top jamie dimon you know when you say somethin like that you gotta say how are we gonna do it what does it make sense i think you use the tax system to do that i would not have cut the tax on the rich i would ve extended the earned income tax credit instead which is like a negative income tax credit for lower paid people we probably should change the minimum wage which i don t think has been changed for like 10 or 15 years there are solutions to these problems the problems are real it does not mean free enterprise is bad free enterprise has been very good for jamie dimon and the bank last year jpmorgan chase earned 32 billion in profits one of the things he does as ceo is hold regular town hall meetings with employees like one in delaware to build a sense of team spirit it struck us though as less like a bankers convention than a political rally which led us to ask lesley stahl did you ever think of running for president jamie dimon i thought about thinking about it lesley stahl you thought about thinking about it jamie dimon i talked to one person and i decided to think no more lesley stahl i m asking you because we came upon a quote of yours you said i think i could beat trump i m as tough as he is dimon in abc news video i m as tough as he is i m smarter than he is and by the way this wealthy new yorker actually earned his money it wasn t a gift from daddy president trump responded in a tweet about jamie dimon he doesn t have the aptitude or smarts is a poor public speaker nervous mess the problem with banker jamie dimon running for president is that he doesn t have the aptitude or smarts is a poor public speaker nervous mess otherwise he is wonderful i ve made a lot of bankers and others look much smarter than they are with my great economic policy jamie dimon and i ve seen him after that and y and i walked in the oval office and he said so you would love to have this office wouldn t you laugh and i said laughter not really laughter in his office dimon s known as the great survivor in a career that spans nearly 40 years he s managed to navigate his way through just about every panic boom and bust lesley stahl you re the only ceo who was running the big bank back during the financial crisis who s still there you re the survivor last man standing jamie dimon it s a dangerous place to be lesley stahl talking about survivor you did have cancer tell us about that how did you discover it it must ve been terrifying jamie dimon yeah actually i was shaving i felt a little lump here and i went to see my doctor and he felt it and said you have throat cancer and when some when someone says to you you have cancer it is i mean it s almost un unimaginable like a punch in the face and a fear and of course but the hardest part honestly was telling my family i just didn t know how to do it i said i am gonna tell you somethin but i m gonna be okay and they and the second i said it it was mayhem you know and the thought that i couldn t tell my parents so i had my wife call i just couldn t tell em that their son may die before them lesley stahl oh my god jamie dimon and so you you re going through all this stuff and so lesley stahl and you re clean jamie dimon i m i m on my fifth year so that s lesley stahl that s it that s what they say jamie dimon so far so far so good lesley stahl did you ever say i should resign jamie dimon no i love what i do produced by richard
