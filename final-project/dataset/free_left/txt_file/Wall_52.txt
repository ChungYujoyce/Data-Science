advertisement supported by critic s notebook the proceedings billed as dr anthony fauci s high noon became a surreal pageant of dystopian government and politicized face wear by james poniewozik the proceedings were carried on cable news but the aesthetic was low budget westworld the senate health committee s questioning of four administration health officials tuesday morning on the government s response to the covid 19 pandemic was the highest profile congressional testimony in weeks as many states move toward reopening even as the death tolls rise the subject was if when and how things might safely get back to normal ish but everything in the senate s surreal and desolate visual presentation only underlined that we are light years away from normal typically a high profile senate appearance is the theater of congestion the testifiers appear flanked by advisers and face a forest of cameras and microphones as they stare down a crowded bank of legislators tuesday s proceedings looked instead like a tribunal in some depopulated cyber western dystopia a remote operated camera robo swiveled on the open chamber floor as a couple of human photographers darted about the image of senator lamar alexander republican of tennessee the committee chair self quarantining after an aide tested positive for the coronavirus hovered on a screen above an empty chair the guests all appeared virtually three of them also in some form of precautionary isolation and the handful of senators attending in person kept a cautious distance with tim kaine democrat of virginia shrouded in a bandanna as if he d just come back from robbing a stagecoach this did not look like the america that president trump painted monday when he declared that the country had prevailed against its recent challenge it was a ghost town with everything but the tumbleweeds the guests included dr robert r redfield the director of the centers for disease control and prevention adm brett p giroir the assistant secretary for health and dr stephen m hahn the commissioner of the food and drug administration but top billing belonged to dr anthony s fauci the nation s top infectious disease expert and the administration s point person on pandemic response whose boss in the white house prefers wishful triumphalism tweets and ramblings to following doctor s orders an advance report said that dr fauci planned to warn of needless suffering and death if states rushed to reopen before meeting guideposts of progress suggesting that out of mr trump s eye line he might offer harsher medicine instead he slipped the scalpel in gently the ranking committee democrat patty murray of washington ended up pre empting his suffering and death line in her opening questions he warned that the consequences could be really serious if states moved too fast and countering a trumpist insinuation that the covid 19 death count now over 80 000 has been inflated agreed that the actual toll is likely higher than the official figures but he also offered a spoonful of optimism venturing that it was more likely than not that a vaccine would be available in a year or two while maintaining his genial family practitioner from brooklyn tone away from the presidential briefings that played like the apprentice he likened the process of approving potential treatments to shark tank the references change but the reality tv ness of this administration never goes away the sharpest conflict came when senator rand paul republican of kentucky assailed doom and gloom predictions about the virus and told dr fauci i don t think you re the end all with regard to reopening policy replied the immunologist to the ophthalmologist i give advice according to the best scientific evidence it s possible that the logistics lent themselves less to theatrics and confrontation amid the usual lags and audio glitches mr redfield s connection was especially shaky it s hard to have a good fight over videoconference instead the background details of the telecommuting legislators competed with the public health questions and speechifying senator mike enzi republican of wyoming spoke from an office outfitted with a set of desk antlers while senator bernie sanders independent of vermont was backed by a red hot chili peppers poster the most pointed political battle of the morning was less about what came out of the mouths of senators than what covered them or didn t the democrats in the committee room mostly wore masks the republicans largely didn t or removed them before the proceedings started face masks worn mainly to keep the wearer from inadvertently infecting others have become a metonym for the now partisan argument over how worrisome the pandemic is how much people should change their routines because of it and the extent to which people are morally and socially obligated to inconvenience themselves for the good of others what should be a matter of objective public health practice has become one more polarizing cultural signal splashed across your kisser fittingly senator susan collins of maine one of the more moderate republicans and facing a tough re election campaign began the hearing with no mask then put one on as if trying to keep one lung in each camp dr fauci was alone and maskless on video but late in the hearing he spoke approvingly of how outdoors in washington d c you can see many people out there with masks on which gives me some degree of comfort that people are taking this very seriously if it was a comment on what we witnessed in the hearing room he kept it oblique that s the beauty of videoconferencing no one knows exactly what you re seeing on your own screen advertisement
