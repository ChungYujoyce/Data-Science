donald trump won in all five republican presidential primaries held on tuesday a clean sweep that illustrated his dominance along the eastern seaboard and prompted the real estate mogul to declare himself the presumptive nominee in the democratic race former secretary of state hillary clinton won four of the five states in play on tuesday connecticut delaware maryland and pennsylvania sen bernie sanders vt won the primary in rhode island winners and losers from the i 95 primaries in both parties those results extended the front runner s advantage in convention delegates clinton appeared to have added 170 delegates to her lead over sanders by the associated press s count clinton now has 88percent of the delegates she needs to clinch the democratic nomination in the gop trump exceeded the already high expectations for tuesday as of 10 55 p m the ap projected that trump won at least 105 delegates compared with just five for ohio gov john kasich and one for sen ted cruz tex but the importance of tuesday s wins went beyond those numbers for both clinton and trump they showed that a long drawn out primary fight might be close to an end and that stubborn adversaries seemed to be running out of time clinton speaking to supporters in philadelphia was not very subtly looking beyond the primary attacking trump and making a pitch to democrats to unite behind her whether you support sen sanders or you support me there s much more that unites us than divides us clinton said she later talked about creating an america where love trumps hate the crowd cheered at the pun and a bumper sticker with the slogan was already on sale for 5 at clinton s website april 26 primary results in the republican race trump appeared to be trouncing his rivals by huge margins winning by 30 percentage points or more in the first returns wins on that scale will make it harder for cruz and kasich to argue that trump is a weak and divisive front runner neither of trump s rivals can possibly clinch the nomination before the gop convention in cleveland this summer both men are now relying on long shot strategies which imagine that trump can also be stopped from reaching a majority of republican delegates and that the party s convention will bypass the leader and choose one them instead this is a lot bigger win than we would have expected all five and not only is it all five trump said at a news conference at trump tower in new york he noted that he had passed 60 percent in results from several states when you crack 60 with three people that s very hard to do that s called a massive landslide i consider myself the presumptive nominee absolutely if you look honestly sen cruz and gov kasich should really get out of the race they have no path to victory at all we should heal the republican party bring the republican party together and i m a unifier trump said he will be going to indiana on wednesday where the may 3 primary is shaping up as the last best chance for trump s rivals to stop him to help derail trump kasich agreed this week to not campaign in indiana allowing cruz to focus on the front runner indiana looms large for cruz s slender hopes trump had spent several weeks complaining that the gop s delegate system was rigged against him on tuesday however trump was more ebullient the best way to beat the system is to have evenings like this trump said he likened himself to a boxer winning by knockout when the boxer knocks out the other boxer you don t have to wait around for a decision trump also tried to pivot toward a general election although his attack on clinton seemed more improvised that clinton s bumper sticker ready attack on him if hillary clinton were a man i don t think she would get 5 percent of the vote he said even before the polls closed tuesday night cruz was conceding the expected losses however he showed no indication of withdrawing from the race tonight donald trump is expected to have a good night he said speaking to supporters in knightstown ind in the gym where the movie hoosiers was filmed cruz undercut his hoops credibility however by incorrectly forgetting the name of the hoop he referred to it as a basketball ring but then cruz said that the race would turn his way in states such as indiana tonight this campaign moves back to more favorable terrain kasich was running second in several of tuesday s primaries but it was a distant second hardly an affirmation of the theory that the governor would compete well with trump among the more moderate republicans of the east it seemed likely that even after tuesday s results were tallied kasich would still not have as many delegates as sen marco rubio fla rubio dropped out of the presidential race more than a month ago in campaign parlance kasich was down on tuesday night he was back in ohio and did not make a public statement or speech for clinton tuesday s victories in large urban states reinforced her case against sanders that he has not broadened his coalition much beyond white liberals and that he struggles to win urban areas and populous states sanders however showed no signs of giving up the senator from vermont appeared shortly after 8 p m to boisterous cheers in an arena in huntington w va choosing to hold an election night rally in a state that holds its primary in two weeks this campaign is not just about electing a president it is about transforming our nation sanders said at the outset of his remarks to a crowd of about 6 400 it is about having the courage to demand a political revolution and you are the
