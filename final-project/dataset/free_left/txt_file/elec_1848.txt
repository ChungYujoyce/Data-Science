while others try to brag their way to the oval office one republican has quietly thoughtfully paying attention to what matters beaufort s c on boundary street leading into the city sgt white s diner is just past the lights at the intersection of ribault road across from municipal court and alongside a vacant bail bonds office hours before the polls opened and people voted in the republican primary here there was a steady stream of customers for the pit cooked barbecue chicken and barbecued ribs and it seemed more interest in what might happen over the long haul leading to november than who would win saturday my husband s disabled a woman who gave her name as ella mae jenkins said as she waited for her takeout order of ribs and my boy is overseas now again for the fourth time where she was asked can t say she replied he s air force special ops and they do secret stuff so i ain t sayin the woman behind the counter put ms jenkins s order in a bag and ella mae walked to her car parked in a lot alongside a piggly wiggly market that s been out of business for some time she spoke briefly about her husband s disability due to being badly wounded nearly 50 years ago at a place called quang tri city in a country then called south vietnam he s had a hard life but the good lord let him live she said we re thankful for that she said she had little interest in politics and paid hardly any attention to what the candidates were saying and that she would be happy when the campaign went to another state then i can watch my shows without seein all these fools on my tv fools yes sir fools she said uttering the word with an explanation point in the air damn fools they all talkin about killin these terrorists like it s some kinda game ain t no game people die in the sky above two f 18 hornets cut through a low ribbon of haze heading to marine corps air station beaufort just up the road from sgt white s diner the noise and power of their engines filled the air but ms jenkins never looked up because their appearance is part of daily life here where the reality of america s military its cost and duties as well as its existence are the framework for so many proud families who are charged with paying the price for loose political rhetoric a few miles east past the causeway above the harbor river and down malecon drive is the main gate at marine corps recruit depot east at parris island here the pine trees line much of the approach some stretching 50 feet and higher and then on the island there are fewer of them and the wind warm now in mid february meets no obstacles as it whips through the day fluttering flags on the buildings that house the young who someday will be asked to fight for the dreams of the old who send them to war here in south carolina memory is part of the cement of a culture rooted in service to the country and here on parris island with roads named for bloodshed and lives lost in places like chosin guadalcanal bataan and quang tri the cheap chatter of candidates talking tough is merely muffled noise when measured against the drills and preparation of those who could be sent to places where polls and political ambition are meaningless here the dreams and desires of those on the ballot live in a universe totally estranged from the future of the men and women who might one day face a bullet listening to some of the republican candidates for president is like eavesdropping on men trying to earn their letter sweater with worthless phrases carpet bombing crushing isis as if words alone will accomplish the mission and the lives of those sent into the fight are merely an anonymous squadron of props used to advance a political agenda the world is on fire a dangerous place and too many seeking to lead appear to be clueless or ignorant of what is required to keep the country secure charleston south carolina is about a 90 minute drive northwest of beaufort and parris island it is an old city reborn with new charm and an influx of snowbirds from the north attracted by its ease comfort and accessibility in the harbor fort sumter is a constant reminder of the first shots fired in the civil war and the distant echoes and impact of that war can sometimes still be felt in the air all these years later the uss yorktown is also here at patriots point naval museum here it was commissioned in 1943 named after the yorktown sunk by japanese at the battle of midway in june 1942 today it is a museum and friday night hours before south carolina voted john kasich the governor of ohio came to talk to about 300 people who had gathered below deck kasich is an interesting candidate he knew his chances in a state dominated by evangelicals and anger were not great but he arrived with a smile on his face and a sound of contentment in his voice because it was not in him to feed the beast of those filled with rage and despairing of the future he stood on a stage with a huge american flag hanging behind him he told the people he d been at a town hall rally earlier in the day and could sense the worry that many have about the direction of the country and the frustration and failure of politics in washington i looked out in the crowd looked at the faces in that room and i saw my family right there in the third row saw my family sitting there listening to me oh they weren t my family but i knew them i know what worries them and i know what worries you but we live in the greatest country god ever created and we re going to be even greater if we stop listening to all this doom and gloom we re getting i m here to tell you we can do this but we have to do it together together all of us together after he spoke he was walking through the bowels of the boat on his way to another stop on the long trail and he was talking about those who served the country and those who will serve he spoke about the families in ohio who have lost a child a husband a brother in iraq and afghanistan i meet with them one on one kasich was saying and i cry with them i m not embarrassed to tell you i cry i just wish we d pay more attention to what war costs and i wish more of us would talk about what it means to be commander in chief that phrase is more than words it s the ultimate responsibility of a president we re cheating people by not talking enough about that role shame on us and shame on this process we have of electing a president the way we re doing it now we re better than this and people deserve more than what they re getting from us from all of us then he climbed on board a bus off to another stop in a campaign that is already draining for the candidates and the people anxious worried frustrated and more than a bit fearful of the immediate future
