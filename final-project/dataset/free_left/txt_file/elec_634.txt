policy and public opinion in the states this process of direct democracy has often proved more effective than the customary actions of a party politician interest group or deep pocketed donor at addressing some of the most divisive topics in our history including suffrage prohibition gay rights the death penalty and marijuana despite their significant and lasting impact ballot measures and the varied laws governing how they work can be daunting and complex which states allow the ballot initiative process not all do why are initiatives so popular in california yet unavailable in new york how do voters get measures placed on the ballot none of this is simple or straightforward in fact many people now find the language used in these measures so confusing that they abstain from voting on them entirely the origins of direct democracy in the united states date from the 1600s when new england colonists debated and voted on ordinances and other issues during town hall meetings this set the stage for legislative referrals which as their name implies are measures referred to the ballot by a state legislature in 1778 citizens in massachusetts were the first to attempt ratification of their state constitution by a legislative referendum several other states followed suit in subsequent decades and in 1857 congress mandated that all changes to state constitutions for states entering the union after that year had to be approved by voters today voters in 49 states excluding delaware must vote on and approve legislatively referred constitutional amendments these have become the most prominent type of measure seen on ballots in recent years and they enable legislators to keep a finger on the pulse of the electorate not all states though allow voters to weigh in on changes to state statutes and laws legislators in 23 states can refer changes to a state s statutes to the ballot as with constitutional amendments voters can approve or reject only the laws that their legislature decides to place before them while a majority of ballot measures work like this in other words are legislatively referred two other types of measures initiatives and referendums tend to attract more media attention money and controversy the unique nature of these measures stems from their origins the citizenry ballot initiatives are devised by voters who then circulate a petition for signatures from other registered voters if the initiative garners enough valid signatures and uses language that conforms with the state s laws it is put before the electorate for approval citizens can use this tool to bring about votes on a proposed state statute or a constitutional amendment depending on the laws in a given state citizens too can gain a veto referendum or simply a referendum by collecting enough signatures to place a law that has been passed by the state legislature on the ballot voters then decide whether to keep or nullify the law the topics addressed by initiatives and referendums have ranged from the mundane to the exotic from bond measures to the act of dueling the practice of statewide initiative and referendum gained traction among the populist movements of the progressive era around the turn of the 20th century frustrated with the ineptitude of government and elected officials these movements demanded a comprehensive program of reform that included women s suffrage the direct election of united states senators the recall mechanism primary elections and the initiative and referendum process the most essential of these measures the reform movement came to realize was the initiative process without it the rest of the program risked being blocked by state legislatures and ultimately failing activists lobbied state legislators to add amendments allowing for an initiative and popular referendum process in the states at first it was an uphill battle and lawmakers by and large wanted to preserve their prerogative elected officials should govern they felt not the people by plebiscite but the perseverance of initiative and referendum supporters paid off in 1898 south dakota became the first state to adopt the process for statewide ballots although nebraska allowed local ballot measures the year before utah and oregon implemented it in 1900 and 1902 respectively and many others soon followed all told 26 states as well as the district of columbia currently have some form of initiative or referendum allowing citizens to directly engage in policy making the process gained currency mainly in western states which to this day have a more robust culture of direct democracy more than 60 percent of all initiative activity has taken place in just six states arizona california colorado north dakota oregon and washington eastern and southern states initially rejected initiatives and referendums largely out of fear that direct democracy would empower immigrants and african americans that anxiety eventually dissipated mississippi became the most recent state to implement the initiative and referendum process with voters approving the change in 1992 since then voters there have weighed in on pressing issues like term limits abortion and education some consider the initiative and referendum process valuable for voters in the states that allow it viewing it as a vital tool to keep government in check according to the initiative and referendum institute states that feature an initiative on the ballot in a given election year also feature higher turnouts of between 3 percent and 4 5 percent in presidential years and between 7 percent and 9 percent in midterm years over states without an initiative on the ballot others view the initiative and referendum process through a more cynical lens over the years ballot measures especially initiatives have been hijacked by pressure groups to push particular political agendas for example party operatives have used ballot measures that are designed to increase voter turnout for their slate of candidates a prime example occurred during the 2004 presidential election republicans in ohio a key swing state ensured that the ballot would carry a vote on amendment 1 a state mandate to recognize only heterosexual marriages amendment 1 not only passed by a handy margin but it also helped drive up republican turnout generally in ohio george w bush won the state over john kerry a similar situation may unfold in california in the election this fall the state supreme court ruled in favor of placing on the statewide ballot a nonbinding advisory question asking voters to weigh in on whether congress should take steps to overturn the controversial citizens united supreme court case critics contend that the measure which particularly appeals to progressives is on the ballot solely to spur democratic voter turnout in addition to the problem of politicos gaming the system critics of initiatives and referendums have also questioned whether voters are informed enough to make decisions on complicated policy issues that concern is amplified by the massive amounts of money sometimes thrown at campaigns either supporting or opposing a given measure some have concluded that even direct democracy has been corrupted and turned into a pay to play gambit despite these critiques every even numbered election year hundreds of measures are put before voters with a handful on off election year ballots as well since 1900 nearly 14 000 measures including those referred by state legislatures and citizens have been decided by voters of these about 61 percent were approved and 39 percent were defeated love them or hate them ballot measures aren t disappearing in the near future in fact with signature requirements in many states lower than in the past thanks to poor voter turnout in 2014 this may be a blockbuster year for initiatives for instance for the first time in recent history more initiatives are certified for the ballot than legislatively referred amendments this much is certain whatever the negatives of the parties presidential nominees the predominance of hot button issues like marijuana guns health care and campaign finance on ballots means voter turnout will be as high as the stakes advertisement
