watch cbsn live by bo erickson musadiq bidar nicole sganga april 22 2020 4 30 pm cbs news while many businesses and organizations throughout the country are being forced to downsize amid the covid 19 pandemic joe biden is facing unusual challenges in expanding his presidential campaign now that he is thepresumptive democratic nominee the former vice president does have some advantages in particular the early united front shown by the party including recent endorsements by progressive former rivals bernie sanders and elizabeth warren endorsements like these are often followed by the hiring of some of the vanquished candidates seasoned campaign staff but as the public health crisis continues to keep the economy and routine life largely at a standstill job seeking democrats may also have to wait a little longer to join the presidential campaign from the end of march until recently multiple democratic operatives described what they called a campaign hiring freeze to cbs news seven democratic operatives who inquired about employment opportunities with the biden campaign for a range of positions told cbs news the guidance they received was that hiring was still on hold all of the operatives had worked for democratic primary campaigns and were granted anonymity to avoid any potential employment impact when the primary process ends even unofficially it s not unusual for the winning campaign to reach out to senior staff of former rivals to mine for hires ahead of the general election but several senior staffers on former democratic campaigns said they were not yet aware of wide scale plans to bring on their former staffers some of the operatives say they understand that the pandemic may complicate general election hiring at least 478 people were on biden s payroll by march according to federal election commission fec records this figure does not include several of biden s most senior aides who appear to be paid directly for consulting or through their eponymous firms nor does it include the recent hires of a few high level staffers including a new campaign manager jen o malley dillon and a lgbtq vote director who will help mobilize the community by the end of march biden was the clear delegate leader outpacing sanders and bringing in 46 7 million in fundraising according to fec records a huge haul that could help grow the campaign staff we are building onto all aspects of the campaign especially digital and have begun to hire additional people a biden campaign spokesperson told cbs news when asked about the campaign s hiring plans but scaling up a general election campaign after a primary battle is more than just adding staff to the ranks as the leader of the party in that moment in time it provides you the opportunity to heal the party that means making sure you reach out and hire the best and brightest people in rival campaigns mitt romney s 2012 presidential campaign manager matt rhoades told cbs news the republican campaign veteran recounted transitioning from a lean and mean staff of 87 during the primaries to more than 500 during the general election ultimately overseeing a budget north of 900 million other former campaign managers who oversaw their campaign s general election hiring say biden faces an unusual challenge hillary clinton s 2016 campaign manager robby mook told cbs news her campaign started hiring in june when clinton became the presumptive nominee by the end of the summer mook said there were around 4 500 staffers nationwide in 2020 the pandemic has kind of thrown a wrench into normal planning mook added biden has had almost a month to begin general election planning at this point that is just a huge advantage and he is certainly going to need all of that to get caught up with trump mook said rhoades romney s campaign manager pointed out that social distancing will have a big impact biden will have to figure out how to shift campaign resources from regular door knocking and into the digital space the pandemic also could transform voter priorities and some wonder whether biden s campaign will have the time to accurately gauge the national mood it s not going to do any good right now to go door to door and start identifying voters john mccain s 2008 campaign manager rick davis who led the republican campaign through the 2008 global financial crisis told cbs news nobody wants to get a call at seven o clock at night in their home saying are you for joe biden or donald trump as biden s focus has been primarily on the covid 19 response and recovery davis argued biden s wait and see strategy could pay off long term biden has the benefit of a president distracted by a global pandemic davis said so if i were giving him advice i would tell him don t spend a penny one dollar in october is going to be worth more than one dollar today saving campaign cash by holding off on hiring could help bridge the divide between biden s bank and mr trump s campaign coffers the power of incumbency is strong rhoades told cbs news reflecting on his campaign s uphill climb against president obama s 2012 political machine and that s something you re always going to have to go up against from a resource standpoint i ve had the opportunity to work for an incumbent president in a presidential campaign and i ve had the opportunity to compete against the incumbent president in a presidential campaign i can just say man it s a lot easier and it s a lot better living when you re an incumbent presidential campaign for sure for the trump campaign that better living is the two year build up of a joint apparatus merging state party infrastructure with the incumbent president s re election team to date the campaign and republican national committee joint field and data operation called trump victory by party officials boasts nearly 800 people in 23 states including battlegrounds like michigan minnesota pennsylvania ohio and wisconsin and the republican party s 2016 operation remained partially intact following mr trump s inauguration with 5 000 volunteer fellows in place nationwide according to a senior party official like the republicans the democratic national committee has been building up a nationwide organization to assist the eventual nominee especially in competitive states but the dnc and the biden campaign have not yet signed a joint fundraising agreement to coordinate fundraising together the trump campaign and rnc have more than just the power of the incumbency staffing too with reported fundraising of 63 million in march they also possess the power of the pocketbook with 240 million in the bank the two groups have raised a record breaking 667 million this re election cycle despite down ballot challenges adjusted for inflation that is 240 million more than president obama s re election operation at this point in 2012 eleanor watson contributed reporting to this story first published on april 22 2020 4 30 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc
