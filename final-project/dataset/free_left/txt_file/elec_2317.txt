advertisement supported by editorial by the editorial board the battle to be the republican choice for president has been nasty brutish and anything but short the hope among some republicans is that the iowa caucuses on monday and the new hampshire primary on feb 9 will promote a candidate who can appeal to the half of their electorate that doesn t support the two current front runners those two donald trump and ted cruz are equally objectionable for different reasons mr trump has neither experience in nor interest in learning about national security defense or global trade even unemployment figures which he s pegged at 23 or 42 percent the correct number is 5 percent don t merit his attention from deporting mexican immigrants and barring muslims to slapping a 45 percent tariff on chinese imports mr trump invents his positions as he goes along his supporters say they don t care what they may not know is how deliberately he is currying their favor at a meeting with the times s editorial writers mr trump talked about the art of applause lines you know he said of his events if it gets a little boring if i see people starting to sort of maybe thinking about leaving i can sort of tell the audience i just say we will build the wall and they go nuts ted cruz s campaign isn t about constitutional principles it s about ambition in his three years in the senate he has helped to engineer a shutdown of the government and has alienated virtually the entire chamber both of which he bills as accomplishments since he lacks real ones now whether he s threatening to carpet bomb syrian villages or pitching a phony flat tax that would batter middle class consumers mr cruz will say anything to win the greater worry is that he d follow words with action more than a half dozen other candidates are battling for survival jeb bush has failed to ignite much support but at least he has criticized the bigotry of mr trump and the warmongering of mr cruz senator marco rubio currently embracing the alarmist views of the front runners seems to have forgotten his more positive new american century campaign based on helping the middle class the terrorist attacks in paris and san bernardino exposed ben carson s inability to grasp the world gov chris christie of new jersey has said he would shoot down russian planes engage with the dead king of jordan and bar refugees including orphaned syrian toddlers gov john kasich of ohio though a distinct underdog is the only plausible choice for republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race and mr kasich is no moderate as governor he s gone after public sector unions fought to limit abortion rights and opposed same sex marriage still as a veteran of partisan fights and bipartisan deals during nearly two decades in the house he has been capable of compromise and believes in the ability of government to improve lives he favors a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants and he speaks of government s duty to protect the poor the mentally ill and others in the shadows while republicans in congress tried more than 60 times to kill obamacare mr kasich did an end run around ohio s republican legislature to secure a 13 billion medicaid expansion to cover more people in his state i am so tired of my colleagues out here on the stage spending all their time talking about barack obama he told a town hall crowd in new hampshire his term is over mr kasich said recently that he had raised the bar in this election i ve talked about hope and the future and positive things in this race how rare that is advertisement
