advertisement supported by the attorney general has suggested that the justice department review of the russia investigation has uncovered troubling findings without going into details by adam goldman julian e barnes and katie benner washington for years president trump has complained bitterly about f b i officials who investigated his campaign s ties to russia and about the rogue bureaucrats of the deep state at the intelligence agencies portraying them as enemies out to delegitimize his presidency now a special justice department inquiry investigating those officials has taken on another of mr trump s irritants leaks to the news media investigators for john h durham the u s attorney in connecticut leading the investigation have asked witnesses about news articles published in early 2017 that former administration officials blame for prompting the chaos that dominated the early days of the trump presidency according to three people familiar with the inquiry among them was a washington post column about michael t flynn the president s first national security adviser one of the people said what mr durham has found is hidden from public view and the coronavirus pandemic has slowed his progress the people said but attorney general william p barr has promoted the investigation in recent days saying that mr durham has uncovered troubling problems and indicating that some results could made public before the general election in november mr trump has said he looks forward to the outcome of the inquiry and a report or criminal charges before the election would all but assure that he weaponize it for political gain the new details show that mr durham s inquiry is broader than previously known not just examining intelligence on russia and how it was handled or investigative decisions by the f b i but whether sources spoke to the post intending to damage mr trump s presidency the president and his allies in congress have long condemned leaks revealing unflattering information about the administration mr durham declined to comment a spokesman said as did a spokeswoman for the justice department mr durham was initially assigned to examine the origins of the f b i investigation into whether any trump associates conspired with russia s interference in 2016 to tilt the election since then his team has not only questioned f b i officials but also intelligence analysts suggesting that he was taking aim at the spy agencies most explosive conclusion about 2016 that president vladimir v putin of russia intervened to benefit mr trump investigators have also examined the role of john o brennan the c i a director in 2016 in how intelligence agencies assessed russia s election interference though mr trump s allies have accused mr brennan who has made his distaste for the president widely known of tainting intelligence to go after mr trump the senate intelligence committee said this week in a report that it found no evidence that the intelligence community s assessment on russian interference had been politicized last year mr durham also started examining the 2017 column by the post s david ignatius said a person familiar with that line questioning mr ignatius revealed that mr flynn had spoken in late 2016 with sergey i kislyak the russian ambassador to the united states at the time as the obama administration was about to place sanctions on russia for its election sabotage mr ignatius noted mr flynn s close contacts with the russians and suggested that because mr flynn was apparently conducting foreign policy while another administration was in power he might have violated the logan act the law is an obscure statute that bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the united states and foreign governments and is widely considered to be essentially defunct the next month mr flynn resigned after lying to the vice president and other white house officials about the call with mr kislyak he eventually pleaded guilty to lying to the f b i about the nature of his discussions with mr kislyak but later backtracked asking a federal judge to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea mr flynn s lawyer sidney powell has repeatedly accused prosecutors of hiding exculpatory evidence claims that the judge has rejected on friday federal prosecutors turned over documents in the case that she described on twitter as remarkable new long withheld evidence and a person briefed on them said that the documents indicated that f b i agents did not follow standard procedures as they investigated mr flynn prosecutors said the materials were reports related to the flynn investigation along with communications and notes by f b i agents assigned to it ms powell said they should have been shared with her client s legal team at the outset of his prosecution and asked the judge to unseal them mr ignatius s column set off a chain of events that helped lead to the russia probe k t mcfarland the former deputy national security adviser to mr trump wrote in her recent book revolution trump washington and we the people mr durham has reviewed ms mcfarland s interviews with f b i investigators in other inquiries examining what she has said about mr ignatius s reporting and asked other witnesses about it according to person familiar with elements of the investigation she revised her answers to questions from investigators for the special counsel robert s mueller iii on elements of mr flynn s talks with mr kislyak but has accused the investigators of trying to ensnare her in perjury trap mr durham has not questioned ms mcfarland whether mr durham has taken over an existing leak investigation of the ignatius column opened in 2017 or is doing a parallel review as part of his larger inquiry remains unclear since the special counsel s investigation ended prosecutors in the u s attorney s office in the district of columbia have overseen matters related to mr flynn it was not clear whether mr durham was investigating any other leaks while mr durham has said little publicly about the investigation mr barr has been more vocal he has repeatedly made clear that he believes that the f b i should have never opened its trump russia investigation contradicting a finding by the justice department inspector general that law enforcement officials had sufficient reason to begin the inquiry the inspector general michael e horowitz also documented serious errors in the process to seek court approval for a wiretap on a former trump adviser carter page whom investigators suspected of being an agent of russia an f b i lawyer has been accused of altering an email as part of the application process and could face prosecution mr barr has said that mr durham found problems with the investigation that go beyond the applications for the page wiretap a small aspect of the sprawling russia inquiry the evidence shows that we are not dealing with just mistakes or sloppiness mr barr told the fox news host laura ingraham this month there is something far more troubling here and we re going to get to the bottom of it and if people broke the law and we can establish that with the evidence they will be prosecuted the attorney general s comments about the investigation have troubled defense lawyers who believe that mr barr is tainting mr durham s work by talking about the inquiry before it is concluded some of the lawyers privately questioned whether they would let mr durham or his investigators interview their clients without a subpoena because of mr barr s comments the attorney general has brushed aside concerns about publicly revealing the results of a potentially politically explosive investigation close to an election raising the prospect that mr durham s results could be made public before the presidential election justice department policies prohibit law enforcement officials from taking investigative steps or filing criminal charges to affect elections mr barr said that those rules do not apply to the durham inquiry because none of his targets are running for president or are closely associated with the presidential candidates the idea is you don t go after candidates you don t indict candidates or perhaps someone that s officially close to a candidate that is essentially the same within a certain number of days before an election mr barr told the conservative radio host hugh hewitt this week but you know as i say i don t think any of the people whose actions are under review by durham fall into that category mr barr s actions have hamstrung prosecutors before an investigation into the former f b i deputy director andrew g mccabe fell apart in part because of prosecutors concerns that mr barr s handling of the special counsel report would make their case look even more politicized in addition to the president s attacks on an accomplished former top law enforcement official people familiar with that inquiry have said the attorney general decided to pronounce mr trump cleared of obstruction of justice in 2019 after the mueller report put forward evidence that mr trump had committed that crime but stopped short of rendering any prosecutorial judgment mr barr s decision prompted swift condemnation that he was going beyond his role to help mr trump politically and putting the department s typical independence in jeopardy mr durham is relying on a team of prosecutors including nora r dannehy and neeraj patel from connecticut as well as former and current f b i agents to complete his investigation anthony scarpelli a top prosecutor from the u s attorney s office in washington was detailed to the team along with a federal prosecutor from manhattan andrew defilippis two former f b i agents timothy fuhrman and jack eckenrode are also assisting an f b i agent who oversaw public corruption in chicago and served in ukraine as an assistant legal attach peter angelini has also joined mr durham s team
