buttigieg is going for the hope and change voters there was a word missing from the speech pete buttigieg gave in south bend indiana announcing his presidential campaign it s a word you heard twice in bernie sanders s and beto o rourke s announcement speeches nine times in cory booker s 21 times in kirsten gillibrand s 23 times in kamala harris s and 25 times in elizabeth warren s that word fight instead buttigieg returned to a word those speeches shied away from a word whose relative absence from the democratic primary is all the stranger given its potency in past democratic campaigns that word hope which buttigieg said eight times gillibrand said three times o rourke uttered once and sanders harris warren and booker avoided entirely bill clinton famously was the man from hope barack obama ran on hope and change but hope has become unfashionable in the democratic primary partly that s because democrats are trying to build a legacy distinct from obama s and are looking for language of their own partly that s because the lesson many democrats took from sanders s strong showing in 2016 and donald trump s victory is that an angry country is looking for fighters and no matter how many times hillary clinton played fight song at rallies a critical mass of voters didn t think she really meant it more on the gendered dynamics of this in a minute buttigieg s rise has been unexpected and to be honest a bit weird young mayors of midsize cities don t typically vault ahead of talented presidential fields to poll third in iowa and new hampshire before they ve even officially announced their campaigns candidly i don t even know all the reasons why this is going so well buttigieg told new york magazine but there is a reason and it s bound up in the psychology that attracts liberals to the word hope liberals and conservatives have different ideologies different philosophies different policies different parties but beneath all that is the fact that they have different psychologies in their book open versus closed christopher johnston christopher federico and howard lavine write that democrats and republicans are now sharply distinguished by a set of basic psychological dispositions related to experiential openness a general dimension of personality tapping tolerance for threat and uncertainty in one s environment a similar argument using slightly different data can be found in marc hetherington and jonathan weiler s prius or pickup of the many factors that make up your worldview one is more fundamental than any other in determining which side of the divide you gravitate toward your perception of how dangerous the world is fear is perhaps our most primal instinct after all so it s only logical that people s level of fearfulness informs their outlook on life in predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences john alford john hibbing and kevin smith write numerous studies have linked these personality dimensions to differences in the mix of tastes and preferences that seem to reliably separate liberals and conservatives people who score high on openness for example tend to like envelope pushing music and abstract art people who score high on conscientiousness are more likely to be organized faithful and loyal one review of this large research literature finds these sorts of differences consistently cropping up across nearly 70 years of studies on personality research the punch line of course is that this same literature also reports a consistent relationship between these dimensions of personality and political temperament those open to new experiences are not just hanging jackson pollock prints in disorganized bedrooms while listening to techno pop reinterpretations of bach by experimental jazz bands they are also more likely to identify themselves as liberals these differences show up in surveys in experiments and in lifestyle choices people high in openness are more likely to enjoy trying new foods traveling to new places living in diverse cities keeping a messy desk they re less sensitive to threatening photos and disgusting images even when measuring physical indicators like skin connectivity eye tracking and saliva at the core of this worldview divide is hope in its most basic literal form are you hopeful about new things new people new places does change excite you does difference if it does you are more likely to be liberal if you look at the new the different and feel a spike of fear you re more likely to be a conservative not every liberal is high in this kind of openness and not every conservative is low in it but these associations are present and strong across huge numbers of studies spanning dozens of countries in one meta analysis of the literature john jost chadly stern nicholas rule and joanna sterling looked at 134 surveys in 16 countries and found a significant association between subjective perceptions of threat and conservatism over the past 50 years america s political parties have increasingly sorted themselves into ideologically and demographically distinct coalitions and part of that sorting has been psychological as the democratic party has diversified it s become particularly attractive to people who see difference as strength and who are excited by the idea of a changing country the republican party has experienced the same process in reverse obama and trump in their respective campaigns took this subtext of american politics and made it into bumper stickers a black man with a strange name won the presidency tying together the words change and hope he was succeeded by a white man who won the presidency promising to turn back the clock who built a campaign around the word again all this has supercharged america s psychological sorting johnston federico and lavine find that the more politically engaged someone is now the more intensely correlated their psychology and their voting behavior becomes hetherington and weiler who measure a related basket of traits they call fixed and fluid find that now among the fixed 84 percent of those who chose one of these two labels chose conservative while among the fluid 80 percent of those who chose one of them chose liberal most of the democrats running for president have tried in their own ways to out trump trump they promise to be the populist fighter he only pretends to be but a lot of liberals temperamentally and psychologically don t want a fight they don t want politics to be an endless war they believe that mutual understanding is possible that the country will respond to someone willing to believe and call forth the best of it that s not just their view of politics it s their view of life it s the view that obama spoke to in the speech that made him a star even as we speak there are those who are preparing to divide us the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes well i say to them tonight there s not a liberal america and a conservative america there s the united states of america there s not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america there s the united states of america and again in his 2008 campaign announcement speech you came here because you believe in what this country can be in the face of war you believe there can be peace in the face of despair you believe there can be hope in the face of a politics that shut you out that s told you to settle that s divided us for too long you believe that we can be one people reaching for what s possible building that more perfect union and even if mitch mcconnell has disabused many liberals of the notion that this style of politics will pass laws it still describes the candidates and messages they find themselves drawn to obama appealed to them because he represented them because he was one of them and if they could they would put him back in office a third time there are a lot of these democrats but there s not at the moment a lot of competition for them you can see the yearning in joe biden s persistent lead in the polls biden s popularity frustrates lefties who think him insufficiently progressive and liberals who see him as an out of touch white guy but biden knows that a lot of his supporters aren t really supporting him they re supporting obama by supporting him an associated press story on biden s planning suggests channeling this longing will form the foundation of his campaign joe biden is finalizing the framework for a white house campaign that would cast him as an extension of barack obama s presidency and political movement he s betting that the majority of democratic voters are eager to return to the style and substance of that era and that they ll view him as the best option to lead the way back biden s weakness is that temperamentally demographically and stylistically he s not that much like obama he was brought onto obama s ticket to add balance to offer reassurance if you looked at obama and saw too much change too fast you could look at biden and see a familiar face as rebecca traister wrote biden s role has been to comfort the lost prized and most fondly imagined democratic voter the one who s like him that guy in the diner that guy in ohio that guy who s white and so put off by the changed terms of gendered and racial power in this country that decades ago he fled for the party that was working to roll back the social advancements that had robbed him of his easy hold on power this is where buttigieg has found an opening buttigieg can t run as the heir to obama s administration but of the candidates he s the one who uses his personal story and political message to most closely echo obama s appeal buttigieg began his announcement speech by doing exactly what obama did in his early speeches he framed the choice america faces as embracing a moment of change with hope or rejecting it out of fear change is coming ready or not buttigieg said the question of our time is whether families and workers will be defeated by the changes beneath us or whether we will master them as obama did before him buttigieg turned his own life story in which an alienated closeted teen watches his country change enough to not only accept him but embrace him into an argument that america is a place worth being hopeful about if i could go back into the past it wouldn t be out of a desire to live there no if i went into the past it would be just 20 years back to find a teenage boy in the basement and to tell him he ll be all right more than all right to tell him that one rainy april day before he even turns 40 he ll wake up to headlines about whether he s rising too quickly as he becomes a top tier contender for the american presidency and to tell him that on that day he announces his campaign for president he ll do it with his husband looking on how can you live that story and not believe that america deserves our optimism deserves our courage deserves our hope buttigieg asked and in perhaps the most obama like flourish in the speech buttigieg used the jumble of his own identities a midwest mayor a married gay man an afghanistan veteran to argue that the divisions of our politics obscures the grandeur of our common humanity when i was overseas each one of the 119 trips i took outside the wire driving or guarding a vehicle we learned what it is to trust one another with our lives the men and women who got in my vehicle they didn t care if i was a democrat or a republican they cared about whether i had selected the route with the fewest ied threats not whether my father was documented or undocumented when he immigrated here they cared about whether my m 4 was locked and loaded not whether i was going home to a girlfriend or a boyfriend it was a speech aimed right at the obama wing of the democratic party down to the homage like jokes about being a young kid with a funny last name it was a speech aimed at voters who look to the future with excitement who find themselves thrilled by the word change it s time to walk away from the politics of the past buttigieg said and toward something totally different that buttigieg trusted that line to be received with applause spoke volumes about his intended audience buttigieg of course isn t running in the 2008 democratic primary he s running in the aftermath of obama s presidency in the questions raised by trump s rise and he s running in the aftermath of clinton s 2016 loss and amid the metoo moment both of which have sharpened attention on why it is that the exciting fresh new faces in presidential politics always seem to be men whether a youngish candidate is bright brilliant and promising or inexperienced off putting and ruthlessly ambitious depends on whether the young thing in question is male or female writes jill filipovic i was struck looking at the prevalence of the word fight in the 2020 announcement speeches that the top tier female candidates used it so much more than the men nor is that unique to this election in 2008 clinton used the word so often that she was mocked for it she s the fightingest fighter in the fight wrote byron york in 2016 people complained about her use fight song as the campaign theme men are assumed to be fighters which frees them up to build messaging around ideas like hope women have to overcome suspicions of weakness which means they have to be much more explicit about their willingness to fight but as anne helen petersen points out the work women do to prove themselves fighters often then gets them dismissed as aggressive or abrasive why can t they smile more as a result some liberals resent buttigieg for representing a status quo that frustrates them to them the rapturous reception he has received particularly as more qualified female candidates like elizabeth warren and kirsten gillibrand struggle shows not how much has changed but just how much has stayed the same yes pete buttigieg is a gay man and that s a big deal wrote filipovic but it s not a slur to say that he s a white man is he a white man in the exactly same mold as every other previous white male president no but being gay doesn t make him not white or not male another challenge for buttigieg is that obama didn t win just by impressing openness minded liberals he won by building a coalition between them and black voters as of yet there s little evidence of buttigieg breaking through among nonwhite voters and notably nonwhite voters aren t as sorted by the openness dimension between the parties so the messages that work for white liberals in new hampshire often fall flat with black churchgoers in south carolina still buttigieg s rapid rise carries a lesson for the rest of the democratic field democratic elites have given up on hope and change because washington is a place that dashes hopes and repulses change to them obama s messaging now seems quaint even naive at the same time democrats have been obsessed with reverse engineering how trump dominated his primary and won the election forgetting that the voters who propelled him to victory want different things in personality as well as in policy from the voters that propel democrats to victory but this is still the democratic party that elected barack obama twice and that adores him today a lot of liberals still want a candidate who sees the world the way obama did because that s the way they see the world too get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
