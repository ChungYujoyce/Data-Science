candidates would interact with their competitors president trump included throughout the two two hour events candidates interrupted attacked and occasionally aligned themselves with each other the second debate was rowdier than the first with candidates angling to make their mark amid the two who are leading polls former vice president joe biden and sen bernie sanders vt candidates focused their interactions on those they shared the night with the only mention of a candidate not on the stage came from sen elizabeth warren mass on wednesday who prompted by the moderator said she agreed with sanders on medicare for all here are a few other key highlights who talked most during the democratic debate the debate stages were crowded and the democratic field even more so fighting for recognition and speaking time many of the candidates were perfectly willing to cut each other off the 10 debaters on thursday had the advantage of seeing how their counterparts fared on wednesday and they came prepared with an even stronger interrupting game the washington post counted 53 instances of candidates interrupting each other williamson swalwell gillibrand buttigieg sanders biden bennet

swalwell sen amy klobuchar minn was the most frequent trump attacker wednesday and landed maybe the most memorable jab of the night i don t think we should conduct foreign policy in our bathrobe at 5 o clock in the morning she said thursday s debate brought more and blunter attacks against the president biden and harris led the attacks while sanders characterized trump as a pathological liar and a racist candidates came out swinging thursday night with 17 attacks directed at each other biden came to the stage with a war chest and a polling lead built long before he was required to participate in his first major debate in seven years he sustained the most direct attacks seven of any candidate california rep eric swalwell called on him to pass the torch to a younger generation sanders slammed his record on the iraq war and harris politely but firmly criticized the obama administration for its deportation of undocumented immigrants a later exchange between harris and biden was the most dramatic of both nights i do not believe you are a racist she said but it was hurtful to have heard biden tout his ability to have worked with two u s senators who were segregationists she slammed biden on opposed busing explaining why she took it personally there was a little girl in california who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day harris said and that little girl was me biden said that had been a mischaracterization of his record sanders the only other candidate in the field who previously ran for president also drew skepticism from other candidates for his insistence on single payer health care and free college the issue of border decriminalization created alliances during the first night as well one of the tensest exchanges former hud director and san antonio mayor juli n castro went hard after o rourke saying that he had not done his homework on the issue it was one of nine instances where the candidates flat out attacked each other a spat later in the debate between rep tim ryan ohio and gabbard may have been even more contentious ryan and gabbard spar over foreign policy i didn t say i didn t say squash the taliban i didn t say squash them when we weren t in there they started flying planes into our buildings so i m just saying right now we have an obligation ryan the taliban didn t attack us on 9 11 al qaeda did gabbard well i i understand ryan al qaeda attacked us on 9 11 that s why i and so many other people joined the military to go after al qaeda not the taliban gabbard i

presence of u s troops in afghanistan which gabbard called unacceptable ryan punched back invoking the 9 11 attacks gabbard pounced the issues 2020 democrats are running on according to their social media beyond the unity shown in the pointed attacks on trump several candidates also hastened to talk up their shared values the post counted 22 times candidates aligned themselves with one another on thursday biden and sanders were focal points bringing not just attacks but frequent alliances candidates aligned with these two polling leaders the most along with former president barack obama but some of these alignments notably harris kind words of biden were rhetorical devices that led to an attack 1 warren 3 sanders gillibrand 2 2 bennet 1 harris biden 1 4 swalwell 1 delaney obama 1

during wednesday s debate solidarity came during a bout of mansplaining washington gov jay inslee interrupted warren to brag shaking his fist in the air that he was the only candidate here who passed legislation to protect women s reproductive rights that led klobuchar to smile broadly and directly address the historic nature of this field i just want to say there s three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a woman s right to choose i ll start with that she and warren shared a laugh many of the other men onstage joined in candidates also aligned themselves along one of the biggest topics of the night immigration castro noted that booker warren and inslee agreed with his immigration plan which included a path to citizenship for daca recipients and the decriminalization of border crossings booker warren castro inslee ryan booker castro warren inslee ryan booker warren castro inslee ryan booker warren castro inslee ryan booker confirmed that he and castro were on the same page and twice called him a friend ryan noted that he agreed with castro s position too quiz how well do you know the democratic candidates the washington post recorded every interaction and reference during the democratic debate and categorized them as a mention attack alignment or interruption alignments and attacks were counted once per speech block unless broken up by an interaction or reference directed at someone else interruptions were counted once per attempt the top graphic shows all debate participants and other key figures mentioned more than once total speaking time was tracked on a separate page reuben fischer baum ann gerhart and kevin schaul contributed to this report
