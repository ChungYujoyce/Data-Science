today donate jeff sessions speaks at a farewell ceremony for deputy attorney general rod rosenstein at the main justice building may 09 2019 in washington dc chip somodevilla getty images jeff sessions is one step closer to returning to the us senate where he served for 20 years until donald trump tapped him as his first attorney general tuesday s primary in alabama will send sessions and former auburn football coach tommy tuberville to a run off election on march 31 that will finalize who will be the republican nominee a contest where the president s endorsement if given could prove critical in november the winner of that contest will face incumbent democratic sen doug jones who won the seat in a special election after sessions joined trump s cabinet in 2017 the top three candidates heading into tuesday were sessions tuberville and gop rep bradley byrne and all three worked to outdo the others in showing their loyalty to trump god sent us donald trump because god knew we were in trouble tuberville who has leaned hard on religious messaging said in a recent tv ad byrne trained his fire on both tuberville and sessions in one ad he claimed tuberville was fired from auburn and supports illegals in the united states while accusing sessions of letting trump down and failing to put hillary clinton in jail sessions ran his own adattacking tuberville for moving from florida to alabama to run for the seat and reminding voters of his strong support for trump in 2016 while highlighting byrne s comment that he was not fit to be president after trump s access hollywoodcomments emerged sessions enters the runoff as a known quantity across alabama with many of the advantages of incumbency but with tuberville running as an outsider trying to clean up washington and support trump voters may determine that sessions has become part of the establishment that betrayed the president who fumed over sessions recusal from the russia investigation and ultimately fired him if trump still holds a grudge and he s known to hold plenty he could endorse tuberville or pointedly sit out the race meanwhile incumbent gop sen richard shelby has endorsed sessions his longtime colleague also contending on tuesday was former alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore who lost to jones in 2017 amid accusations that he had assaulted teenage girls he finished far behind the top contenders a fierce fight is expected ahead of the runoff later this month the winner of the runoff will have a good chance of unseating jones widely viewed as the most vulnerable democrat in the senate in a state where trump is very popular among the state s gop majority subscribe to our free newsletters you expect the big picture and it s our job at mother jones to
