advertisement supported by charles m blow by charles m blow yes we re still talking about sex sigh on tuesday night during a fiery and quite frankly bizarre interview on fox news the trump supporter walking contradiction and inflated ego newt gingrich yelled at the host megyn kelly about trump s own statements about sexually assaulting women and multiple women s accusations that he had assaulted them when kelly began a question with the phrase if trump is a sexual predator newt went nuts said trump is not a sexual predator chastised her for using language that s inflammatory and claimed she was fascinated with sex this was an obscene spectacle and not only because gingrich has confessed to cheating on his wife at the same time that he was leading impeachment proceedings against bill clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice related to having an affair it was also obscene because of the continued tone deafness and abject ignorance within the trump campaign and among its allies about the canyon of difference between sex and assault sex in all its range of expressions including kissing and intimate touching is consensual any forcible touching of another person s body is sexual assault one should always be wary of people who don t intuitively recognize that difference but this would have been a blip a curiosity merely an act in the media circus if it had simply remained a squabble between television personalities but of course it didn t on wednesday donald trump couldn t help weighing in once again turning attention away from issues that could strengthen his struggling campaign and back to his monthslong quarrel with kelly and his history of issues with women at the grand opening of his new washington d c hotel trump complimented gingrich for his finger waving tantrum saying by the way congratulations newt on last night that was an amazing interview we don t play games newt right we don t play games with that statement trump elevated and endorsed gingrich s behavior and reignited the debate about trump and his campaign s dismissal of the very idea of sexual assault with that statement every woman and every parent of a daughter and sibling of a sister is forced to bring trump s braggadocio about kissing and groping women back to the fore with that statement everyone is forced to consider the vindictive side of the man who has to put it mildly a spotty track record with women trump according to his own words objectifies women prioritizes fighting and winning and fetishizes adoration we re putting aside for a moment weighty issues like his severely challenged grasp of foreign policy his reckless comments about nuclear weapons his blockheaded comments about abortion his xenophobic comments about muslims his ethno bigoted comments about mexicans and his condescending comments about the plight of black people in the inner city let s instead focus for the purposes of this discussion on character or the lack thereof let s focus on what we know about this man from the words that have come out of his own mouth let s focus on the clarity of his darkness his illusory deceptions his insatiable avarice and his colossal conceit when you view the man with clear eyes he shrinks and withers what is left when the facade is removed is a shallow narcissist who is also a misogynist bigot nativist and xenophobe that keeps coming up but that s the root of the thing we can never tire of saying that because it is in fatigue that hatred and intolerance gain a foothold that can quickly morph into a stranglehold vigilance is not optional it s obligatory just this week the new york times reported on tapes of trump recorded by the biographer michael d antonio to hear the accompanying podcast in which portions of the recordings are played along with a discussion with d antonio is to descend into the mind of an egomaniacal fame addict who is painfully un self aware even as he boasts of his own personal achievements in part one of the podcast d antonio makes this startling assertion i think he doesn t want to be understood because that would make him vulnerable but i also think that he doesn t even know himself well enough to share what he considers to be genuine his genuine reality is the most superficial one that you can imagine but in part two of the podcast d antonio delivers a devastating assessment of the man he interviewed recorded and captured in biography donald trump is a bottomless pit of need and the presidency was the only object big enough that he could imagine seizing to fill up that hole mr d antonio continued it s not going to be enough were he to win yes this is one man s assessment but it feels to me like an astute one and a fundamentally frightening one and this brings us back to his inability to resist patting gingrich on the back for his verbal tirade against kelly trump lacks not only self awareness but also self control he could have let that television exchange pass without comment and he should have but he didn t everything in him is so caught up with the idea of who he s fighting with that he doesn t seem to have a principled grasp on what he is fighting for that s not someone who should be a great nation s president that s someone who would benefit from being a great therapist s patient advertisement
