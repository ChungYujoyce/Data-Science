potential 2020 run since he exited the g o p primary last year and they haven t been subtle the ohio governor who is closing in on the end of his second and final gubernatorial term wrote a book critical of his former rival donald trump and the hyper partisanship snarling washington fortifying his foreign policy credentials with trips to germany britain and japan actively inserted himself in the policy debates roiling capitol hill most notably on health care and two of his longtime aides launched a nonprofit political organization to champion kasich s two paths narrative and highlight the bipartisan themes from his failed presidential campaign not to mention that kasich has yet to explicitly deny that he is still eyeing the oval office and now it seems kasich might have a running mate mike allen of axios reported on friday that colorado governor john hickenlooper could join kasich on the ticket in 2020 according to the report kasich and hickenlooper a democrat widely viewed as a rising star in the party might make an independent bid for the white house on a bipartisan platform to reform health care immigration and boost jobs having cultivated reputations as policy wonks kasich and hickenlooper the johns have made a series of appearances together to champion state driven health care reform both accepted obamacare s medicaid expansion the pairing of hickenlooper and kasich might seem unlikely while the two have managed to skirt partisan flash points they still fall in line with their respective political parties on most issues but the political coupling does adhere to the bipartisan message kasich has been touting since trump s inauguration particularly on health care kasich has been a vocal advocate of reaching across the aisle he and hickenlooper are expected to unveil a bipartisan plan to stabilize the obamacare exchanges as early as next week we re getting very close kasich said in a joint interview with hickenlooper on colorado public radio on monday but while kasich has been overtly bolstering his brand pitching himself as a competent outsider who can fix the gridlock in washington without taking potshots at his own party hickenlooper has been more circumspect about his political aspirations during an interview with msnbc on thursday hickenlooper said he doesn t intend to think about a presidential run until after he finishes his gubernatorial term in 2018 we re not the colorado governor responded when asked if his team was actively pursuing a campaign but he added i mean people ask me and obviously i talk about it from time to time ordinarily it might be considered early to begin stoking 2020 rumors especially for a politician potentially attacking an incumbent in his own party but with trump battling a historically low approval rating eroding support among his republican base and a rise in g o p lawmakers publicly rebuking him a handful of strategists wouldn t rule out the possibility that the president could face several primary challengers one said there would be an appetite among conservative mega donors to back an alternative if they saw a path to victory if trump even runs again trump s own pollster tony fabrizio seemed to give credence to the rumors when he released a poll showing the president in head to head contests with several possible republican presidential hopefuls which showed trump winning 50 percent of the votes the democratic national committee has already begun doing opposition research on a number of potential republican challengers including kasich nikki haley and vice president mike pence a kasich hickenlooper ticket could be the rare bipartisan pairing that manages to unite moderates in both parties at a time of growing political discord or it could manage to annoy majorities in both certainly the democratic party might not take kindly to the colorado governor playing second fiddle to his ohio counterpart on an independent ticket with no clear party leaders and a weak bench the colorado governor has been among the names floated as a possible democratic candidate no democrat wants kasich anywhere near our ticket a top strategist told axios sounds like a no labels fantasy but moderate democrats would hate it still american politics has entered an unprecedented dangerous state of disunity aggravated by the president s inflammatory rhetoric our political system is completely broken something big and historic needs to happen to break the logjam a veteran political operative wrote in an email to allen i m a big dem but i m for anything that does away with this hyper partisanship on both sides that is paralyzing our government will be used in accordance with our privacy policy until now he s managed to stay clear of the trumpian chaos and positioned for a possible presidential run but on health care and the don jr imbroglio he stumbled as one g o p strategist put it i think to some degree no matter how hard he tries to stay above the fray he is going to be forever linked to donald trump by abigail tracy not running for president john kasich doth protest too much by abigail tracy the d n c is already preparing to run against
