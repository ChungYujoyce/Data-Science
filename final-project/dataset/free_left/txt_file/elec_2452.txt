with breanne deppisch the big idea provo utah republican elected officials who continue to stand with donald trump even as a procession of women come forward to credibly accuse him of grotesque misconduct are gambling that the american people have very short attention spans they might not be wrong three years ago today the federal government was two weeks into a shutdown conservative hard liners led by sens ted cruz r tex and mike lee r utah forced congressional republicans into a quixotic showdown with the white house over the funding of obamacare as public opinion turned sharply against them establishment figures cut a deal to get the lights back on and 800 000 furloughed employees back to work at the time there was a great deal of hand wringing among gop strategists and lawmakers about the damage that the fight was doing to the party s image they feared that voters would become convinced that they were incapable of governing a washington post poll conducted immediately after the government reopened seemed to validate these worries eight in 10 americans disapproved of the shutdown and just one third of the country held a favorable view of the republican party an all time low how quickly people forget and the media moves on the disastrous rollout of healthcare gov dominated the conversation in the second half of october and public opinion swung against the democrats terry mcauliffe was expected to win the virginia governor s race by double digits but backlash to the affordable care act meant that heprevailed by only twopoints republicans won control of the senate just one year later in 2016 the shutdown has not emerged as a top tier issue against gop incumbents up for reelection in places like new hampshire florida pennsylvania or ohio largely because voters don t remember it during a senate debate here in utah last night a brigham young university student pointedly asked lee about the episode you were a supporter of shutting down the government in 2013 said junior blake ringer who interned for sen jeff flake r ariz last year under what circumstances would you support shutting down the government if reelected president obama shut down the government lee replied you ve been told otherwise by the media but they re wrong offering a revisionist explanation he spoke at one pointas if he was trying to help out the administration what we proposed is that we not fund it for that first year because president obama said it wasn t ready coasting to reelection against a 31 year old transgender woman who works as a grocery store cashier the confident senator was cool as a cucumber for most of the debate but lee got flustered every time the shutdown came up at a gaggle afterward a pair of local reporters pressed him repeatedly on whether in retrospect the gambit was a mistake there was no vote to shut down the government lee said testily after the third dodge he replied well no but i didn t let it happen to begin with what happened is they wouldn t allow us to have a single vote to fund any aspect of government unless we were willing to fund everything in government including obamacare let s face it lee will never pay any political price for his role in the shutdown democratic challenger misty snow a first time candidate made clear after the debate that she s not even running to win the best a democratic senate candidate has done in utah since 1992 is 33 percent so anything above that would be a victory of sorts she said adding that she has never even been to washington cruz for his part might never have become a plausible presidential candidate in 2016 had he not picked the fight that led to the donnybrook though in fairness he paid a price this spring when many of his republican colleagues refused to support him during a two way race with trump because they still resented the pickle he put them in remember when former house speaker john boehner called him lucifer in the flesh just as with the shutdown there are reasons to believe that many republicans will not ultimately suffer much if any long term damage from looking the other way as their party s nominee personally insulted women latinos prisoners of war the disabled gold star parents and many more trump is indeed toxic in many places in the next four weeks but if republicans lose the senate the nature of the map means they would probably retake the chamber in 2018 assume trump loses because the dire warnings about him will not have been able to materialize and our addculture will be fixated on fresher stories it seems hard to believe that trump will stay top of mind for that many voters come october 2019 the same distance in the future as the government shutdown is in the past then again it seems certain trump will find ways to stay in the limelight for as long as possible even if a private citizen and of course it is possible that republicans will lose latinos for another generation because of trump the california gop is still living with the consequences of proposition 187 from 1994 rightly or wrongly many politicians have clearly concluded that trump is a flash in the pan whose historic unpopularity will not taint them by association in future cycles they also recognize that he secured their party s nomination despite a stream of scandals and gaffesthat would have doomed any conventional candidate utah senior sen orrin hatch who has chosen to stick with trump and declinesto withdraw his endorsement despite the 2005 video offers a good illustration in order to get reelected in 2012 hatch promised that his seventh term would be his last but the 82 year old has hinted that he plans to go back on his word many in both utah and the u s capitol believe he s sticking with trump to advance this ambition a poll published yesterday by the deseret news found that 51 percent of utahns want trump to drop out including 46 percent of republicans gov gary herbert and rep jason chaffetz announced last friday that they will not vote for trump the deseret news which is controlled by the mormon church called for trump to end his candidacy the salt lake tribune endorsed hillary clinton yesterday but hatch has apparently calculated that it is too risky to upset the half of the gop electorate that wants trump to stay in he assumes no one will remember that he stood up to trump but that trump supporters might seek revenge if he snubs him especially if he somehow winds up in the reality tv star s crosshairs hatch could also in theory cite his support for trump as a wedge against chaffetz if the two hypothetically wind up squaring off in a primary he may try to argue two years from now that clinton became president because republicans did not back up their nominee lee who has refused to endorse trump said last night that he still does not know whom he will vote for but it won t be clinton he reiterated his call for the donald to step aside i asked the junior senator why other politicians such as hatch have not followed his lead in renouncing trump look everybody s got to make their own decision he said that s their judgment call to make i made mine based on principle trump for his part only came up once during the hour long debate at byu the moderator asked lee if he supports his proposed ban on muslims entering the united states no heck no absolutely not never that s a religious test the senator said as a religious minority myself as a descendent of people who were ordered excluded by the governor of missouri on october 27th 1838 i am strongly against any kind of religious test we should shun any kind of an approach that says if you belong to religion x or believe y you can t come here or you lose access to this or that we ve got

everything in its power to elect trump but as trump gets clobbered on the tv airwaves by his well funded democratic rival the rnc has been conspicuously absent an analysis of campaign finance records reveals that the committee has not spent anything on commercials boosting trump since he emerged as the party s likely nominee that s a stark departure from recent elections in 2008 and 2012 the rnc spent tens of millions of dollars on so called independent expenditures principally tv ads but also direct mail and phone banks supporting its nominees or attacking their democratic rivals by contrast
