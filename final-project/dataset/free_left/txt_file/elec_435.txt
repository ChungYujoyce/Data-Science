jeb bush is in terrible shape he s not leading many polls thoughthat s fine this early on the problem is that his fundamentals are hideous trump level hideous and in at least one case worse than trump s a cnn orc poll released wednesdaypinsjeb bush s favorablerating at 35 percent compared to 57 percent who viewhim unfavorably the only good news is that he s 30 points above water amongrepublicans 61 percent to 31 percent and republicans are the demographic that counts in a republican primary he remains underwater among tea party supporters though he s way underwater among democrats but also among independents who view him unfavorably 30 percent to 62 percent then there s ol don trump who s long held the position of candidate viewed most unfavorably thoughvery much likedby the people who do view him favorably hence the high national and early state polling numbers trump s favorability rating sits at 38 percent with hisunfavorable at 58 percent not that different from bush and then consider how each fares in a matchup with hillary clinton whose favorables aren tin such great shapeeither clinton defeats trump by sixpercentage points 51 percent to 45 percent against bush she leads byninepercentage points 52 percent to 43 percent all of which raises some questions about what exactly the gop establishment and the many many wealthy donors who have donated to bush see in him expect from him or as the new york times nate cohn puts it jeb bush is supposed to be the electable one that s why establishment donors flock to him get him past the primary by giving his super pac over 100 million with which he can slam everyone else for as long as necessary and then he can win the general election in a way that cruz or walker or trump cannot that s because jeb is supposedlythe most reasonable of the general election candidates the least beholden to ideological overreach and the one most rhetorically open armed about wooing hispanic voters into the republican coalition the only problem is that the more the public sees of jeb the more they dislike him and the thought of him becoming president that wretched 30 62 figure among independents combined with a head to head hypothetical in which he fares worse against hillary clinton than trump does would seem to throw the whole rationale behind the jeb bush campaign down the toilet which is funny because jeb bush doesn t come across as nearly as much of an asshole as many of the other candidates do he can seemmumbly or boring or stilted but not actively malevolent that he s doing so poorly among independents and that 92percentof independents know enough about him to have an opinion is likely a function of his last name bushhopes that the more he shows himself and explains his plans the more he ll be viewed as his own person he s not executing this plan especially well the smartest thing that jeb bushhasdone this year was convince a whole host of wealthy republican donors and establishment operatives to get behind his candidacyearly nowthat they ve investedso much into this candidate they re willing to stick it out well past the point at which the candidate has proven himself to be a boob jim newell covers politics and media for salon copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
