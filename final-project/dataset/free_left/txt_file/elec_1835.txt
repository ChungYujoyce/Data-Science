 off message cruz mocks trump rubio speeds through and bush lightens up a little by glenn thrush 01 29 2016 12 49 am est a republican debate without donald trump is like a fern bar without a bouncer without enforcer trump around to make everybody stutter and flinch all those nice guys in carefully pressed dress shirts were free to mouth off and pick fights with one another while the punches drew less blood the debate had an air of freedom with the oft bullied likes of rand paul and jeb bush liberated from the oppressive presence of the party s front runner advertisement the ratings for these gop trump fests have been steadily slipping so it will interesting to see whether trump s absence decreased or enhanced viewership and whether or not the unobstructed view of the other candidates solidified or undermined his position with that in mind here are five takeaways cruz why is everybody always picking on me trump claimed that fox was rude and biased against him absolutely nobody apart from the donald faithful bought that so yeah chuck the debate but he had plenty of tactical reasons to ditch the madding crowd first if the debate ratings dip as they would likely have done even if he was onstage he gets to chalk it up to his absence but the real reason he skipped out was to create a circular gop firing squad with ted cruz at the center and it worked the other candidates no dummies knew what trump was up to but they had plenty of incentive to cut the texas tea party hero down to size and they whacked cruz early and often especially on immigration and his annoying habit to them of demeaning the conservative credentials of any republican who opposed him paul was particularly cutting pointing out cruz s support for a comprehensive immigration reform compromise before hardening his position to oppose anything that smacked of amnesty what is particularly insulting though is that he is the king of saying you re for amnesty paul said everybody s for amnesty except for ted cruz but it s a falseness and that s an authenticity problem cruz responded to the attacks at times by whining and unlike trump he let the fox moderating team including chris wallace best him in several testy exchanges chris i would note that the last four questions have been rand please attack ted marco please attack ted chris please attack ted jeb please attack ted he complained to wallace who shot back with it is a debate sir then cruz unconvincingly threatened to pull a trump gosh if you guys ask one more mean question i may have to leave the stage he said he may have meant it tongue in cheek but it came off as petulant it was the worst possible time on the eve of the deadlocked iowa caucuses for cruz to stumble and trump dug the pothole rand paul reanimated the kentucky libertarian in days of yore regarded as the most interesting republican in the race has disappeared almost entirely from the presidential political consciousness and his low polling earned him ejection from the main debate stage granted readmission in iowa he made the most of it he spoke slowly and seemed to benefit most from trump s absence to launch a series of razor sharp attacks on the character of cruz and rubio and freed from the constraints of actually running to win he reverted back to his heartfelt and idiosyncratic brand of republicanism speaking passionately about issues that almost never reach the gop debate stage poverty discrimination against blacks urban economic development the evils of civil forfeiture and mandatory federal drug sentences i think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our african american community and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don t unfairly incarcerate another generation of young african american males he said chris christie just won t answer a question it s uncanny the bellicose new jersey governor who is staking all on a decent showing in new hampshire simply wouldn t address anything the moderators threw at him turning every answer into a rousing am i right guys attack on the easiest of targets hillary clinton when megyn kelly asked christie about entitlement reform the single most important element of federal deficit reduction can you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all she asked he hit a bumper sticker talking point that had zilch to do with entitlement reform how about one that i ve done in new jersey for the last six years that s get rid of planned parenthood funding from the united states of america he intoned to applause when asked how he would stop terrorists without racial profiling he dodged the policy question and punted let law enforcement make those decisions he said what guidelines they would use to make those decisions he didn t say marco rubio needed to be great not grating for months and months rubio s team opted for a low key strategy of avoiding big debate night fights to focus on his competence eloquence and mastery of semi hawkish foreign policy all that has bought the florida senator are middling poll numbers and a predicted fourth place finish in his home state in recent days however iowa republicans say he s hit a stride and have been talking up a late january surge that could upend the trump or cruz conventional wisdom but rubio seemed overly tense hyper emphatic and prone to his unflattering habit of delivering his answers in an annoying gatling gun crescendo of ever increasing volume style points like these matter rubio is well liked by voters even those who plan to vote for other candidates and his less than calm performance undermines the boyish senator s contention that he s seasoned enough for the big job by kyle cheney jeb unleashed the knock on bush in earlier debates was that he lacked the rhetorical zip and testosterone to go one on one with trump in the front runner s absence he seemed more confident and more competently combative training many of his blows at rubio in one memorable exchange bush accused rubio of choosing to cut and run from his commitment to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the senate in order to avoid the conservative backlash against supporting a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for as marco says for 30 years and then he cut and run because it wasn t popular amongst conservatives i guess bush said but he saved the most lacerating line for himself acknowledging that his own support for a citizenship pathway is a no sale in a gop increasingly tilting toward the hard line trump position which includes building a massive border wall to keep out foreigners i wrote a book about this called immigration wars he said you can get it at 2 99 on amazon it s not a bestseller i can promise you missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every
