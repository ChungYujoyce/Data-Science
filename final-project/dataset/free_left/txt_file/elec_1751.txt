every gop presidential candidate most especially those in a crowded field with lots of solid contenders needs to answer a single question why me and not one of the 20 or so other hopefuls who are running this is the second in our series looking at the unique qualifications and arguments for the 2016 gop presidential hopefuls last week we looked at wisconsin gov scott walker today we turn to sen marco rubio r fla like president obama was rubio is a first term senator with great rhetorical skills that however is where the comparison ends the argument for his candidacy can be boiled down to 10points 1 unlike obama rubio has a specific message that is more than hope and change he is a more adept salesman for the reform agenda than say rep paul ryan r wis ryan and rubio are like minded legislators who approach problems from a similar ideological perspective the difference they say is that rubio possesses the political skill to accomplish what ryan has not taking conservative reforms outside the halls of congress and selling them to a national electorate 2 he is unmistakably the face of a new generation of republicans perfectly designed to take on the social security eligible hillary clinton 3 rubio is better able than any other contender to attack clinton where she is weakest namely on her foreign policy record he understands how and where she and the president failed and can articulate a hard nosed alternative vision of u s leadership unlike other freshman senators vying for the nomination he has consistently been on the right side of tough anti terrorism measures e g support for the nsa willing to commit whatever force is needed to defeat the islamic state his knowledge of foreign policy issues and ability to outmaneuver opponents of a robust foreign policy was on display at a recent koch brothers event when he slapped down sen rand paul r fla 4 he is no novice in politics he was elected to the florida state house in 1999 and to the speakership in 2003 among other things he helped lead a property tax overhaul 5 it will be hard to pass him on the right he has an 89 percent lifetime conservative rating from heritage action and near perfect ratings from other conservative groups 6 with the exception of jeb bush he is the only fluent spanish speaker who can reach the hispanic audience without a filter and who can converse directly with spanish language media 7 he has a compelling immigrant story and the ability to identify with working people at the 2012 rnc convention he told the crowd 8 while supporting the traditional definition of marriage he does not sound like a zealot or constitutional know nothing i wouldn t agree with the supreme court ruling but that would be the law of the land that we would have to follow until it s somehow reversed either by a future supreme court or a u s constitutional amendment which i don t think is realistic or foreseeable 9 he is entirely at ease with the mainstream media as well as with conservative outlets and he is adept at using self deprecating humor 10 compared withother gop contenders rubio tends to do well withwomen voters receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
