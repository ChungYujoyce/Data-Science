venkov three companies internet research agency concord management concord catering a russian associate konstantin v kilimnik in a sprawling 37 page indictment mr mueller charged the 13 russians with conspiracy to defraud the united states and connected them with a four year effort to undermine and influence the 2016 presidential election the russians and the three companies that facilitated and funded their work are accused of using social media the identities of american citizens and politically charged topics to manipulate an already divisive campaign three of the russians were also indicted with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud and five were also charged with aggravated identity theft none of the defendants were arrested as russia rarely extradites its citizens to the united states to face legal proceedings but the indictments are designed to openly name and shame the russians in order to make it difficult for them to continue to work or travel abroad they also risk capture and extradition if they travel outside russia in june mr mueller charged mr kilimnik who he had previously referenced without identification in court documents with obstruction of justice prosecutors said mr kilimnik a russian army trained linguist helped mr manafort try to persuade other associates to lie about their work on a project related to mr manafort s ukrainian clients mr
