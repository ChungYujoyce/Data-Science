the following is a transcript of the interview with democratic sen amy klobuchar of minnesota that aired sunday june 30 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan welcome back we are now joined by minnesota senator and 2020 democratic presidential candidate amy klobuchar she joins us from minneapolis good morning senator senator amy klobuchar thanks margaret hello margaret brennan we saw this historic moment with president trump stepping into north korea and i wonder if you re commander in chief would you continue the diplomacy that he has started sen klobuchar you always have to talk to everyone when it is american security and the world s security at stake but he keeps having these summits and meetings that really don t produce anything there s been a number of them now and this time you know you just can t look at this as going over and talking to your dictator next door and bringing them a hot dish over the fence there is a lot more and what this is about is making sure that there are measurable results that we have a plan when we go in there and we just haven t seen that in fact just in may you saw north korea launch another missile into the sea in violation of the u n resolution and to me you need to have a plan to denuclearize that peninsula or at least reduce those weapons immediately and i just don t see that happening yes but yet we know that talks are good but i just don t see this president when you look at what happened in iran when he got out of that agreement and we were 10 minutes away from war and a month away from them blowing the caps when it comes to uranium enriching uranium when you look what he did with the nuclear agreement with russia he is constantly climate change pulling us back from working with our allies to try to solve these problems margaret brennan you said there north korea would denuc denuclearize or at least need to reduce their arsenal would you accept them as a nuclear power sen klobuchar i no i would not what i m saying is you need to have steps and measures and you would could start there and then of course you have dates and you have times and you have a focus and you have a plan but that is not what he does he goes and gets a letter and says i love the guy right in the face of the warmbier s who lost their son otto so i am concerned just because of the track record here talk is good but if all it is is talk it doesn t produce anything for national security for america and international security for our allies margaret brennan as commander in chief what would you do differently with china what leverage would you use to get them to capitulate on trade sen klobuchar i would first acknowledge to the american people very clearly the problem here the surveillance the intellectual property violations are basically stealing our blueprints what they have done when it comes to subsidizing industries and manipulating their currency the second thing that i would do is to work with our allies and to push them and i wouldn t have just walk away from every negotiating table months goes by i think you have to keep at it methodically and mostly i wouldn t have used the approach they ve used yes targeted tariffs but they have used basically a meat cleaver or maybe we should call it a tweet cleaver when it comes to how they re dealing with these other countries and when you talk to larry kudlow and he talked about the patriotism of our farmers i m in a very heavy ag state iowa my neighbor is a heavy ag state north dakota i ve talked to farmers in those areas and what they tell me is they re not going to get that soybean market back in one year because that market has gone to farmers in other countries and so that s why there s an urgency to this when we have an 891 billion dollar trade deficit which is the worst that we ve seen you can t just keep talking about it you actually have to get it done margaret brennan you heard me ask larry kudlow about republican senators concerns about huawei you are a sitting senator would you vote to ban american companies from doing business with them sen klobuchar i don t think we should be doing business with them right now and i agree with my colleagues not just senator rubio but also senator warner mark warner who is the ranking on the intelligence committee that this is a major security risk for america you know you look at everything from china to russia using cyber against us it is the modern warfare we certainly know that from our elections in 2016 they may not use tanks or missiles but they can go after our electric grid they can go after our security in a very different way and so i don t know why he would just give that away right now i would think that he would put firm firm standards in place as part of any agreement with china and that s not what we have we just have another promise that they re going to buy american agriculture okay that s positive but i wouldn t give it up in that short term gain for the long term where we need to protect our security and our cybersecurity margaret brennan i want to ask you about the debates this week one question to many of your colleagues and competitors was whether their health care plan would cover undocumented immigrants would your plan do that sen klobuchar as part of comprehensive immigration reform we must move forward on making sure that people have health care california just did that with medicaid and i am supportive of that but i think on the national basis as we go forward get immediate health care for people yes but as part of making this actually happen you need comprehensive immigration reform and one thing that was missing from the nbc debate actually that i hope we can discuss is that we have a humanitarian crisis at the border right now but we also did not talk about the other immigrants that are here the people who are here on temporary legal status we ve got hundreds of thousands of people that are legally here that are at risk or are being deported that work in our nursing homes and our hospitals we have got dreamers two million of them that came to this country through no fault of their own and are a major part of our economy so we need to have an economic discussion about this as well as a border discussion margaret brennan okay so sen klobuchar and that s why i want to move forward as president with comprehensive immigration reform margaret brennan so that was a yes that your health care plan would cover sen klobuchar that was a yes margaret brennan okay sen klobuchar for immediate health care needs but as far as other benefits i think we need to that has got to be a part of the discussion of comprehensive immigration reform margaret brennan okay because they were excluded from the existing obamacare law sen klobuchar that is correct yes margaret brennan so you are i mean you you you call yourself a pragmatist you re in many ways sen klobuchar yes margaret brennan perceived as a moderate from the midwest do you feel sometimes that the rest of the party is is is leaving you behind that it s sen klobuchar no margaret brennan gone so progressive sen klobuchar i think i i i think i m thinking the issues you re focused here on for instance medicare for all and i want universal health care i just got a different way to get there and as i said in the debate i don t think that we should take away people s right to their private insurance and kick half of america off of their private insurance i think there is a better way to do this and that strengthening obamacare taking on the pharmaceuticals on free college for all i made it very clear i want to expand pell grants make it easier for kids to go to college but i don t think and that s what some of these plans do that we should be using taxpayer money to finance rich kids to go to college many of our public universities something like 10 percent of the kids come from families that make over 200 000 dollars a year and i think that taxpayer money is better used to get free community college to help kids get certifications when those are some of the fastest growing degreed jobs we have in this nation and so to me this is a legitimate policy argument about how we help people afford college help them pay off their loans make bold policy changes which this president is not doing but i think there s room in our party for a legitimate debate i just think it s important to realize there s a lot more that unifies us than separate that there s a lot more that unifies us than there is that divides us and that divide right now is with the american people and the president he promised them pharmaceutical prices going down they ve gone up he promised them infrastructure he has done margaret brennan okay sen klobuchar nothing he promised them a safer world when he got out of the iranian agreement it is not safer that s the case we need to make margaret brennan all right we ll look for you on that next
