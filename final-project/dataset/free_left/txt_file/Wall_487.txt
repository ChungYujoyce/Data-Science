advertisement supported by for now my future and that of other immigrants in america remains uncertain by shahdabul faraz dr faraz is a resident physician in the department of surgery at beth israel deaconess medical center boston on april 20 i had just gotten home from a particularly difficult 14 hour shift when i saw president trump s tweet about closing the united states border to immigrants he said that he was acting as a response to the coronavirus pandemic and to protect the jobs of american citizens this was alarming news to me especially since some of the reporting on the announcement suggested that visas for highly skilled workers could also be banned as a foreign born doctor on a work visa i was very worried about how this would impact my ability to remain in the country as it turned out the executive order he ultimately signed on april 22 was more limited in scope and included exceptions for certain health care workers like me the announcement came a month after the administration halted all routine visa processing including for work visas many see these developments as further proof of the president s characteristic anti immigration stance but for me it s much more personal i grew up in bangladesh a country with a history of political unrest and massive inequality my parents wanted me to have a chance at a better future so we immigrated to canada during my formative teenage years then in 2010 i applied and got into emory university in atlanta as graduation approached i knew i wanted to continue my studies in the united states so i enrolled in medical school at cornell university in new york in the past decade i have come to view this country as my home and in the past two months i have been working to help fight a deadly virus that has devastated my city like so many others around the world i have tended to hundreds of american patients of varying races genders socioeconomic backgrounds and political affiliations every morning i wake up i prepare myself for the long inevitably exhausting day ahead i can t help but feel nervous as i walk through the now deserted streets to the hospital where i work i wonder if this will be the day i will be infected with the coronavirus i worry about being asymptomatic and unwittingly infecting my patients most of whom are elderly and have numerous medical conditions my hours are grueling the physical and mental toll unimaginable i ve begun to suffer from panic attacks i have trouble sleeping in one of the toughest moments of our careers my colleagues and i cannot properly console one another amid all this mental anguish and physical danger some of us must also contend with a government that seems to want to get rid of us i m deeply proud of the work i do even in the face of a critical national shortage of personal protective equipment but i m beginning to wonder if the citizens of this country appreciate the contribution of foreign workers like myself a 2018 quinnipiac poll found that 59 percent of republican voters said it should be harder to legally immigrate to the united states a similar 2019 quinnipiac poll found that only 49 percent of republicans believe immigration is good for the country then there are the president s actual words and policies he has previously signed an executive order to ban entry of citizens from seven primarily muslim countries his administration has enforced inhumane family separation policies at the u s mexico border he has supported legislation to cut legal immigration rates in half his anti immigration statements including his repeated use of terms like invaders with reference to foreigners have earned him praise from his staunchest supporters what mr trump and his supporters don t seem to understand is that the united states has benefited tremendously from immigration most economists agree that increases in the number of immigrants both low skilled and highly skilled ones benefit the average american citizen the popular notion that immigrants take away jobs from american citizens is false historically immigration has allowed this country to have access to the brightest minds from across the globe under mr trump s harsh immigration policies many highly skilled foreign workers are now taking their talents elsewhere for now my future and that of millions living in america and across the world remains uncertain will the ban be extended past 60 days is this clampdown on legal immigrants just the beginning will the american public fight back against this latest scapegoating of immigrants there are currently more questions than answers despite all this i remain hopeful i have no other choice it s decidedly out of my hands all i can say to mr trump and his supporters is that i am not your enemy i am one of many on the front lines fighting covid 19 on your behalf and if you happen to get sick and come to my hospital i will do everything in my power to make sure you get the best care possible even if you want me out of your country dr shahdabul faraz shahdabulf is a resident physician in the department of surgery at beth israel deaconess medical center a teaching hospital of
