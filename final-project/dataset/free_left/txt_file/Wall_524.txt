advertisement supported by his confirmation hearing was the first to employ social distancing rules for senators since the coronavirus pandemic took hold transcript these firings and forced departures from the leadership of the intelligence community have left the o d n i without a single senate confirmed leader at the helm that while i m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt during this hearing i don t see what has changed since last summer when the president decided not to proceed with your nomination over concerns about your inexperience partisanship and past statements that seemed to embellish your record if confirmed as d n i you have my commitment to deliver timely accurate and objective intelligence and to speak truth to power be that with congress or within the administration let me be very clear regardless of what anyone wants our intelligence to reflect the intelligence i will provide if confirmed will not be impacted or altered as a result of outside influence there are some very experienced analysts within the i c that are concerned that you might attempt to shade the conclusions in order to avoid alienating the president i won t shade intelligence for anyone my loyalty is to the constitution and the rule of law and i have made that very clear to everyone including the president by julian e barnes and nicholas fandos washington representative john ratcliffe president trump s pick to lead the nation s intelligence agencies sought at his confirmation hearing on tuesday to push past questions about his qualifications and fierce partisanship promising senators he would deliver unvarnished facts to a skeptical white house but when pressed by members of the senate intelligence committee mr ratcliffe republican of texas resisted taking sides on many of the most contentious intelligence matters that have divided trump era washington and could offend the president including whether russia specifically sought to aid mr trump s campaign in 2016 and whether the president should have fired the inspector general for the intelligence agencies pressed repeatedly by democrats mr ratcliffe conceded that he disagreed with mr trump that the intelligence agencies had run amok but he declined to further quibble with the president in favor of more general assertions of independence if confirmed as d n i one of the things that i ve made clear to everyone is that i will deliver the unvarnished truth mr ratcliffe said in one exchange with senator susan collins republican of maine and the panel s key swing vote it won t be shaded for anyone what anyone wants the intelligence to reflect won t impact the intelligence that i deliver but republicans including ms collins greeted mr ratcliffe s responses more amicably and appeared poised to push his nomination forward in the interest of installing a permanent intelligence chief at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is threatening social economic and political systems around the world they were also warmer to mr ratcliffe than they were last summer when mr trump first put him forward for the job but then backtracked amid bipartisan criticism of his record senator richard m burr republican of north carolina and the committee s chairman said after the hearing that he would hold a committee vote next week to advance mr ratcliffe and work with senate leaders to schedule a final confirmation vote shortly thereafter there were no questions that he sidestepped today mr burr said he answered everything and i think he did a very successful job at verifying that he is more than capable of this job and serve in an independent capacity the public vetting played out in almost surreal fashion as senators back in session for their first hearing in a month took precautions to limit the spread of covid 19 the disease caused by the coronavirus in a mostly empty room mr ratcliffe sat on nearly the opposite end from the senators much farther back than hearing witnesses typically sit of those present many wore masks including mr burr and senator mark warner of virginia the panel s top democrat who pulled them down around their necks as they spoke the public was not allowed inside if confirmed mr ratcliffe will take charge of the intelligence community at a tense time with the white house pushing for information about the origin of the coronavirus pandemic and a president who has openly disparaged the agencies since they publicly concluded at the start of 2017 that russia developed a preference for mr trump s candidacy as it conducted a widespread operation to interfere in the 2016 presidential election mr ratcliffe won the white house s attention through his fierce defense of mr trump and his questioning of elements of the intelligence community and he later served as a member of the president s impeachment defense team but mr ratcliffe insisted on tuesday that he relished a chance to shift from partisan warrior to neutral fact collector at the head of the intelligence agencies a transition that would most likely be necessary to win over the agencies themselves i wanted this job because it is apolitical and i have held apolitical positions before he said citing his time as a u s attorney for eastern texas mr trump first proposed installing mr ratcliffe in the job last summer only to abruptly rescind the plan after lawmakers questioned mr ratcliffe s lack of experience and partisan record in the house and after news media reports highlighted several instances in which mr ratcliffe appeared to inflate or distort aspects of his r sum if confirmed mr ratcliffe would replace the acting intelligence director richard grenell an aggressive trump defender who has moved to remake the office during his interim assignment while he also continues to serve as ambassador to germany he has prompted unease among key senate republicans including mr burr according to officials involved in the confirmation process but making clear that democrats were displeased with mr ratcliffe s nomination mr warner said that he needed more sufficient reason to vote to confirm him no matter how uncomfortable lawmakers are with mr grenell some have suggested that your main qualification for confirmation to this post is that you are not ambassador grenell mr warner said but frankly that is not enough mr warner is among the influential democrats who have signaled that they see mr ratcliffe as summarily unprepared for a position that has been filled by military veterans and seasoned national security officials mr ratcliffe spent part of four years as a federal prosecutor in texas under president george w bush and has served in the house since 2015 including one term on its intelligence committee transcript from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today despite reservations from its own doctor the senate reconvened on monday nick fandos on why one chamber of congress is so determined to return to washington it s wednesday may 6 nick give us the scene inside the u s capitol on tuesday morning so it s a totally surreal setup particularly for those of us that are used to watching congress in a wood paneled hearing room across the street from the capitol which would usually be full of people getting ready to watch senators question a witness instead you had a totally empty room eerily quiet just a few senators gathered at one side wearing masks they ve got pumps of hand sanitizer at the ready totally at the other side of the room maybe 20 or 30 feet away is a witness who s ready to give them testimony how are you sir living the dream you they wave across the room welcome to our socially distanced richard burr the chairman and mark warner the top democrat throw out their elbows for a little bit of an elbow bump but there s none of the usual energy that we d see on a typical weekday morning in the capitol and what exactly is happening in this very weird sounding scene what was playing out was a confirmation hearing in this case of john ratcliffe who s a republican congressman and a loyal supporter of president trump who s now his nominee to be the director of national intelligence to oversee the country s 17 intelligence agencies skip you ready right at 9 30 richard burr who s the chairman of the committee pulled down his mask and revealed a scraggly uncharacteristic beard that evidently he d been growing over the last month i mean who hasn t exactly and gavel smack i call this hearing to order called the hearing into session this hearing will be a little bit different it is perhaps the first congressional hearing held during the extenuating circumstances of the pandemic we have a sparse crowd and an expanded dais reflective of the committee s adherence to the guidelines put forth by the rules committee and the attending physician you know senators had certain social distancing requirements they were spaced out around the room and only allowed to come in to ask their questions in small waves but without any of the kind of normal energy or tension or cross talk that we might be used to in a high profile congressional hearing like this this is basically like a socially distant version of the united states senate at work yes i wish i could also welcome your wife michelle and your daughters riley and darby but given our attempts to minimize the number of people in the hearing room i send them my appreciation via c span and it was not very compelling tv laughter nick everything about this hearing that you re describing sounds labored and surreal and risky right i mean it s a confirmation hearing it s not a pandemic relief bill it s not a hospital funding bill so why is this even happening in this way in person you know a lot of senators were asking themselves that question in the last few days as they prepared to come back to washington as well and the answer really goes back more than a month when at the end of march senators found themselves staring down this increasingly dire situation wall street is about to close any minute now the dow collapsing its worst single day loss ever ohio and illinois shutting down restaurants and bars today the problem is job losses are adding up and it is across the country and it is in all sectors out front now jim bianco and so the house and senate republicans and democrats did what they rarely do the senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package they set aside their own kind of partisan interests and issues and very quickly put together this massive 2 trillion health and economic relief bill that they passed almost unanimously in the house and unanimously in the senate right to all americans i say help is on the way big help and quick help and then basically out of concern for their own health and safety they left town and they didn t know when they were going to come back they didn t know if it d be a couple of weeks or a month and almost as soon as they did lawmakers in both chambers start to debate when and how do we get back to washington and get back to doing this thing there s kind of a few rounds of debate but it really comes to a head basically last week at the very end of april when both the leaders of the house and senate come out and say congress will be back in session next month may 4 that s according to a tweet from house majority leader steny hoyer s press office senate majority leader mitch mcconnell made a similar announcement regarding his we re going to come back on monday may 4 and we re going to try getting back to normal as best we can but some house democrats say that they are worried about the spread of covid 19 at the capitol and some say for the house as soon as they announced that decision they immediately started getting pushback from some of their members who were saying it s not safe for us to come back we re not ready any decision that we have about when we come back rests with the staff sergeant of arms and the capitol physician democratic leaders in the house consulted congress s top doctor who told them it really wouldn t be wise at this point to bring congress back into session and so not 24 hours after they announced that they would be coming back the u s house of representatives on tuesday changed course on its decision the house reversed itself and said no we re going to stay out of session indefinitely until conditions have improved and we feel that we need to take action on some meaningful legislation hmm but the senate comes to a very different decision meanwhile senate leadership maintains the upper chamber will be back to work as usual on may 4 they have much the same medical advice they work on the other half of the capitol building from the house and mitch mcconnell who is the top republican and basically sets the schedule in the senate he calls the shots says that we re going to come back into session and what are the implications of that decision by mcconnell practically speaking to reconvene the senate so on the one hand the senate is a pretty small body it s 100 senators two thirds of them are over the age of 60 so they are at an elevated risk but the real impact when you start to think about it is there s this huge network of support staff basically behind each senator and the institution as a whole there s cooks that run dining service there s people that keep the capitol clean there s capitol police stationed everywhere to keep everyone safe there are all kinds of jobs that you just wouldn t think about and so the decision to bring an institution like the senate back into session ripples outward and could impact hundreds if not 1 000 or more people and what exactly is mcconnell s stated rationale for doing this i mean given that the house has said it s too great a risk right what is his argument for why 100 senators from 50 different states have to get on planes and return to washington well mcconnell essentially says after more than a month away there is a lot of work piling up for the senate that it would normally be doing and mcconnell essentially puts senators in league with frontline workers if it s essential that brave health care workers grocery store workers truck drivers and many other americans continue to carefully show up for work then it s essential that their u s senators carefully show up ourselves and support them you know if we re asking doctors and health professionals and grocery store workers and other government employees to go out and put themselves at risk every day to show up for work we ought to be doing that too the senate is integral to responding to this crisis and if we take the right precautions they can do it safely enough to justify being there so basically his case is we re all in this together that s right but i think the reality underpinning that is a little bit more complicated and it has to do both with politics and with the aspirations of a lot of republicans and government leaders we ll be right back so nick what are these more complicated and unspoken reasons why mitch mcconnell would want to bring the senate back into session many senators in his republican caucus come from states like georgia and texas and florida that are run by republicans and are kind of at the forefront of starting to reopen where governors and state leaders are trying to convince their citizens to get back to normal that things can reopen the economy can restart and senators want to be a part of that too these republicans feel like maybe we can model getting back to work we can show people that if we take the right precautions if we wear masks and socially distance we can continue or get back to doing this work and we don t have to be cowed by fear we can start to reinvigorate parts of society and if government can do that business could do that too that s not to say other parts of the country shouldn t move more slowly right but we can lead by example right and there s a certain logic to that as well as i guess credibility if the senators are doing this and taking the risk and showing people it s possible then it s not just them saying it s good enough for you they re saying it s actually good enough for me yeah they have a certain amount of skin in the game albeit better protected skin than a lot of frontline workers probably do but it seems to me basically a kind of optimistic view that this can be done we don t have to stay inside forever now something else has been kind of going on here in the last month that is layered on top of this and that is the kind of political impact of the pandemic the new york times reporting that republican governors are growing more concerned about president trump s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and how it could shape the results of the november election president trump has seen internally and public polls have shown that his standing against joe biden nationally and in key swing states has grown shakier over the last several weeks of a 17 state survey commissioned by the republican national committee which found that trump is struggling in the electoral college battleground and is likely to lose without signs of an economic rebound this fall there s been polls coming out of key battleground senate races across the country that may decide the senate majority that show democrats knocking on the door of the republicans or in some cases opening up significant leads there were fundraising reports that showed democrats outraising republican incumbents for three years president trump and republicans in the house and senate have pinned a lot of their political hopes on the economy and the kind of upward march of the stock markets and of wages and the coronavirus has wiped that out and so there is and has been over the last several weeks i think a real uneasiness settling in among republicans and nobody has a better finger on the political pulse particularly of senate races than mitch mcconnell and how does the senate returning to washington begin to change any of that dire data from republicans that you just ticked through one of the best things that republicans running for re election who are in office right now can do to make a positive impression on their constituents is look like they re at work help put in place programs and policies and solutions that help the country through this going back to work in washington being seen as doing their job as kind of leaders for the country could prove very helpful politically right so the thinking is that the worst possible situation for a republican senator in a state where polling shows the president down and perhaps a competitive race coming up in the fall the worst thing would be getting stuck at home unable to look like a lawmaker at this moment yeah there are certain things that these senators have been able to do from home connecting by phone or zoom with constituents but it s lower profile and certainly they would not want to be accused of sitting on the sidelines while thousands of americans are dying a day when millions of americans are losing their jobs so from everything you re saying there s not really in the minds of the republican leadership all that much downside to bringing senators back other than perhaps exposure to the virus sure and there is some risk of that bringing senators back into the capitol and their staff mingling lawmakers have contracted the virus before but they have basically judged that that risk is low enough that it s worthwhile that there s too many other reasons varied as they may be to be in session not to right so that explains why all these senators are going in and out of that room in these kind of weird waves with masks on and all that purell for this confirmation hearing and i m curious did it end up playing out as republicans had hoped senator harris thank you mr chairman it looked really bizarre but at the end of the day this hearing basically worked out well for republicans hm why do you believe that president trump has accurately conveyed the severity of the threat of covid 19 to the american people congressional hearings like this are often adversarial i guess i m misunderstanding i m sorry has he accurately reflected the status of the pandemic conveyed the severity of the pandemic yes and it s about trying to pin a nominee into an unflattering statement or expose something about their background has he accurately conveyed the severity of covid 19 to the american people i believe so you do and in this case democrats really struggled because they were cycling in and out of the room because ratcliffe was so physically far away from them to really kind of build any momentum or any tough critical picture of him it was just a kind of diffused stretched out atmosphere and republicans lined up in support and they have the majority so at the end of the day they re probably going to be able to get their guy through so it went quite well for republicans it did i want to thank you john for your time this morning i want to thank the members for working under this temporary construct at the end of the hearing the chairman richard burr pulled down his mask again and essentially announced that he would support the nominee i look forward to advancing your nomination rapidly and to voting in favor of your confirmation in the full senate he felt confident enough that he ll hold a vote in his committee next week and the full senate could be voting within a couple of weeks to install this kind of loyal defender of president trump as the head of the nation s intelligence apparatus so as well as that went i m curious what happens if over time as the pandemic persists if the polling for republicans ends up staying pretty bad and they have ultimately come to washington for nothing or in an even worse scenario they come to washington and members get sick and maybe staff gets sick and it really looks bad for the party and all of this ends up kind of backfiring will it have seemed at all worth it there is a lot of different directions that things could go in but there is one benefit that basically gets locked in as long as they are in session and holding votes and it s one that mcconnell has always been attuned to and sees as the kind of first obligation of the senate and that is confirming nominees for the executive branch and in particular lifetime appointments to the federal courts and so the way to think about this perhaps is that if republicans political prospects are looking unfavorable at the moment if they don t recover then these may be the final months of a republican majority in the senate this may be the final opportunity to continue the kind of record streak of putting judges on the bench that will shape the law and policy in this country for a generation to come to move those things through and that s not an opportunity that republicans want to pass up on either case in point one of the first actions that the senate is going to be taking when its back is setting up a bunch of additional district court judges all over the country and democrats can complain about it and gripe about it and they have they ve argued that senators shouldn t be taking the risk of being back here unless all of their actions are laser focused on the coronavirus and the response and overseeing the trump administration s implementation of their relief programs et cetera but ultimately the majority wins on this stuff and i think that mcconnell feels time is of the essence so there s a version of this where things do keep going south for republicans and their response is to just keep crashing these confirmations through and in the process cement their legacy in this last set of months that they may have the majority if they can show in these next couple weeks that there s a way to safely function by putting in place different precautions then yeah even in the very worst case scenario for republicans where they don t do any additional coronavirus legislating where their political prospects continue to dwindle and they re going to lose the majority there s only upshot in staying in town and filling up every last court seat in every corner of the trump administration that might still be able to eke out some republican conservative policy wins before november because if they don t if they leave town none of those things are possible and they essentially cede back the power of their majority in what may be the last weeks and months that they can really exercise it thank you nick thank you so much for having me we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today but i m thrilled to be here in the fantastic state of arizona i love arizona with the incredible crew i had some good moments here especially on election day on tuesday during an event at a plant in arizona president trump said that the white house task force on the coronavirus would be shut down and replaced with something else which he said he was not yet ready to describe don t you need to continue to meet with the task force to get this scientific expertise well yeah we will have certain people as an example we have hospitals that we built we have medical centers that we ve built we have people on the task force that focus on that asked why he was winding down the task force now in the middle of the pandemic the president offered no clear explanation but said that the key doctors on it like dr deborah birx would still be involved in the response are you saying mission accomplished no no not at all the mission accomplished is when it s over the times reports that the decision will only intensify questions about the ability of the white house to confront a public health crisis that has already killed more americans than the u s wars in vietnam iraq and afghanistan combined that s it for the daily i m michael barbaro see you tomorrow mr ratcliffe treaded carefully when discussing his views of russia s continuing election interference campaign they have a goal of sowing discord and they have been successful of sowing discord he said of russian government officials but he insisted that their 2016 interference had not altered the outcome of the presidential election though his assertion dovetails with mr trump s insistence that he won the election on his own it is impossible to say whether russia s sabotage campaign changed any votes john sipher a former c i a officer took issue with mr ratcliffe s assertion that the russian interference campaign changed no votes this is false mr sipher wrote on twitter the ic made clear that it does not look into or opine on this issue lawmakers pressed mr ratcliffe to allow election security officials to stay in their jobs and continue to brief congress a report about one such update to the house intelligence committee by the administration s election security czar helped prompt mr trump to replace joseph maguire as the acting intelligence chief and eventually nominate mr ratcliffe lawmakers have said they are worried the controversy over that briefing will cause the intelligence agencies to limit what they tell congress when mr warner pressed mr ratcliffe for his views of the intelligence community s assessment that president vladimir v putin of russia developed a preference for mr trump the nominee demurred saying he had not seen the underlying intelligence and could not make a determination on his own mr trump has consistently questioned the finding but the senate intelligence committee unanimously endorsed it in a report last month you want to have it both ways you want to try to portray yourself as a defender of the constitution and then you water it down with specifics senator ron wyden democrat of oregon said in exasperation after pushing mr ratcliffe for his views on whistle blower laws mr ratcliffe pledged to make gathering information on the origin of the coronavirus a top priority senior trump administration officials have pushed the spy agencies for evidence to support an unproven theory that the virus was accidentally leaked from a lab in china prompting concern among analysts that the officials will distort assessments about the virus as they escalate a campaign to blame china for the pandemic the intelligence agencies have found no conclusive evidence about the virus s origin mr ratcliffe apparently anxious to please all of the senators bounced back and forth between appearing to back the republican or democratic view of the intelligence around the origin of the outbreak senator angus king of maine an independent who caucuses with the democrats asked mr ratcliffe whether he had seen evidence pointing to the lab as the source of the virus mr ratcliffe said he had not but then senator tom cotton republican of arkansas took up questioning arguing the virus could not have originated in a public market a conclusion mr ratcliffe also agreed with mr cotton pressed mr ratcliffe to agree that the president is allowed to set intelligence priorities which he did a moment later mr king said that presidents often want intelligence to support their policy goals which he labeled conclusion shopping mr ratcliffe once more agreed emily cochrane contributed reporting
