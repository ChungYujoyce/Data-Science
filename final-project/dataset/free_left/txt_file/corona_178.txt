ramping up testing for the virus trump put the burden back on them the states have to step up their testing trump defended his tweets later on friday saying he was very comfortable with the posts he accused the three states of doing too much and said he was not worried about those protesting against stay at home orders despite the fact demonstrators have defied the administration s social distancing guidelines trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to see businesses reopen quickly and claimed earlier this week that he possesses total authority over the matter even though the lockdowns and other social distancing measures have been imposed by state and local leaders not washington dc some states did take some of the nation s first small steps towards loosening restrictions

president s tweets but on fighting a biological war i do not have time to involve myself in twitter wars said northam who is a medical doctor i will continue to make sure that i do everything that i can to keep virginians safe and to save lives the clash between trump and cuomo was personal with the president complaining the governor has not expressed his thanks for the help received from the federal government cuomo countered by saying i don t know what i m supposed to do send a bouquet of flowers thank you to the federal government for participating in a federal emergency even in largely rural states with small populations such as wyoming maine and south dakota governors said they were not anxious to quickly resume business as usual until we ve got the testing up to speed which has
