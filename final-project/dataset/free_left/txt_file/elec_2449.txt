former hewlett packard chief questions hillary clinton s record in hunt for female voters and startup cash on campaign trail but ex colleagues insist fiorina didn t know what she was doing rory carroll in los angeles and rupert neate in new york sun 3 may 2015 19 14bst first published on sun 3 may 2015 14 07bst when carly fiorina launches her campaign for president this week her message to the world will be emphatic what she did for hp she can do for america from spaghetti dinners in new hampshire to startup conferences in new york the former head of hewlett packard is expected to keep staking her claim as a pioneering executive prodigy it is only in the united states of america that a young woman can start as a secretary and become ceo of the largest technology company in the world she recently posted on facebook next to a low rating from a pro choice group that she called a badge of honor fiorina 60 has never held public office a 2010 run for us senate collapsed amid images of private jets and million dollar yachts now she hopes the revived record of a dot com businesswoman will vault her over the otherwise all male republican field of mostly professional politicians or at least lead to a spot as one of their vice presidential running mates to face hillary clinton head on we went from a market laggard to market leader fiorina has said of her six years running the computer giant unlike hillary i have actually accomplished something but those who watched what fiorina did to hp mishandling the 25bn acquisition of compaq getting ousted by the board in 2005 with a 21m golden parachute repeatedly being named one of the worst ceos in american corporate history say those supposed accomplishments are already coming back to haunt her run for the white house she put herself ahead of the interests of the company and i fear she would do the same as president jason burnett a grandson of the late hp co founder david packard and a member of the packard foundation board of trustees told the guardian i don t want her to do harm to this country hp s longtime director of corporate communications roy verley said his ex boss alienated colleagues with a cult of carly that put self promotion first she didn t know what she was doing and couldn t deliver on her promises said verley who left hp in 2000 the notion of a successful fiorina reign at hp he said was fantasy burnett echoing criticisms from more hewletts and packards alike warned the emergent class of political bankrollers in silicon valley already courted by fiorina s competitors like rand paul and jeb bush and soon clinton herself to refresh their memory before signing campaign checks leslie shedd press secretary for carly for america defended fiorina s tenure at hp saying she doubled revenue tripled innovation quadrupled cash flow and bequeathed a stronger company under carly s leadership hp weathered the 2001 economic recession that shuttered some of the top tech companies in silicon valley shedd said carly fiorina made the tough decisions that were necessary to reform the company and hp and its shareholders reaped the rewards of those decisions after she left shedd cited tech players such as investor tom perkins and craig barrett former chairman of the board at intel who defended fiorina s handling of the compaq merger she said fiorina had had to deal with a dysfunctional board at hp and disputed the credibility of lists ranking her boss as one of america s worst ceos those lists are based on no metrics shedd said are completely the opinion of whomever is compiling the list and are nothing other than gossip but political scientists and technology bankrollers agreed that even a woman focused folksy outsider meets business insider campaign would struggle to shrug off cobwebby boardroom battles predating the facebook era and re emerge as much more than a longshot she takes the silicon valley motto that it s ok to fail a tad too literally wrote the usually sober editorial board of the san jose mercury news in calling for more women in politics except carly fiorina little of fiorina s boom and bust time at hp appears to have registered in the republican heartland where she has been working on an invisible campaign for months touting her ostensibly humble origins and an only in america backstory the texas born daughter of an artist and a federal judge she studied philosophy and medieval history at stanford and worked as a secretary and receptionist before joining at t as a trainee manager fiorina zoomed up the ranks and in 1999 hp poached her to become the first woman to lead a fortune 50 company the pay perks and egalitarian ethos elicited fierce employee loyalty but the silicon valley behemoth needed a bold new leader that is often where fiorina s horatio alger style narrative ends on the campaign trail and where the pro life pro guns pro god social conservatism begins while insisting that clinton can t play the gender card against her fiorina has further burnished her conservative appeal by challenging the democratic frontrunner s credentials she has not accomplished much fiorina said of the former secretary of state at a campaign stop last month in iowa i have sat across the table from vladimir putin obviously i ve never negotiated a nuclear deal with iran she said at a recent breakfast hosted by the christian science monitor but i ve negotiated a lot of deals the dual appeal i m not a political neophyte but i m also not a professional politician appears to have won over voters in early battleground states such as iowa and new hampshire but an associated press poll released over the weekend suggests she may have many deals yet to make just 7 of those surveyed had a favourable view of fiorina and a full three quarters said they did not know enough about her people out there are not troubled by the fact i have not held elected office fiorina told a conservative audience in washington on saturday even if fiorina s presidential run ends as a way to the vice presidency campaign watchers say her six years at hp will shape voter perceptions and not to her advantage said melinda jackson a politics professor at san jose state university it was a rocky tenure i think it will haunt her critics recall that hp s board accused her of destroying the company s value by mishandling the compaq takeover a move that committed hp to making low margin personal computers rather than focusing on higher margin products such as printers the company was sued by its shareholders who argued she didn t deserve such a massive severance package ben rosen the former chairman of compaq said fiorina simply did not have the skills to manage one of the world s largest technology companies under fiorina hp revenue more than doubled from 42bn in sales to 87bn but net earnings fell to 2 4bn from 3 1bn the unlocking potential project fiorina s new initiative to help close the gender gap and recruit more independent women backers describes her achievements at hp as including market leadership in every market and product category and quadruple cash flow but hp stock tumbled 50 during her tenure and leaped 6 9 the day after her departure burnett the packard grandson said those financial realities create a dilemma for an ardent advocate of a free market advocate what can she say the market was mistaken five years after the ouster when fiorina began her first bid for public office and challenged barbara boxer for her california senate seat his sister arianna wrote a letter fiorina the heiress warned three republican senators who had endorsed the former ceo was spinning her record at hp and arianna packard accused her of using the golden parachute for financing her campaign a llow me to disillusion you of a few of your stated reasons for supporting her packard wrote most business commentators consider fiorina s tenure at hp to be a disaster boxer defeated fiorina resoundingly thanks in large part to devastating attack ads one intoned as ceo of hp carly fiorina laid off 30 000 workers fiorina shipped jobs to china and while californians lost their jobs fiorina tripled her salary bought a million dollar yacht and five corporate jets carly fiorina outsourcing jobs out for herself republican rivals for the 2016 nominating fight may borrow that playbook from 2010 said bill whalen a hoover institution research fellow who advises california s top republicans i can see a super pac doing the same to her in the primary whalen said hers is not an easy story to tell after spending last week in new hampshire fiorina will roll out her candidacy via social media on monday followed by media interviews a campaign booklet called my leadership journey and an address to the techcrunch disrupt conference in new york where she will seek to regain confidence from a startup world she left behind on the wrong side of a bubble but her bid for the white house is already being cast by many politicos as a bid for redemption to banish the ignominy from her hp departure activists and donors are watching closely to see if she can still lure campaign financing out of a carly for america fundraising operation already drawing scrutiny from federal officials i was in junior high i don t know what happened at hp said aaron ginn the co founder of san francisco based lincoln labs a lobbying group that enlists an increasingly influential and rich group of silicon valley entrepreneurs wading into the world of donations with politics that are a blend of socially open minded libertarianism and new school republicanism speaking in a personal capacity and without endorsing any candidate ginn said he liked fiorina s conviction and philosophical underpinnings he shrugged off the attacks on her as standard electoral fare you can find a hater anywhere he said but as the clintons discovered with whitewater and now everything from email servers to charitable donations us presidential campaigns can shine harsh sustained spotlights on old events just ask john kerry about that swift boat and the vietnam war fiorina s admirers see presidential attributes in the tenacity and confidence of an executive willing to confront the future if not quite all of her past her incredibly smart passionate articulate qualities shone some years ago said carl guardino a former hp executive who is now ceo of the silicon valley leadership group when she accepted his invitation to address an audience of mostly underprivileged latina girls she was mesmerising guardino said verley the former communications director at hp said fiorina s self confidence may have led to boardroom fiasco and that historical fantasy may yet help fiorina make an impact on the most crowded republican field in years and be a thorn in clinton s side she s a born politician he said she s extremely confident of her ability to step into any situation and command it
