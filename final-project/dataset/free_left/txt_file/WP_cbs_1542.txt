south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg he s one of twenty four democrats running for president we ll also talk with the chairman of the house intelligence committee adam schiff plus as the 2020

ll kick off the 2020 cbs news battleground tracker with a look at where the field stands in the early primary and caucus states and what matters most to democrats when it comes to finding their nominee plus we ll have analysis on all the political news of the week just ahead on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation we begin today with the increasing tensions between the u s and iran and secretary of state mike pompeo good morning mister secretary and happy father s day mike pompeo secretary of state secpompeo thank you good morning margaret brennan we ve had a series of events in past days the attacks on the tankers and these reports of a missile being fired at a u s drone how is the u s going to respond mike pompeo margaret i think you have to put it in the context of forty years of behavior inside the islamic republic of iran this is this is consistent with how they have behaved previously they did it when they were in the jcpoa they built their missile program we relieved sanctions they took american sailors hostage this is a regime that has caused much trouble around the world the last forty days we ve seen a number of activities not just these past two but four other commercial ships which challenged the international norms of freedom of navigation the united states is considering a full range of options we have briefed the president a couple of times we ll continue to keep him updated we are confident that we can take a set of actions that can restore deterrence which is our mission set margaret brennan you say a full range of options does that include a military response mike pompeo of course of course the president will consider everything we need to do to make sure right but what s the president said we don t want iran to get a nuclear weapon the previous administration put them on a pathway that virtually guaranteed that they could get there so we withdrew from the ridiculous jcpoa and are moving ourselves towards a set of policies which will convince iran to behave simply like a normal nation and so you ve seen them attacking international waterways trying to frankly drive up the price of crude oil around the world so that the world will cry uncle and allow iran to margaret brennan why would they do that if they re so cash strapped and they need these customers why would they attack them mike pompeo because iran can t sell its crude oil we have stopped them from doing that we have put sanctions in place that have taken them from roughly 2 7 ma barrels per day million barrels per day with american sanctions margaret brennan centcom released this video of purporting to show an irgc revolutionary guard patrol boat pulling up alongside these vessels and removing a mine from the hull of the ship how certain are you that this is the irgc and will you take that evidence and present it to our allies and the united nations mike pompeo of course we will margaret brennan when mike pompeo and and we don t just purport that s what that video is this was this was taken from an american camera this is the stuff this is the real data yes we ve shared it with allies already you ve had the chance to see it i made a bunch of phone calls yesterday i ll make a whole bunch more calls today the world needs to unite against this threat from islamic republic of iran margaret margaret margaret brennan and is the irgc mike pompeo yes margaret margaret brennan definitely the revolutionary guard corps mike pompeo it it it is and and margaret i ll remind you too china gets over eighty percent of its crude oil transiting through the strait of hormuz south korea japan these nations are incredibly dependent on these resources we re prepared to do our part we always defend freedom of navigation we are going to work to build out a set of countries that have deep vested interest in keeping that strait open to help us do that margaret brennan so when you talk about military response you re talking about that keeping the waterways open you are not at this point talking about a strike on iran mike pompeo oh goodness president trump has said very clearly he doesn t want to go to war at the same time we ve made very clear that margaret brennan do you have the legal authorization for a strike on iran mike pompeo we we always have the au authorization to defend american interests remember they now have attacked u s aircraft they on june sixth there was a missile fired from yemen with that we assessed had iranian assistance that took down an mq 9 aircraft these are attacks on fundamental international norms and now on american interests and we always have the right to defend our country margaret brennan but i ask you because there are questions about whether the existing authorization for use of military force the aumf would actually include a strike on iran mike pompeo sure margaret brennan are you confident that you could go and not have to ask congress for permission to take action mike pompeo margaret i i don t want to get into hypotheticals but the american people should be very confident the actions that the united states takes under president trump will always be lawful always consistent with our constitution and we will always do the hard task it takes to protect american interests wherever they are margaret brennan but do you need congress s permission mike pompeo to to do what margaret i mean depend you i i don t know how to answer the question in the abstract permission margaret brennan well you said a range of options are being looked at mike pompeo yes every every option we look at will be fully lawful margaret brennan well i want to ask you that because when you were trying to lay out this case as you know some allies have said that video released was not enough to convince them with the exception of the u k and saudi arabia some allies are saying we need to see more and hear more from the united states president trump as you said he campaigned against middle east wars but there is also this perception that the administration is spoiling for this fight you were a vocal critic when you were in congress mike pompeo mm hm margaret brennan of the nuclear deal you called the jcpoa earlier the national security adviser right now is one of the architects of the 2003 war in iraq according to the latest economist poll fifty one percent of americans say the president is not honest versus thirty three who say he is if you ve a credibility gap that is going to be hard for you to sell something to the american public how do you resolve that mike pompeo margaret we re not selling anything these these are simple facts i ve had many conversations over the past frankly weeks talking about iran s activity no one doubts the dataset i haven t i haven t heard a single person say they think margaret brennan the german foreign minister said the video was not enough mike pompeo the german foreign minister has seen a great deal more than just that video he will continue to see more i will concede there are countries that just wish this would go away and they want to act in a way that is counterfactual no one disputes that this is the islamic republic of iran taking these actions to deny this international right away waterway and the freedom of navigation that is a fundamental right of every country to travel through that no i ve seen no one deny it and i m confident that as we continue to develop the fact pattern countries around the world will not only accept the basic facts which i think are indisputable but will come to understand that this is an important mission for the world margaret brennan one of the things when you re at the podium at the state department earlier this week you presented as a fact was an attack that was carried out in kabul in may mike pompeo mm hm margaret brennan the taliban said they carried it out but you blamed iran for it what evidence do you have that iran was behind that attack mike pompeo margaret in that same statement the taliban said they killed ten people i would suggest to you that the credibility of the taliban is not something you ought to bring onto your show we i i i margaret brennan but you believe iran was behind it mike pompeo i i we have confidence that iran instigated this attack i i can t share any more of the intelligence but i wouldn t have said it if the intelligence community hadn t become convinced that this was the case margaret brennan so there s more that you can t share with us to back that up mike pompeo yes yes ma am that s correct margaret brennan iran state media says that they are going to start looking at ramping up their production of nuclear fuel what does the u s do to stop this if you ve already withdrawn from the nuclear accord mike pompeo think about that iran is now announcing that in a matter of days they can begin to spin up their nuclear program this tells you how flawed the deal was right it tells you that the deal had no capacity to actually stop them margaret brennan but what do you do now do you just keep putting more sanctions on desperation doesn t always lead to the best decision making mike pompeo our our intention is this we we know that their nuclear program accelerates if they have more money and wealth if they have more capacity more resources they have access to metals and to materials and to fissile material if we relieve sanctions their nuclear program presents an even greater risk to the united states and so our mission has been very clear deny them the wealth and resources and their capacity to build out a nuclear program and be prepared to do all that it takes to prevent that from happening margaret brennan i want to ask you quickly about russia the new york times is reporting that the u s is escalating digital attacks cyber attacks inside of russia to hit back an attempted interference in 2018 the president has called this report both false and treasonous which then suggests that there is some truth to it so which is it mike pompeo i never comment on intelligence matters margaret brennan the president said it was mike pompeo i i never i never comment on intelligence matters having having come from being cia director i know how important it is but you should know and your viewers should know that the united states of america under president trump has taken enormous effort to ensure that our elections are not interfered with not from russia not from any other country in the world it s a serious matter it s one that this administration took seriously at the direction of president trump from the very beginning of his time in office and we ll continue to do that i only wish the previous administration had been so serious about preventing election interference margaret brennan it s interesting that we are sharpening this point because it s the same week when we heard from the president as you know who told an interviewer on abc earlier this week that he would first listen to a foreign government if they tried to offer him dirt on an opponent and then make a decision as to whether or not to inform the fbi as the former cia director someone who talks every day to foreign governments what would you advise the president to do mike pompeo president trump clarified his remarks i think it s pretty clear he ll do the right thing i m highly confident of that i i don t have anything else to add margaret brennan which is mike pompeo i i saw his remarks he said he said i think in both instances he said he d he d do both he said he d report this to the fbi look it it it it s you all present this as margaret brennan but he presented no he presented he used the word maybe mike pompeo yeah margaret brennan and that it was he d listened first mike pompeo i listen i listen to this very closely the president made very clear he s going to do the right thing i have enormous confidence in that i ve watched him do it margaret brennan call the fbi mike pompeo i ve watched him do the right thing every time we ve had an important national security decision to be made he s evaluated options and made very good choices about how to proceed margaret brennan mister secretary thank you for time mike pompeo margaret thank you margaret brennan we turn now to arkansas republican senator tom cotton in addition to serving on the intelligence and armed services committees he has also written a new book called sacred duty a soldier s tour at arlington national cemetery good morning and happy father s day senator senator tom cotton r arkansas sentomcotton good morning margaret thanks for having me on margaret brennan you have long been defined as a hawk on iran you see these recent attacks these are commercial vessels not military installations what kind of response is warranted senator tom cotton well iran for forty years has engaged in this kind of attacks going back to the 1980s in fact ronald reagan had to reflag a lot of vessels going through the persian gulf and ultimately take military action against iran in 1988 these unprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant a retaliatory military strike margaret brennan are you you re comparing the tanker war in the eighties to now and saying that that s the kind of military response you want to see senator tom cotton we can make a military wreck response in a time and in a manner of our choosing but yes unprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant a retaliatory military strike against the islamic republic of iran margaret brennan a retaliatory strike when we had secretary pompeo on just a few moments ago he said the u s always has the authorization to defend american interests as someone who sits in congress do you believe that he can act the administration can act without coming to congress first senator tom cotton yes margaret going back to president washington and all the way down to president trump the fastest way to get the fire and fury of the u s military unleashed on you is to interfere with the freedom of navigation on the open seas and in the air that s exactly what iran is doing in one of the world s most important strategic chokepoints the president has the authorization to act to defend american interests certainly he it would be in keeping with what president obama did unwisely in libya in 2011 in launching a week s long campaign to overthrow the government there what i m talking about is not like what we ve seen in iraq for the last sixteen years or afghanistan for the last eighteen years but retaliatory military strikes against iran that make it clear we will not tolerate any kind of attacks on commercial shipping on the open seas margaret brennan so you believe that the existing authorization for military force is sufficient you ve also said though and as someone who s served in iraq you have an appreciation for the need to be careful in parsing intelligence and in first reports how do you convince the american people that they need to stomach something in terms of a potential strike that you re describing as somewhat easy to carry out when there were such vast underestimations of what u s force would bring about in iraq and elsewhere in the past senator tom cotton margaret those are two very different things in 2002 our intelligence agencies just like every western intelligence agency was trying to assess the state of a weapons of mass destruction program one of the things that states worked the hardest to keep secret there s really not much to assess right here everybody can see with their own two eyes those iranian sailors going up to a ship and taking a mine off of it iranian sailors ultimately boarded and height and took hostage the crew of one of those ships that they just released yesterday they tried to shoot down one of our surveillance aircrafts over the persian gulf as we were simply trying to monitor what had happened there as you heard secretary pompeo have said they ve increased their support on attacks on american troops by supporting a taliban attack in afghanistan margaret brennan mm hm senator tom cotton just like they killed five hundred americans in the iraq war so there s no doubt here what iran is up to they are struggling under the sanctions that we have placed on them the status quo for them is unacceptable they re hoping that they can drive up the price of oil and therefore benefit from it since their oil exports have declined so much and also get more pressure put on the united states to back off our campaign of maximum pressure that s not going to happen if anything we need to increase that pressure and i think this unprovoked attack on commercial shipping warrants retaliatory military strikes margaret brennan okay so that s a step farther than what the secretary said the president was currently willing to stomach i want to ask you as well about what the president said this week he said he would listen as you heard in that abc interview to foreign countries who might have dirt on his opponents before deciding whether or not to report it to the fbi doesn t this underest undermine all of the efforts to make our elections secure when you have the president of the united states say something like that senator tom cotton no no margaret he said as well not just on abc but especially on fox fox and friends later in the week that he would in fact report those kind of contacts to the fbi that s a very different thing too than what happened in 2016 margaret brennan right but that s why it s relevant now and senator tom cotton so margaret brennan what we re talking about now in terms of negative signals senator tom cotton and the president margaret brennan being sent senator tom cotton the president said that he would report that to the fbi and remember that s just simply receiving information in a hypothetical what happened in 2016 is hillary clinton hired a foreign spy margaret brennan what if senator tom cotton who then recruited let me finish who then recruited russian spies to fabricate lies about her political opponents that was then used margaret brennan so you re okay with what the president said senator tom cotton that was then used to generate a law enforcement investigation into the administration s political opponents margaret brennan so you re okay with what the president said senator tom cotton the president said that he would report those kind of contacts to the margaret brennan he said maybe senator tom cotton fbi margaret brennan he said maybe which i m asking you i ask you the same question senator tom cotton the president said he would as as margaret brennan would you say maybe as your answer senator tom cotton as anyone should and what people should not do is what hillary clinton and the democrats did which is hire a foreign spy to recruit russian spies to fabricate lies about their political opponents margaret brennan is tom cotton s answer to the question maybe when it comes to offering you and your campaign dirt senator tom cotton i would report those kind of contacts to the fbi margaret brennan no maybe thank you very much senator senator tom cotton thank you margaret brennan we will be back in one minute with congressman adam schiff announcements margaret brennan we are back now with california congressman adam schiff the chairman of the house intelligence committee happy father s day to you too chairman representative adam schiff d california repadamschiff intelligence committee chairman thank you margaret brennan good to have you here you heard tom cotton the senator and before that the secretary of state lay out this case against iran you because you re on the intelligence committee have been tracking the intelligence as well is there any question in your mind that it is iran and its revolutionary guard that is behind these attacks representative adam schiff there s no question that iran is behind the attacks i think the evidence is very strong and compelling in in fact i think this was a class a screw up by iran to insert a mine on the ship it didn t detonate they had to go back and retrieve it i can imagine there are some iranian heads rolling for that botched operation but nonetheless the problem is that we are struggling even in the midst of this solid evidence to persuade our allies to join us in any kind of a response and it shows just how isolated the united states has become our allies warned the united states i think our intelligence agencies warned policymakers that this kind of iranian reaction was likely a result of a policy of withdrawing from the iran nuclear agreement and so what we see is a split of the u s from our allies and we see russia and china coming together and having iran s back this is i think the worst of all situations and the maximalist pressure campaign has massively failed and only heightened the risk of conflict for my colleague senator cotton to advocate that we attack iran and provoke a war that there s no congressional authorization necessary i think is exactly the wrong answer on on both levels congressional approval is necessary to initiate hostilities against iran we should be trying to corral a response though from the international community to protect shipping to impose sanctions but because we have so alienated ourselves from our allies that s not happening margaret brennan do you see the risk of of this getting out of control and escalating further i mean you hear very clearly from the secretary of state the president is not seeking war senator cotton is laying out a very different pathway representative adam schiff i think that s true certainly the president has said that he doesn t want war but nonetheless his people and i don t know if this is pompeo or bolton or both seem to be taking actions to undercut that ambitions to stay out of warfare at a time when the president sent a message apparently through the japanese prime minister of an interest in going back to the table to negotiate bolton was announcing new sanctions on iran now is that an effort to scuttle the president s effort to initiate a dialogue it certainly seemed to have that effect but i think the the whole idea that somehow through this pressure campaign we were going to force iran to capitulate and say okay we ll come back to the table we ll give up everything was naive dangerously naive in the first place and this is what our allies are reacting to this was eminently foreseeable these attacks on shipping were eminently foreseeable and the fact that our reneging on the deal hasn t made us safer is part of the proof and i and i think for the secretary to tell you this morning that see the flaws in the nuclear deal iran can go back to enriching now we left the nuclear deal how is that to make the case that the nuclear deal was flawed we left the deal and now we re going to complain that iran is leaving as well margaret brennan i want to switch gears to talk a little bit about russia there was this new york times report that i m sure you saw that the u s is stepping up cyber i guess offensive actions to shut down potentially russian infrastructure if needed part of it is retaliation for attempts to interfere in elections including 2018 and now is the national security community responding in a stronger way to russian interference than what we hear from president trump himself representative adam schiff certainly i think the intelligence community is training its focus and resources on the russian threat even if the president isn t i can t comment on whether the new york times report is accurate or inaccurate but certainly we we ve had a heightened focus on russian meddling in our elections there have been persistent concerns about russia and other nations preparing the battlefield in terms of our energy grid and establishing a deterrent i think is very important but that effort to establish a determined deterrent is dramatically undercut when the president a month ago told putin over the phone that he still thinks the russian interference in our election was a hoax when the president says that he still is open to receiving foreign help and he may or may not call the fbi what i found most disturbing about that new york times story about whether we re preparing the battlefield in terms of the electrical grid in russia was the fact that the security officials with the administration felt they couldn t tell this to the president because he might compromise that information in a conversation with the russians or he might countermand their orders their military decisions because of the president s obsequious attitude towards russia margaret brennan is congress getting briefed on that is there enough congressional oversight of this kind of program representative adam schiff we are certainly and and again i can t confirm whether the program that is described in the new york times is either accurate or inaccurate but we certainly press the intelligence community and our military to be briefed kept currently informed and i think we are are being kept informed but but it s a continual effort margaret brennan you said recently that you may subpoena the fbi director chris wray to ask him questions about the original counterintelligence investigation into the trump campaign as it relates to 2016 why is that necessary are you still suggesting that the president may be a russian asset representative adam schiff what i m suggesting is that the counterintelligence investigation that began when the fbi had concerns that people around the president and ultimately the president might be acting as witting or unwitting agents of a foreign power we have not been able to get a briefing on since the day james comey was fired now we are still now we are just starting to get some information from the fbi i think the threat to subpoena the director has had some impact but we still don t know just who did the fbi have concerns about margaret brennan mm hm representative adam schiff what findings did they make the special counsel does refer in his report to fbi agents who were abetted and margaret brennan right representative adam schiff sent some findings back to headquarters we need to see those findings margaret brennan congressman thank you very much and we ll be back in just a moment announcements margaret brennan next week we will talk to democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders out on the campaign trail in columbia south carolina announcements margaret brennan we will be right back with a lot more face the nation including an interview with south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg stay with us announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg is one of the twenty four democrats running for president he s thirty seven years old and if he wins he will be the youngest president ever he would also be the first openly gay president we caught up with him on the campaign trail in virginia begin vt margaret brennan margaret brennan you faulted democrats in a speech this week for kind of not having much of a strategic foreign policy for the past few decades pete buttigieg mayor of south bend indiana petebuttigieg 2020 democratic presidential candidate i think margaret brennan what do you mean by that pete buttigieg i think that it s been difficult even confusing to figure out what our foreign policy is because democrats became so absorbed in opposing whatever the republicans were doing now often rightly so what the republicans were doing was often terrible but we got so sucked into that for example take the iraq war which i opposed as a student and continue to think was a terrible idea we were so horrified by the way that democracy promotion was done at gunpoint then that it very nearly made our party into isolationists when actually we ve often been the ones who believed in more international engagement and so margaret brennan so you would fault joe biden who you ll be standing on the debate stage with for his vote pete buttigieg well i certainly think that vote was a mistake and and i have a different view on that that conflict but it s more than any individual voter any individual conflict it s what worldview is going to anchor our approach we re not going to be able to figure out who we are as democrats by keying off the republicans and just deciding when we re against it and when we re going to accommodate it we have to have our own view and i think our own view needs to be based on the idea that american interests american values and american relationships all need to fit together and it s very clear that the u s is adrift i would argue under this administration the u s does not have a foreign policy maybe an approach but the approach is not pretty it involves coddling dictators it involves blaming fellow americans for a lot of the problems we have around the world and it s no substitute for a policy in which the u s is leading we can either lead the rest of the world or we can resent the rest of the world we can t do both margaret brennan president trump said if a foreign government offered him information on his opponent he d listen he said it s just like opposition research what do you think of that answer pete buttigieg we re talking about foreign interference in american politics and by the way this isn t hypothetical this isn t theoretical we were attacked by a hostile foreign power that decided that they could damage america destabilize america by intervening in the election to help him win and they did and he did and now america s destabilized if you believe in putting this country first how could you ever talk about allowing a foreign potentially hostile foreign power to interfere in the most sacred thing that we have in our civic tradition in america which is our elections margaret brennan he said he d listen before he d considered reporting it pete buttigieg just call margaret brennan is there a scenario in which that s acceptable pete buttigieg no just call the fbi it s not hard it s not complicated margaret brennan when you ve been asked about the president and the mueller report you said that if you are elected that you would consider pursuing obstruction of justice charges pete buttigieg it s not up to the president to pursue charges this is the thing margaret brennan but his justice department pete buttigieg so i absolutely i absolutely believe that there are plenty of reasons to to think that there may have been illegal behavior and margaret brennan mm hm pete buttigieg prosecutors should look at that and no one is above the law not a president not a former president no one i also believe that the last place you look for guidance on how to conduct a prosecution is to the oval office the less our law enforcement and prosecution has to do with politics the better and i margaret brennan so when some of your competitors say that there should be obstruction of justice charges pursued you re saying you re not endorsing that pete buttigieg there should be a department of justice that can think for itself there is tons of evidence that would point to an obstruction investigation i m just saying it shouldn t be ordered up by the president margaret brennan you look at a buttigieg justice department potentially prosecuting the president former president would you ever consider a pardon pete buttigieg i don t think that it s appropriate for pardon power to be used to cover for malfeasance or corruption in office right now margaret brennan so ford s pardoning of nixon pete buttigieg you know i don t know margaret brennan inappropriate pete buttigieg what i would have done in the 70s and and and that historical counterfactual other than that i m bothered by the possibility that public corruption went unpunished and the idea that that could happen in the future is equally problematic margaret brennan do you believe the trump administration when it says that those attacks on tankers that happened this week were conducted by iran pete buttigieg there is certainly a concern that this is consistent with a pattern of malignant behavior by iran what i m also concerned about is that this appears to be part of an escalation where this administration might be leading us on a path to war that could get away from this white house very quickly look it it is nothing new for iran to be acting in destabilized destabilizing ways in their region we see it quite a bit the question is what are we going to do to make things more stable before the situation becomes uncontrollable margaret brennan so what would you do pete buttigieg well first of all engage our allies we are not alone at least we shouldn t be acting alone and if we want to see stability in the middle east we should be engaging with our partners there as well as allies like our european partners who are such an important part of the iran nuclear deal and by the way another thing i would never have done margaret brennan mm hm pete buttigieg is to get us out of the nuclear deal setting off a chain reaction that has destabilized the regional security framework and the politics of that area and making it that much harder for any moderates that that are still in the iranian regime to get anywhere because they look foolish for having staked their careers on the idea that you could trust americans we need to have a completely different approach and when the same people who led us to the war in iraq like the national security adviser john bolton are now apparently guiding our policy toward iran in in the white house it makes you wonder whether we can really take this president at face value when he says he doesn t want us to go to war margaret brennan you also said you would rejoin that nuclear accord with iran but the u n watchdog the iaea has already said that iran is ramping up its production of nuclear fuel there are bans on arms that are going to expire right on the precipice of the election and shortly after you d be entering office so is that really a viable alternative pete buttigieg we re going to have to do something new the point is that we never should have left it in the first place margaret brennan so you want new negotiations and a new deal with iran pete buttigieg any negotiation is going to have to meet the needs and the realities of the moment unfortunately the moment we re in is one where the united states influence in this region has diminished because of the the way that we have withdrawn so what we re going to have to do is re engage with our partners re engage with anybody who has an interest in stability in the region and do whatever we can to once again meet the objective of stopping iran from developing nuclear capabilities which is exactly what that deal was doing even this administration certified that that was the case margaret brennan mister mayor thank you for your time pete buttigieg good to be with you end vt margaret brennan the full interview is on our website at facethenation com we will be right back with a look at where the 2020 field of democrats stand in the primary season announcements margaret brennan today we are unveiling our cbs news 2020 battleground tracker which we launched in 2016 in partnership with yougov the first part of the 2020 battleground tracker will focus on the democratic caucus and primary contest up to and including super tuesday we ll have polling specific to iowa new hampshire and south carolina along with aggregate polling from those states plus the other fifteen where contests will be held starting on february 3rd in iowa through march the 3rd which is super tuesday in that aggregate of eighteen early contest states former vice president joe biden is leading the field of candidates with thirty one percent of voters support senators elizabeth warren and bernie sanders are behind him with seventeen and sixteen percent respectively senator kamala harris rounds out our top tier at ten percent our next group has mayor pete buttigieg polling at eight percent former congressman beto o rourke at five and senators corey booker and amy klobuchar polling at two percent the rest of the field comes in with one percent of the vote or less joining us to tell us more about this first batch of polling as well as what we can look forward to this campaign season is cbs news elections and surveys director anthony salvanto anthony i know you live for this explain what s so different about the battleground tracker anthony salvanto cbs news elections and surveys director salvantocbs well it promises to be a big election so we ve got to go big with the polling and what that means is talking to more people than we ever have before more than you will see in most other polls it means being in the states that really matter the districts even that are going to matter and award delegates but mostly margaret it means putting this in terms that voters can relate to understanding how they think about this race and getting beyond the horse race so for example you mentioned as clear in all these early states joe biden is leading when we pollsters come along and ask who are you going to vote for in six months but it s early so what are voters doing they are considering some of these candidates when we ask them which candidates might you choose then we see a much closer contest we see warren under consideration certainly sanders harris and to a lesser extent buttigieg those are the folks that really define that top tier and those are the folks that voters are starting to narrow their choices already in this big field you also see differences in what voters want in a candidate in general margaret brennan mm hm and that s what i want to ask you what are voters looking for anthony salvanto well margaret brennan is there a divide among democrats anthony salvanto yeah in fact there is we asked people what should the parties message be should it be that the party would if they win return things to the way they were before president trump took office obviously democrats want to defeat president trump or should the party press for a more progressive or liberal agenda that it s ever had before and there s differences in vote choice based on how people divide on that the folks who go with more of that return message are much more for joe biden but the folks who say they want a more progressive agenda well there you ve got a mix not just biden but also warren and sanders really jockeying with him for the top spot margaret brennan and what makes someone electable anthony salvanto well that s the word that gets thrown around this town margaret brennan electability right anthony salvanto a lot right so what we did was we we turn people into political strategist a little bit and maybe they do a better job than a lot of the the folks in this town we asked them who do you think has the best chance to beat president trump and by and large they think that joe biden does have a very good chance the other candidates when voters tried to game out those chances placed the more at maybe they can win than a definitely win that s one of the big things that s propelling joe biden but then we went a little further and we said okay democrats tell us what you think swing voters are going to want come that general election in 2020 margaret brennan in other words not you but what do you think others are looking for anthony salvanto exactly so as they game that out democrats say they think those swing voters are the ones they got to try to lure back to the party might more might be more inclined to want a moderate and even a white male for those swing voters they think would be concerned about race and gender even as the democrats themselves of course have the most diverse primary field in history margaret brennan most diverse also most crowded that we have seen and that s one of those questions we often ask when we are talking to candidates is is that hurting you that this field is so full twenty four candidates so is it i mean why are there so many anthony salvanto well there are so many in part because i think the rules incentivize this which is to say this year the democrats have changed their rules so that party leaders and elected officials don t have as much say in the initial part of the contest as they used to they got rid of what they called super delegates that margaret brennan part of this is a response to 2016 anthony salvanto it s definitely a response to 2016 when a lot of democrats felt that those party leaders may have had their fingers on the scale for margaret brennan mm hm anthony salvanto hillary clinton over bernie sanders so this year you ve got much more power at least in that first run with voters and electing delegates to the convention that s one reason and the other is that with such a front loaded schedule a lot of big states are going to be holding their contests early margaret brennan mm hm anthony salvanto not just the ones you mentioned you know california texas et cetera that brings a very diverse electorate into the mix and so a lot of candidates feel like well they can pick up delegates in all of those different places maybe why not take a shot and that s one reason why you re going to see so many candidates on those stages come next week margaret brennan anthony i know we will be talking a lot to you in the coming months thank you anthony salvanto thanks margaret brennan we ll have more results from our 2020 battleground tracker ahead announcements margaret brennan it s time now for some political analysis amy walter is the national editor of the cook political report antjuan seawright is a democratic strategist and contributor on our digital network cbsn and leslie sanchez is a cbs news political contributor and also a familiar face on cbsn good to have you all here amy i want to start with you you heard anthony lay out the battleground tracker and some of the nuggets he picked up and it reminds me of the way you framed it revolution versus restoration amy walter cook political report amyewalter the takeaway right margaret brennan it seems among the democrats the fight to be had is on the revolution part of the ticket amy walter right and that s where the warren and the the sanders fight is right now they re taking about a third of the of the vote but we were talking right before the panel the person then we we wonder then who will biden ultimately have to fight with for that restoration and that s we haven t seen that quite yet even pete buttigieg i think is on the sort of warren and the sanders part of that again saying we need somebody different we need a we need a new way of thinking about things we don t need to go back to the old ways he says that a lot right margaret brennan mm hm amy walter let s not go back to the 90s we need to be looking to the future not such veiled swipe at a candidate who was very active in the 90s the person who really is i think a threat to then joe biden is somebody like kamala harris where you see that she doesn t pop up really very much in the polling her numbers overall are pretty low but when you ask people about their second choice her name comes up very high in that list i think she s at forty five percent in your poll which suggests that people don t necessarily are not thinking a whole lot about her they don t know a whole lot about her quite yet but they have her in the back of the mind of sort of a hmm if not joe biden maybe i ll take a look at her margaret brennan maybe we ll give her a shot but she is someone that in that interview with pete buttigieg he did also take a little bit of a gentle swipe antjuan we ll say in terms of trying to differentiate how he would respond to potentially prosecuting the existing president are we going to see these elbows get a little sharper next week on the debate stage or are we still going to have these just sort of veiled swipes antjuan seawright democratic strategist antjuansea well politics is a contact sport and so you just have to assume for people who want to separate themselves from their opponents they re going to do everything they can to margaret brennan they ve been pretty gentle so far antjuan seawright it s too early we re not even in preseason yet we re still in the training camp phase phase of this process it s too early of course they re going to be it is going to be a strong attempt to define their opponents but also to swipe at the frontrunner joe biden we ve seen some of that to this point i think it actually backfired i think it has made him stronger but to pete s point he is trying to climb the ladder of getting to the space that you re talking about where he is well positioned to be an alternative to joe biden but the candidate who has the ability to take a indistinct and keep on ticking will ultimately be the one that i think will be able to take on donald trump and to this point the polls indicate that person is joe biden margaret brennan mm hm and so when we see that debate stage it s not going to be ganging up on joe biden that s not going to be a successful strategy antjuan seawright i think i i will not do i do not think it will be i think that what the voters are hungry and thirsty for is what people are for laying out your own policy agenda we ve heard that time and time again and i think that if i was on that stage i would strictly talk about what i was for but i would speak to quality of life issues because i think that s where everyone is everybody wants to feel secured they want to feel like they their america is better than their parents and grandparents generation margaret brennan leslie there was a lot of attention this week to internal polling leslie sanchez cbs news political contributor lesliesanchez mm hm margaret brennan or other polling that might suggest president trump is more vulnerable particularly in the heartland than he would allow others to believe leslie sanchez sure margaret brennan where are these sort of soft spots for him leslie sanchez right i think it s a really fair question when you re talking about incumbency but i also would like to look at the historical context right we know for the most part people prefer to give president two terms unless there s something wildly different about it just historically you re going to do that what s different about trump is if we even compare i would told my democratic colleagues to obama at his point in his administration 2011 2012 they are within three or four points of each other in terms of approval rating he also had just had a big defeat in the midterms you know speaking of obama and same kind of you know bruised egos in that sense but by the time he got to election day there was a resounding defeat and that s part of what republicans are looking at the president his is mostly flat lined when it comes to approval rating but what i am not hearing talked about is style of leadership that s what republicans learned in the primary last go around it was not an issue mano a mano on policy it was this new approach a new more centrist approach that wasn t particularly republican it certainly wasn t conservative but it was breaking the polarization it s it s a bold polarization but it was breaking traditional washington and that s what s you re going to need in contrast to this president if any democrat is going to get leeway margaret brennan and is biden the biggest threat still to him i mean that s certainly from our polling what people s impression is that he is the best shot leslie sanchez i think for most part you could say that because he s going to appeal to a lot of that rust belt voter the the the working laborer a lot of areas that trump did well in that other republicans have not done particularly well in and not consistently but again i m going to go back to the economy if you look at the economic numbers in those states which is what we looked at in the midterms as well if it s over fifty percent then it s likely to swing toward republicans and that s what i m going to be watching margaret brennan but antjuan seawright but but i think leslie sanchez but plus antjuan seawright but but it s been pretty obvious that health care is the number one issue of the day for democrats and republicans and to your point here s an interesting thing about joe biden he is one of very few people running in our primary that could bring the many corners of our party together together and takeaway from the trump voter who voted for him in 16 who voted for barack obama in 2008 and if health care is the number one issue of the day margaret brennan mm hm antjuan seawright the republicans have failed the american people as it relates to access and affordability amy walter there is one really important thing though in that the pushback from the trump campaign on the polling they said well in our own polling when we gave voters a choice of a candidate who had these certain qualities then the numbers got much tighter this is called an informed ballot basically what they were saying is if you had a choice between donald trump and a socialist who would you vote for right that there s a reason that the term socialist is coming up a lot not just from the trump campaign but everywhere else margaret brennan you re teaming up perfectly here amy amy walter yes margaret brennan i want to play the sound bite here from senator bernie sanders bernie sanders wednesday i do understand that i and other progressives will face massive attacks from those who attempt to use the word socialism as a slur but i should also tell you that i have faced and overcome these attacks for decades and i am not the only one amy walter yeah well what the poll showed is that that s not working really well right now because when you ask democratic voters who they think is the most electable who s the who s a candidate who s best able to beat donald trump this is where joe biden wins in part because it s harder to attack him with those qualities so it s pretty clear what the trump campaign wants to do look they re not going to win because trump s numbers are going to increase leslie sanchez no amy walter obama s numbers as he ran through 2012 his approval ratings went up that s not what s going to happen here his numbers are going to probably stay the same trump s are but he has to make whoever the democrat is as unpopular as he is and if you look there s a new nbc wall street journal poll the candidates who they said who are you the most uncomfortable with trump s number one at fifty two percent sanders number two at forty one percent that s the danger leslie sanchez well in the historical part you had more people trump get more support in terms of the primaries than ever before he also had more people voting against him in the primary amy walter that s right leslie sanchez than ever before so it was the dichotomy of the two amy walter yeah leslie sanchez which again goes to that point of what were they looking for with trump if you look at the voters amy walter that s right leslie sanchez authen authenticity they were tired of this polished as people in the business you know who do a lot of the messaging and preparing candidates voters were tired amy walter yep leslie sanchez of the veneer around politicians they wanted somebody who was nontraditional in that sense who had conviction whether you like it or not and then and the funny part about about the president is he said they said oh he ll be more presidential when he gets into the white house you know oh yeah when i get there i m going to be more presidential and it s like wearing a pair of shoes that are too tight you know you may get down the hall but the second you can t you re going to take him off and that s what he s done and people have respected they may not like his style but they respect what he s done and now he gets legitimate credit for a booming economy that is a really difficult thing to move against as a candidate margaret brennan well we ve got to we ve got to leave it there unfortunately it s all the time we have amy walter right margaret brennan but we have what more than five days to go i m sure we ll be bringing you back to talk more antjuan seawright that s right
