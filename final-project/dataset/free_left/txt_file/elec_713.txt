 the president says the message of hope and change he campaigned on in 2008 still resonates in 2016 by nolan d mccaskill 12 26 2016 09 42 am est updated 12 26 2016 05 09 pm est president barack obama still believes in the message of hope and change he campaigned on in 2008 so much so that he believes it could have delivered him a third term over donald trump had the constitution allowed him to run again i am confident in this vision because i m confident that if i if i had run again and articulated it i think i could ve mobilized a majority of the american people to rally behind it obama told his former senior adviser david axelrod on monday s axe files podcast i know that in conversations that i ve had with people around the country even some people who disagreed with me they would say the vision the direction that you point towards is the right one advertisement obama campaigned vigorously for hillary clinton his former secretary of state dispatching himself vice president joe biden and first lady michelle obama across the country on clinton s behalf it would be a personal insult to his legacy he said during the campaign if the black community didn t support clinton all of his administration s accomplishments would be reversed under a president trump he warned progress and hope he argued were on the ballot although his name was not but it was all for naught republicans successfully painted clinton as a corrupt dishonest politician who was running for obama s third term despite they insisted putting america s national security at risk when she set up a private email server as head of the state department she belonged in jail some said others accused her of using her family nonprofit as a slush fund and argued that the longtime politician was the quintessential emblem of the status quo not the change agent she portrayed herself to be by nolan d mccaskill and trump who vanquished a crowded field of 16 additional republicans including current and former senators and governors before toppling clinton is skeptical that anyone could have bested him including an incumbent president president obama said that he thinks he would have won against me trump tweeted monday afternoon he should say that but i say no way jobs leaving isis ocare etc trump railed against obama and clinton s policies on the campaign trail he ran on the promise of repealing and replacing obamacare dubbed obama and clinton the founders of the islamic state and slammed them for having supported free trade policies like the trans pacific partnership and nafta clinton prevailed in the popular vote winning nearly 3 million more ballots across the country than trump but it was trump s improbable campaign that won the requisite number of electoral college votes to be elected president and he maintains he could have won the popular vote too had that been his aim by obama s assessment clinton performed wonderfully under really tough circumstances but there were problems obama accused the media of wildly amplifying clinton s flaws because of a double standard and said democrats weren t on the ground where they needed to be to show people in rural communities that the democratic party cares about them too there s an emotional connection and part of what we have to do to rebuild is to be there and that means organizing that means caring about state parties it means caring about local races state boards or school boards and city councils and state legislative races and not thinking that somehow just a great set of progressive policies that we present to the new york times editorial board will win the day obama told axelrod now with trump weeks away from being sworn in as the next president the theme of hope that carried the obamas into the white house in 2008 has emerged as the concept they re tightly grasping onto as they transition out eight years later see now we re feeling what not having hope feels like michelle obama told oprah winfrey in her own exit interview broadcast last week the first lady cast hope as a necessary concept that wasn t just a nice slogan for votes but something she and her husband believe in for his part trump told supporters at a thank you rally in mobile alabama that they have tremendous hope and suggested the first lady made that statement not meaning it the way it came out it is trump after all who appears to represent the change americans want today eschewing political correctness and largely self funding his primary campaign trump was undeniably a shift from the status quo voters hoped he would come to washington shake things up and drain the swamp as he said on the trail in monday s podcast obama credited senate majority leader mitch mcconnell for republicans obstruction throughout his entire administration an effort he argued that was meant to obscure the hope and change he campaigned on by rejecting his policies outright and creating stagnation presidential transition by andrew restuccia and nancy cook according to obama mcconnell s view was that if we just say no then that will puncture the balloon and all this talk about hope and change and no red state and blue state is proven to be a mirage a fantasy and if we can if we can puncture that vision then we have a chance to win back seats in the house and win back seats in the senate obama continued relaying his understanding of mcconnell s message that strategy worked republicans retook the house after the 2010 midterms and reclaimed the senate in 2014 majorities they retained following the nov 8 election obama said he understood what happened politically but insists his message from 2008 still resonates obviously in the wake of the election and trump winning a lot of people have suggested that somehow it really was a fantasy he said referring to the message of hope and change what i would argue is is that the culture actually did shift that the majority does buy into the notion of a one america that is tolerant and diverse and open and full of energy and dynamism and the problem is it doesn t always manifest itself in politics right missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the
