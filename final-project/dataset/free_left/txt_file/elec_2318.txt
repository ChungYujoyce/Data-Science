advertisement supported by by steve eder and pam belluck as a surgeon for three decades ben carson carefully balanced his responsibilities as a physician with his deeply religious personal philosophy and as a presidential candidate he has offered views on a variety of issues including vaccines climate change and creationism that have endeared him to some conservative voters but perplexed some of his science minded former colleagues for example during a recent republican debate he backed the view of the medical community that autism was not caused by vaccines but he raised eyebrows by suggesting that they should be spread out in a recent interview with the new york times dr carson elaborated on his views on a number of scientific religious and medical topics some people feel that i make the declaration and everybody has to march to my drum my point was that there are a lot of people who are so concerned about the load of vaccines that they are getting in a very short period of time that they may abandon the use of vaccines altogether which would be a very significant public health issue for us i think we have to be willing to talk with them and to look at alterations in schedule when you look at how many times the schedule has been altered by so called experts it tells you right there that whatever schedule they come up with is not necessarily the perfect schedule take into consideration the concerns of these people and let s work with them so that we can get people on the same page rather than declaring i m the great oz no one else could possibly know anything there are some diseases where i think there is room for discussion chickenpox now chickenpox is generally not a fatal disease by any stretch of the imagination in fact when i was a kid they used to have chickenpox parties somebody would get it and they d bring everybody over so they would get it too and then everybody would be immune to it the question for the antivaxers is do the vaccinations create more problems than they solve you are never going to convince them unless you are willing to sit down with the data and unless you are actually willing to listen to them and listen to their concerns that s been the problem i generally am very pro vaccines and pro vaccinations i think they ve saved a lot of lives and cut down on a lot of morbidity in our society i think the problem we are having now is we have an increasing number of antivaxers i think they are being reactionary and i think they are being reactionary because of the way things are being imposed upon them it is a microcosm of the bigger problems that we are having in our country right now where people try to impose things on everybody rather than sitting down and having an intelligent conversation and looking at the data looking at the evidence i recognize that people love to see carnage and that s why boxing and wrestling and things like football are so popular that s not going to go away what we need to do is try to do it in the safest way possible primarily my wife just didn t like the idea of them possibly getting hurt my oldest son wanted to go out for wrestling in fact he was very kindhearted in fact he would feel sorry for the opponent and let them win considering the number of cases i did and how complex they were the number is really quite small i would like to see more physicians scientists engineers serving in public office because they are taught to make decisions based on evidence as opposed to on ideology and we have so many ideologues now and it makes it very difficult to get things done because an ideologue will just assume that their belief is correct i am a person who has a very deep and abiding faith in god and a deep relationship and i believe that he is the source of all wisdom that is why i always prayed for wisdom and he gave it to me you know i had a number of parents same sex parents who came in and we gave their children exactly the same care that we gave everybody else s kid certainly they have right to do whatever they want to do but i don t necessarily agree that that s the best way to bring up a child i believe the bible i do believe it is the word of god i do believe he created heavens and earth it says in genesis 1 in the beginning god created heaven and earth period we don t know how long that period is before he started the rest of creation it could be a minute it could be a trillion years we don t know i have never stated that i have an understanding of how old the earth is that s something that a lot of people will ascribe to me organisms animals have the ability to adapt to their environment but the evolutionists say that s proof positive that evolution occurs i say it is evidence of an intelligent god who gave his creatures the ability to adapt to its environment so he wouldn t have to start over every 50 years i finally just said lord if you really want me to do this you ll have to open the doors because all of the professionals say that it is impossible for someone like me but if you open the doors i ll walk through them and the doors have been opened and i m walking through them if they close i ll sit
