advertisement supported by secretary of state mike pompeo backed president trump s assertion that the coronavirus originated in a lab in wuhan though intelligence agencies say they have reached no conclusion on the issue by david e sanger washington secretary of state mike pompeo on sunday backed president trump s assertion that the coronavirus originated in a research laboratory in wuhan china though the nation s intelligence agencies say they have reached no conclusion on the issue speaking on the abc program this week mr pompeo the former c i a chief and one of the senior administration officials who is most hawkish on dealing with china said that there s enormous evidence that the coronavirus came from the lab though he agreed with the intelligence assessment that there was no indication that the virus was man made or genetically modified the theories are not mutually exclusive some officials who have examined the intelligence reports which remain classified say it is possible an animal that was infected with the coronavirus in the laboratory was destroyed and a lab worker was accidentally infected in the process but that is just one of many theories still being examined senior american officials including those who have looked at intelligence and who favor the lab theory have said in private that evidence pointing to a lab accident is mainly circumstantial and based on public material intelligence officers have told senior administration officials that they probably will not find proof of a lab accident and among scientists and especially virologists there is largely agreement that the chances that a lab accident sparked the outbreak are slim while the probability that the new virus made the leap from an animal to a human in a nonlab setting in southern china is much higher mr pompeo repeatedly accused china s communist party led by president xi jinping of covering up evidence and denying american experts access to the research lab the wuhan institute of virology we ve seen the fact that they kicked the journalists out mr pompeo said referring to orders that american correspondents from the new york times the washington post and the wall street journal leave china we saw the fact that those who were trying to report on this medical professionals inside of china were silenced they shut down reporting all the kind of things that authoritarian regimes do the way communist parties operate mr pompeo is among the small group of senior officials believed to be pushing american spy agencies to find evidence to support the theory that the government laboratory in wuhan was the origin of the outbreak the chinese government has vigorously denied that the virus leaked from the laboratory and at one point suggested that the american military created it the office of the director of national intelligence issued a statement on thursday saying it was continuing to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began with infected animals or whether it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in wuhan the same day mr trump said he had a high degree of confidence that the laboratory was the source of the outbreak but when pressed for evidence said i m not allowed to tell you that in a sunday night interview on fox news he promised a report on the subject which he said would be conclusive i think they made a horrible mistake and they didn t want to admit it he said of china some intelligence analysts are concerned that the pressure from administration officials could distort the final assessments about the virus s origin and that they could be used as a political weapon in an intensifying battle with china over a disease that has infected more than three million people across the globe if the administration continues on the path that mr pompeo and mr trump have blazed in recent days they will doubtless come under increasing pressure to make available some of the evidence that led them to their conclusions but that could prove tricky as it did for the bush administration when after the invasion of iraq it was under pressure to make public the assessments it received that saddam hussein was building weapons of mass destruction that evidence turned out to be flawed and some of the government agencies with the most expertise on the issue wrote dissents that were ignored or overruled in the case of the coronavirus declassifying the evidence about the wuhan laboratory is more complex some evidence appears to be based on electronic intercepts of communications among chinese officials and revealing those could well expose details of how the united states keeps track of chinese leadership as a result mr trump and mr pompeo are likely to fall back on the usual explanation that they cannot risk revealing sources and methods of intelligence collection some american officials say even intercepts of chinese officials in beijing discussing questions surrounding the lab could be circumstantial since central level officials always suspect local officials of hiding information and so want to examine all possibilities as they investigate and american officials say they had little in the way of intelligence collection focused on wuhan officials before the outbreak they would also have to explain doubts within the government about the intelligence which is not unusual in the case of a complex problem like decoding the origins of a virus an april 7 meeting convened by richard grenell the acting director of national intelligence failed to gain a consensus among intelligence officials about how the outbreak occurred suggesting that any evidence that gets released may not be conclusive and some american allies also seem skeptical of the wuhan laboratory theory at the same time mr pompeo was correct in his assertions that chinese government officials went to considerable lengths to cover up evidence about the outbreak and detained scientists who warned about it they closed a laboratory in shanghai after one of its lead scientists shared the genomic sequence of the virus with collaborators around the world that data has been critical to medical research including on possible vaccines but the chinese authorities said the laboratory had to be closed down for rectification transcript in the world of intelligence there s this old adage that there are secrets and mysteries secrets are something that one government hides from another mysteries are things that your intelligence community can t answer for you the difference matters to an intelligence agency like the c i a because if something s a secret then it s information they can go out and find or steal but if something s a mystery there is no information to get and this adage has come up a lot in recent weeks it is really a crucial question as intelligence agencies are looking at where this coronavirus came from did it come from a lab in china and does the chinese government know it is that a secret that s being kept or is it a mystery that nobody knows from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily in the absence of a clear explanation for how the coronavirus started several theories have circulated today julian barnes on the chinese lab theory it s thursday may 7 julian tell me about this theory that i know has taken hold pretty much across the united states about the origins of this virus well it s kind of a vague theory when you hear people talk about it there s all kinds of different versions did it come from that infamous wuhan institute of virology and if so how will we find out there s versions of an animal slipping out of a lab in wuhan i know we ve been saying that perhaps the virus got out of that virology lab by accident was it really an accident or a worker having it on their clothing and taking it out that because of lax safety protocols an intern was infected who later infected her boyfriend and then went to the wet market in wuhan where it began to spread there s a version that talks about infected animals being disposed improperly early research suggests humans picked up the coronavirus from animals possibly bats but it s not clear how the virus made that jump and all this has sort of swirled almost like gossip but all pointing to a lab in wuhan and you can understand why that theory gained traction because there is a level four lab studying coronaviruses the very strain of coronaviruses that unleash this global pandemic so that much is true there actually is a lab that studies the coronavirus in wuhan where this outbreak began yeah that s right it s not a bioweapon lab it s not for a nefarious purpose in fact it s for a public health purpose they study coronaviruses for the hopes of protecting people from them but the fact of the matter is there are deadly strains of coronavirus inside this lab so these theories that we re all talking about they made it to the white house they made it to the white house pretty early back in january back in january matthew pottinger who is the deputy national security advisor started asking questions about where this came from was it accidentally created in a lab mm hm and what is the response to this question that this senior official is asking well about this time as the white house starts pushing for this information the c i a is concluding that china is not being honest about the numbers in wuhan province the death toll in china has risen to 56 people that s 15 more deaths in the past 36 hours they started briefing the white house that china is misstating understating the numbers nearly 2 000 people are infected and why is that important i was speaking to a european intelligence official who said you know when the numbers first came out of wuhan they were making estimates of how dangerous this disease was based on that but then in february covered head to toe in protective gear doctors work around the clock and compare the situation to a war zone your health system no matter how good how efficient how modern it is sooner or later will collapse because the number of patients is too high for the resources we have the virus hits italy and the mortality numbers there were way worse than what was reported in wuhan and italy has the highest mortality rate anywhere in the world with 3 000 and it started to look to some people like the chinese government was trying to keep a secret so if that is the case what else has china been lying about that s the question right and if china has lied about mortality rates in wuhan then they could be lying about everything right in the minds of intelligence officials if china is lying about their numbers lying about their mortality statistics they could also be lying about the origin of the virus the origin of the pandemic they could be lying about the lab about what they know about the lab so this idea that china is not sharing all that it knows that china may be misleading convinces policymakers in the white house that there are secrets out there and people like pottinger who have been predisposed to distrust china it gives them ammunition to argue throughout the government that this is worse than you think china is at fault and then president donald trump announces richard grenell will become acting director of national intelligence grenell will be in charge of the nation s 17 spy agencies the intelligence agencies get a new director of national intelligence a former spokesman turned fox news talking head turned ambassador with very little actually no intelligence experience now rick grenell is an interesting figure he does not come from the world of intelligence rick grenell is a partisan defender of the president he is one of the most effective people at pushing the president s agenda he is the ambassador to germany so he deals with intelligence he receives intelligence but he s never been a collector of intelligence but he does know what the president wants he does know what the president is interested in and he sort of has an intuitive understanding that the origin of this outbreak is going to be a piece of information that s very important to donald trump so what happens with rick grenell in this role well what happens next is there s some intelligence that comes in on march 30 some new intelligence that chinese officials have discussed the possibility that the virus came from the lab wow yeah so this piece of intelligence changes some minds of the people who have seen it some people who were skeptical of the lab theory start to see it as a real possibility the president is really intrigued grenell convenes a review he brings together the various intelligence agencies to discuss what they know they actually conclude that they can t make a conclusion they don t know where it came from there are open source science articles there are questions about the safety of the lab there is this very idea that we were talking about about the coincidence but there s no smoking gun all the intelligence agencies agree there s just not one hard piece of evidence that says there this shows that it came from a lab hm julian you just said that the fact that china is looking into this same question that american intelligence officials are seemed to add credibility to the american theory but as i m thinking about it it occurs to me doesn t that suggest that the origin story here is a mystery perhaps rather than a secret and what i mean by that is if the chinese government is looking into this question wouldn t that mean that they don t know the answer and that they re not trying to cover it up they re just trying to figure it out for themselves that s right and that s how some people in the intelligence world look at it they say you know china is struggling for this answer too this answer is not out there others who are more skeptical believe that china is covering it up from its own people and that the number of people who would know about this is very small and china is very good at keeping its secrets you can have a situation where the central government doesn t know something but officials at a lower level do know the answer but they re afraid to tell it they could put their own lives in danger to spread a piece of bad information so finding something out in a country with an authoritarian system like that makes it much more difficult because it might not be a dichotomy it might be both a secret and a mystery that s right it might be a secret and a mystery we ll be right back so at this point in our story julian what is the state of this theory well this theory starts to really be picked up by conservative media i have been asked by a tremendous number of people if i believe that the chi com government did this on purpose rush limbaugh is talking about the wuhan lab now we ve basically confirmed this the belief is that the virus escaped from that high security virology lab it is frequently discussed on fox news joining me right now is senator tom cotton himself he sits on the senate armed services committee senator tom cotton has made multiple appearances to sort of ask questions so we don t know where it originated but we do know that just a few miles away from that food market is china s only biosafety level four super laboratory that researches human infectious diseases and there s this increasing focus on the right about the lab theory as part of an effort to hold china responsible for more let s bring in the secretary of state mike pompeo good morning mr secretary and into this comes mike pompeo he begins to really run with the lab theory and mr secretary have you seen anything that gives you high confidence that it originated in that wuhan lab in one interview pompeo says there s significant evidence to support the theory there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in wuhan to convince people that the lab theory is the leading theory the foremost theory i think the whole world is united understanding that china brought this virus to the world thanks very much for joining us mr secretary we appreciate your time thank you martha and is pompeo right i mean is he seeing something that you haven t because from everything you ve said so far there is not significant intelligence that this originated in a lab in china no there isn t significant evidence the intelligence agencies haven t been able to say that the lab theory takes precedence from whether the virus was naturally created outside a lab just by a natural transmission between an animal and a human and in fact scientists are pretty skeptical that this came from the wuhan lab they believe there had to be an intermediate step from the bat viruses that were studied in the lab to another animal and so the growing body of scientific voices is pushing against what pompeo is saying right now and julian especially given the lack of evidence is there a risk to the united states going after china on this front accusing them of starting it in a lab oh absolutely i mean china controls a lot of the pharmaceutical supply chain they are the country that makes masks and protective gear picking a fight with china could cause them to slow the flow of that desperately needed equipment and there s also a race for a vaccine i mean china may get a vaccine for this coronavirus before the united states or europe does and what if beijing is so angry at the trump administration for its blaming of china that they withhold that vaccine there is absolutely a risk in this strategy well then so why would republicans and the conservative media want to pick this fight well remember where we are we are in april tens of thousands of people are dying the lockdown and public health measures have frozen everything and people are blaming trump and his best case for re election a strong economy has disappeared so it is a way to deflect the blame from washington and put it on china but why isn t it enough just to know it came from china why do they want to pin it to a lab in such a precise way because if it came from an accident in a lab then there was a misstep it s just not dumb luck somebody did something wrong and the chinese have something to account for and for president trump this is an important idea it would pin responsibility on china and this idea that his critics say his inaction made the situation worse in the united states well president trump could argue no what could i have done china unleashed this on the world through their negligence but it feels like there s one immovable obstacle to all of this and it s that the intelligence agencies which you cover they are not giving the president they re not giving the secretary of state any of the evidence that would be required to make this public case it s just not happening yeah that s right this would be a much easier case for president trump to make for secretary pompeo to make if the statement from the intelligence community was yes we see this evidence but that s not what they ve said they ve said they re looking into this they can t conclude what the leading theory is they cannot pin it on the lab but as long as the intelligence agencies say they are looking into this this idea is going to hold a lot of power in people s minds and it s going to be part of our civic and political discourse so do we know whether they re ever going to be able to answer the question intelligence officials say to answer your question they need access to that lab they would have to be able to look at the samples there they would have to be able to talk to the workers and without access to the lab that smoking gun is not something that they can get they can t get at the secret they say only once you get into that lab can you know was there a secret they were hiding or were they as blind as we were was it in fact a mystery julian thank you very much thank you on wednesday china fired back at the trump administration over its suggestion that the virus had originated in a lab there calling it quote blame shifting that should be ignored by the american public hours later secretary of state mike pompeo took questions from reporters about his role in promoting the theory you said in multiple interviews on may 1 april 30 and other days some version of we don t know if the virus came from inside the lab in wuhan and then on sunday you said there s enormous evidence the virus came from inside the lab those are both true listen i ve now answered this question i think it s the 13th time happy to try to answer it again i m not sure what it is that about the grammar that you can t get we don t have certainty about whether it began in the lab or whether it began someplace else there s an easy way to find out the answer to that transparency openness the kinds of things that nations do when they really want to be part of solving a global pandemic when they really want to participate we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today on wednesday president trump reversed course on his plan to shut down the coronavirus task force and said that instead it would continue on indefinitely i think it is a change a little bit i thought we could wind it down sooner during an appearance in the oval office the president acknowledged that he had changed his mind after receiving negative feedback to his original plan i had no idea how popular the task force is until actually yesterday when i started talking about winding it down i get calls from very respected people saying i think it would be better to keep it going it s done such a good job it s a respected task force and several states in brazil began lockdowns on wednesday after the death toll in that country reached a daily peak of 633 people brazil s president jair bolsonaro has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus compared it to a quote measly cold and attended a rally against lockdowns that s it for the daily i m michael barbaro see you tomorrow edward wong contributed reporting
