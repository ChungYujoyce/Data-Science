 2016 proven wrong about his campaign manager s treatment of a reporter trump used the incident to tighten his bond with his supporters by eli stokols and ben schreckinger 03 30 2016 05 21 am edt donald trump s critics saw a misogynist caught lying to defend another misogynist trump s supporters rallied for him even more fervently ap photo janesville wis the facts are no match for donald trump trump who is already viewed very unfavorably by half of the country s women refused to criticize or discipline his campaign manager after he was charged tuesday with battery for grabbing a female reporter advertisement rather trump defended him and blamed the reporter for causing the altercation which was captured by surveillance at trump s florida estate where it occurred earlier this month and then embellishing her story by accusing corey lewandowski of throwing her down did anybody see the tapes trump asked the 1 000 supporters crammed into a hotel ballroom here tuesday afternoon what did you think nothing several people shouted the video did show something it showed lewandowski who called breitbart news reporter michelle fields delusional for claiming he grabbed her doing just that it also cut the factual foundation out from under trump s campaign which repeatedly denied any wrongdoing on the night of march 8 when the incident occurred following a news conference at trump s resort in jupiter florida but in the hours between the tape s release and trump taking the stage here any chance of it separating trump from his fans vanished as the networks played the tape on loop the footage much like trump itself became a rorschach test with everyone seeing what they wanted to trump wrapped up the hourlong town hall by portraying lewandowski a former police officer as a sympathetic family man wrongly accused and later in yet another hour of national television afforded to him portrayed himself as a defender of the downtrodden who stood with his maligned staffer when others wouldn t at first i said oh this is terrible trump said and then i saw the tape she bolts into the picture she hits me on the arm and then he goes by and maybe he touched her a little bit trump continued it was almost like he was trying to keep her off me like he was trying to help her by eli stokols trump s critics saw a misogynist caught lying to defend another misogynist and the condemnations came from all corners trump s gop rivals ted cruz and john kasich both condemned lewandowski s behavior and trump s reaction to it democrats pounced and a host of groups waiting for trump should he reach a general election gave him a taste of what s in store and so the video that might in a different time have ended the controversy served only to heighten it and if past is prologue each new piece of information about lewandowski or all other things trump will only further that divide no longer simply between republicans and democrats but all for whom trump personifies their own idealized america and others who see him as an affront to the country s founding principles outside the holiday inn in the hours leading up to the rally tuesday afternoon hundreds of protesters mingled uneasily with several thousand trump supporters as they stood in a long snaking line and for those who were later unable to fit inside the venue as they stood outside and listened to trump s voice emanating from speakers at least nine police officers armed with binoculars cameras and rifles looked on from the building s rooftop along the road leading from the highway to the hotel the protesters gathered behind a large banner of white butcher paper with red stop signs that read stop trump many held up smaller signs a white poster with end racism stop trump scrawled in black pen a neon yellow sign reading great leaders unite not divide nearby more than a dozen vendors hawked paraphernalia from card tables including t shirts that read trump finally someone with balls and hillary sucks but not like monica on the back trump that b on the sidewalk in front of a fuddruckers as trump spoke some listened peggy sue metz 47 a trucking dispatcher from rockton illinois lamented not making it inside and being forced to share the sidewalk with the protesters who she suspected were raised with the values of unionized schoolteachers rather than those of their own parents it would be nice to go back to the days when the father worked and could support five kids and the mother could stay home and raise the kids properly she said other pro and anti trump people in the crowd traded insults argued about race and jockeyed to block one another s signs from view police removed several members of the crowd from the property and at least one young woman was maced inside pacing back and forth on a dais in front of a blue curtain draped with the american and wisconsin state flags trump declared that his campaign was not only a bid for the white house but also a profound social movement i m a messenger trump declared this is something that s so special and so amazing it s on the cover of time magazine it s a phenomenon whatever people see everyone is watching trump and the spectacle of it all continues to relegate his rivals to bit players in an ongoing reality television show of a campaign that continues to devolve hours after his janesville town hall trump took part in a cnn town hall in milwaukee where he distracted from the lewandowski controversy by stirring another rescinding his pledge to support the republican nominee for president we ll see who it is he said asserting that he had been treated unfairly by the republican national committee and the gop establishment many of whom are funding super pac efforts to attack him and plotting how to take the nomination away from him during the convention in cleveland 2016 by daniel lippman darren samuelsohn and isaac arnsdorf having dominated the country s airwaves and campaign coverage for nine months trump has managed to program his supporters to the point that they deliver his lines for him finishing his sentences about building a border wall and forcing mexico to pay for it responding to mentions of rivals like cruz by shouting out lyin ted the cutting moniker trump has successfully hung around yet another competitor s neck they even give voice to statements trump himself is unwilling to make explicit here tuesday in paul ryan s hometown trump steered clear of criticizing the speaker of the house himself because he figured out a way to have his audience do it for him how do you like paul ryan trump asked the crowd i was told to be nice to paul ryan boos rose up from the room paul rino someone shouted wow trump said i m very surprised at this statement he was not really that surprised nor was he truly at a loss when he feigned disbelief about why harley guys preferred him to their own motorcycle riding governor scott walker he comes in on his motorcycle but the motorcycle guys like trump trump said why do they like me tell me he continued assuming an answer was forthcoming from the crowd and it was because you don t take any shit a man in the front row called out loudly enough to be heard in the back of the room missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020
