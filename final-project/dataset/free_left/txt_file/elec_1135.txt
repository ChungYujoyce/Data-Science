advertisement supported by political memo by jason horowitz cedar falls iowa hillary rodham clinton was in a forgiving mood she had been discussing the small business economy at a round table gathering at a bike shop here on tuesday when the fox news correspondent ed henry interrupted when he shouted would she take questions from the news media she had ignored for weeks on end maybe when i finish talking to the people here mrs clinton said as she leaned over a 3 d printed mechanical part that looked like a post apocalyptic rubik s cube how s that you ll come over mr henry followed up i might mrs clinton said teasingly for the amusement of the 19 local residents invited to attend this latest installment of the movable clinton court and to the annoyance of the more than 50 members of the news media roped off around them she added i have to ponder it but i will put it on my list for due consideration unlike in 2008 when mrs clinton s regal bearing was brought low by barack obama s insurgent campaign there is no one to force her out of her rose garden neither bernie sanders the socialist senator from vermont nor martin o malley the former governor of maryland has applied significant pressure on her that leaves the news media as her only real opponent so far on the way to the democratic presidential nomination and while it may not be great for an educated populace or the furtherance of american democracy it makes all the political sense in the world for mrs clinton to ignore them too there is no shortage of reminders of the downsides of engagement she need only look at her republican counterparts starting with jeb bush who has made a point of opening up more to reporters but damaged himself during a several day struggle with how to answer a question about the wisdom of the war in iraq mrs clinton can expect little if any opposition in the democratic primaries but she was similarly well positioned when she declared her candidacy in 2007 senator marco rubio s difficulties with the same question were condensed to a few highly awkward and viral minutes gov scott walker of wisconsin has been working for weeks to overcome his flubbing of initial questions about foreign policy and senator rand paul s snappish interactions with female reporters have only fed the impression that he is thin skinned mrs clinton had her own rocky introduction to the 2016 press corps when she gave defensive and not entirely convincing answers at a news conference prompted by the revelation that she had used a private email server as secretary of state but as reporters have dug deeper into the emails the financial conduct of her family s foundation and the character of the company she keeps mrs clinton has only seemed more comfortable and dominant on the campaign trail she has rolled out more liberal positions on immigration reform and college debt and stayed mum on inconvenient things she does not want to talk about like a potential trade deal or israeli policies loathed by her liberal base and unlike in 2008 when the battle between her and mr obama forced mrs clinton to do events late into the night and she often slipped up or held forth about brain science she is keeping her campaign schedule to a bare minimum this week as she campaigned in iowa chicago and new hampshire where on friday she again took questions from reporters a relative flurry of activity she generally filled each day with one event open to the news media a smaller one with a pool reporter and then some unexpected stops where she ordered coffee or bought toys for her grandchild always the grandchild at the bike shop event on tuesday she listened intently to the stories of the round table participants nodding 43 times a minute as they talked about their ice cream shops and 3 d printing as television lights cast the shadows of two rows of everyday americans onto the tablecloth she looked expertly over the locals heads and into the television cameras behind them to give her prepared remarks i want to make the words middle class mean something again donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention she complimented the participants on their inquiries that s a very fair question or that s a very good question and when the moderator unexpectedly pushed her on her position on president obama s proposed trans pacific partnership she dodged artfully when it finally came time to ask their questions the reporters seemed more agitated than the candidate as they pushed against a rope line for the impromptu news conference and gasped when her traveling press secretary nick merrill joked wouldn t it be funny if she walked off hey y all ready mrs clinton asked as she sauntered over yeah said the chorus of reporters tell me tell me something i don t know she said almost musically as she snapped her head to the left in a janet jackson era dance move ha ha ha ha the smile on mrs clinton s face slowly faded as she nodded and replied and obfuscated in response to the half dozen questions asked of her she did so with ease despite the people shouting about her destroying her emails and calling out did you take official actions for the clinton foundation donors and then she turned away essentially dusting the whole dodging the press story line off her bird s eye blazer mrs clinton s relationship with the political press has never been warm she started the 2008 race straight arming reporters and only when the nomination began slipping from her grasp did she seek to embrace them it was too late when she boarded the press bus with bagels i didn t want you to feel deprived no one partook despite that chill though there was a sense of professionalism and familiarity on the clinton bus because many of the reporters represented new york based publications and had covered her as a senator news conferences were not frequent but they occurred behind curtains after events now both mrs clinton and the news media have changed she seems less a presidential candidate than a historical figure returning to claim what is rightfully hers and the press corps both blessed and cursed with live streaming tweeting and snapchatting technologies is armed with questions devised to win the moment the result is a carnival atmosphere it is not clear what mrs clinton gains politically from playing the freak the solution for her team has been to keep the press at bay as mrs clinton reads the scripts to her daily campaign shows the media was confined between the bar and the stove gary swenson said describing an event with mrs clinton at his home in mason city iowa on monday asked if he had learned anything from her talk he said no i don t think i learned anything remarkably new but added after a pause i think it was more her demeanor it astonished me i expected somebody who had space between herself and the people who lived here and there was none the press did not learn much either from mrs clinton s remarks in mason city or her answers at the impromptu bike store news conference except that she is an exceedingly strong candidate but that did not mean the event was entirely without news outside by the steps of the bike shop mr henry did a stand up in front of his fox camera the reason she had a news conference is because i started shouting questions he crowed to his viewers he called that the day s bottom line small victories advertisement
