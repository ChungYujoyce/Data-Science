 2016 with caucuses in washington alaska and hawaii the senator has a fighting chance in all three contests by daniel strauss 03 26 2016 07 54 am edt bernie sanders speaks to an overflow crowd on march 20 2016 before a campaign rally in seattle ap photo bernie sanders has the money and momentum to keep his campaign going all the way through to the democratic convention but if he s going to do it as anything other than an also ran to hillary clinton the vermont senator needs wins in contests like the ones coming saturday washington state alaska and hawaii all hold democratic nomination contests on saturday and sanders has a fighting chance for a sweep all three states are holding caucuses an activist heavy format that sanders has thrived on washington state and alaska are also heavy on white democrats a core sanders constituency and have relatively few african americans hawaii is a wild card given a lack of polling and campaign attention but clinton surrogates are already working to deflate expectations advertisement the opportunity comes packaged with peril however in a race to 2 383 delegates clinton leads sanders 1 690 to 946 even if superdelegates are discounted she s still ahead by 303 pledged delegates and after getting clobbered in the midwest and beaten in arizona sanders is in danger of sliding back into irrelevance if he can t score wins in the states that lean in his favor win or lose clinton or sanders will sit with saturday s consequences for a while other than april 5 s tilt in wisconsin the race goes into semi hibernation without a major contest coming before new york s 291 delegate scrap april 19 democrats in three states on saturday dole out 142 delegates saturday here s are the risks rewards and likely outcomes in washington alaska and hawaii washington 101 delegates only four states are left on the democratic primary calendar with more delegates at stake than washington but right now neither candidate can claim to be the favorite to grab them we re kind of in a sweet spot in the calendar i mean after us new jersey new york pennsylvania and california are the four biggest washington state democratic party chairman jaxon ravens said a couple weeks before us and a couple weeks after us there s an empty space i think the way the race has shaped up is that one thing to remember is we re not a winner take all it s proportional clinton has the support of top democrats there like gov jay inslee and sen maria cantwell has campaigned in the state and she former president bill clinton and chelsea clinton have held fundraisers in the state 2016 by daniel strauss but sanders has been campaigning aggressively the vermont senator s presidential campaign held a rally in seattle s safeco field on friday capacity over 50 000 and a day earlier did an event at the sundome in the yakima nation s treaty territory the campaign estimated that 7 000 people were in attendance he was also recently endorsed by the seattle times the state s most prominent newspaper and they don t call it the left coast for nothing sanders hopes to make hay in deeply progressive seattle and other liberal areas along the state s western edge if senator sanders is ever going to do well i think it would be in washington inslee told politico this week both candidates however have a safety net delegates in democratic caucuses and primaries are awarded proportionally and in a race expected to be tight neither candidate is going home empty handed state democratic officials are expecting huge turnout but they have a system in place that they re hoping will avoid the type of ballot access debacle that struck arizona last week ravens pointed to a new pre check system for democratic caucus voters the state party is using this year for the first time the system essentially allows voters to fill out all the necessary information voters need ahead of time to vote in the caucuses similar to pre checking for an airline flight hawaii 25 delegates polling is non existent in hawaii but local democrats even ones supporting clinton have a straightforward read on saturday a sanders win is expected a clinton victory is a shocker i d be surprised if he doesn t do very well said hawaii county democratic committee chairman phil barnes a top democratic aide to a hawaii lawmaker supporting clinton put it more directly he s going to crush us he should win this thing 2 to 1 at least the aide said of sanders prospects if we keep this below 65 35 i d be shocked the sanders campaign is spending big in search of a blowout in the last month the sanders campaign spent 230 000 on state tv and radio ads while the clinton campaign has spent just 40 000 by eliza collins the vermont senator s campaign has also aggressively deployed rep tulsi gabbard who left her position as a democratic national committee vice chairman to endorse sanders the campaign is looking to take advantage of her popularity there and on friday released a new ad describing her decision to join the military and lapping praise on sanders foreign policy positions clinton however still has the support of most of hawaii s democratic establishment big name democrats like sens brian schatz and mazie hirono as well as rep colleen hanabusa are all supporting her gov david ige the state s new governor who ousted former gov neil abercrombie in 2014 is staying neutral at least publicly he ll vote for hillary and i think when he goes up to philadelphia i would be shocked if he didn t cast his vote for her as a super delegate a top democrat involved with the clinton campaign in the state said multiple democratic aides said the governor has been on some of the campaign s strategy calls in the state but hasn t been willing to openly endorse clinton yet ige s office didn t immediately respond to requests for comment still clinton s campaign did as much as it could in the state the democratic aide said they ve done a little bit of mail a little bit of digital they didn t send us a surrogate and i think with all of that there is a real problem with enthusiasm especially for clinton because there hasn t been anything to gin it up the aide said alaska 16 delegates clinton hasn t spent much time or energy in alaska and the sanders campaign is hoping to pounce on what the democratic frontrunner left for the taking the state is fertile ground for a sanders it s a majority white caucus state with an anti establishment flavor the state also went for obama over clinton in 2008 and the sanders campaign has spent 61 000 on tv and radio advertising in march while clinton has not spent any money the larger view among democrats though is that while clinton is popular there s more enthusiasm toward sanders bernie sanders has been doing a very good job with his ground game here alaska house minority leader chris tuck d said going on to say the state has an anti establishment inclination and we also get upset with wall street and some of the banking bailouts so that plays a huge factor too that plays into sanders support neither candidate has really campaigned there at all but jane sanders the senator s wife did a town hall over the weekend and that was a boost for sanders more so than it would be in other states said jim lottsfeldt the former senior adviser to the pro mark begich put alaska first pac we never never get a taste of a candidate here lottsfeldt said so actually having sanders wife here this weekend is huge i suspect he s going to do well but i know that the mainstream i show up to every meeting democrat seems to be for hillary so i could be wrong but it just feels like there s more enthusiasm for bernie sanders the clinton campaign hasn t left the state totally off its radar though on friday the campaign released a robocall by former president bill clinton across the state encouraging democrats to vote missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020
