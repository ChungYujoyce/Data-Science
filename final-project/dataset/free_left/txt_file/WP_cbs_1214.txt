itunes spotifyandstitcher intelligence matters evelyn farkas correspondent michael morell producer olivia gazis jamie benson michael morell so evelyn welcome to the show it s great to have you on intelligence matters and more importantly it s great to see you again evelyn farkas likewise likewise this is great michael morell so maybe the place to start is with your background and what i d love to know is how did you get interested in national security how did you get interested in russia and eurasia can you kind of talk us through all of that evelyn farkas yeah so i like to say i come on my interest in international affairs honestly i come at it honestly meaning i was the child of hungarian refugees so as you know because you re part hungarian michael morell yes i am evelyn farkas laugh both my parents left hungary after the 56 revolution so they were fleeing communism came here with nothing had to start over again learn english i didn t learn english actually until i went to kindergarten and i was four years old they moved out to westchester county which is a fantastic place to raise a family excellent public schools that is really what i credit my success to really the fact that they moved there of course coming to america was the first start and i just was really schooled growing up on the bad history that we had had and primarily involving europe world war i world war ii michael morell how did they talk evelyn farkas the holocaust michael morell about what it was like to live in communist hungary evelyn farkas oh well they didn t have to explain it because i also experienced it so when i was two was the first time it was safe for them to go back and then they went back a couple of times as i was growing up so i actually went and visited my grandparents and they would say don t speak loudly in front of that lady she s living in they divided my grandparents house up into apartments and because that was what communism was about no one should have a bigger home than anyone else and one of the ladies they put in the house intentionally was spying she was reporting to the government on our conversations and you can imagine laugh kids running around would say whatever probably i was about ten at the time that they told that to me so i knew very very clearly that there was not freedom to say what i wanted even as a ten year old under communism i saw the economic disparity at that age we would bring huge suitcases full of everything jam levis of course that was legendary but medical things aspirin communism was not a good system it was repressive right you didn t have freedom of expression you couldn t say what you wanted without fear of going to jail and then economically it was horrible ultimately it collapsed because of both things really but the economic one was something everyone felt michael morell and what was it about their character right that led them to say we re leaving we re going to find a better life evelyn farkas well so in part it was not character it was just the circumstances they were born into and raised under which is to say that they were considered intelligentsia so they were educated my father because he was already 30 when he left hungary my mother was younger but she came from a middle class family and so again had property also in my father s case so they were already considered suspect enemies of the state they were already relegated to lesser jobs my father who had been a lawyer trained to be a lawyer and a judge was doing manual labor then he was lucky enough to get an office job but when the revolution broke out he participated he was there when the protestors took over the radio station and he knew that when the russian tanks came back because the reason people could escape was the russians left the small russian military contingent that was there was defeated by the protestors but the soviet union was going to come back and so everybody took the opportunity before the soviets came back michael morell i see evelyn farkas to leave and my father was one of those because he recognized that when the soviets came back they were going to say oh that guy was there participating in the protests in my mother s case it was her parents knew she would have no future economically under that system and they wanted her to have a future and actually my grandparents stayed behind with two very young children and their other four children left hungary the two girls together my mother with her sister and her sister s best friend and the parents that i can t even imagine my mother was i think 17 at the time and her sister was 16 leaving them in the care of someone else to cross an international border not knowing if they would see them again but my grandparents on both sides on my father s side only his mother was alive but they understood they wanted their children to have freedom and they were very educated so i think that was part of what motivated both my parents michael morell so did your parents experience and your own experience does that influence how you think about immigration evelyn farkas absolutely absolutely first of all people who are fleeing their countries they re doing it out of necessity either political necessity or economic necessity and the one thing we learned coming out of world war ii was that we had done a grave injustice to many people first and foremost the jewish people who were fleeing a holocaust in europe and they came to our shores and we turned hundreds of them away thousands probably i don t know the actual number but that was a crime and after the second world war as you well know the united states we were at the vanguard of setting up systems so that we couldn t commit those international crimes again that we wouldn t inflict further harm and damage and death upon people so i believe strongly in international law if people want to seek refuge in the united states they should have the opportunity we will process them they may not be actually able to stay in the united states and live here because they may not meet the criteria but there is a fair system in place i think we need more people we need more money we need to man the border better but i don t think the answer is to be hostile all of the immigrants who have come to the united states have contributed greatly we are a country of immigrants and actually if we want further economic growth in america we d better be taking more immigrants in michael morell so your interest in national security comes from that experience can you just talk a little bit about your career then your time on the hill on the armed services committee and then your time in the executive branch evelyn farkas yeah so i ll start a little earlier because i said i learned about this horrible history i went to graduate school at the fletcher school of law and diplomacy michael morell yeah there s these great books called horrible histories have you ever evelyn farkas yeah laugh michael morell seen them evelyn farkas no but michael morell they re for kids and they re particularly for boys to get boys interested in history but they re all the gory stuff of history right in this kind of comic book format but it got both of my boys interested in history anyway evelyn farkas okay i have five nephews michael morell they re called horrible histories evelyn farkas i m taking laugh notes and i have also five godchildren and there are boys there so what i did was i went to graduate school and i determined to study diplomacy because i wanted to prevent all this horror and i studied ethnic conflict and nationalism and the crazy thing was while i was in grad school the war in bosnia came to an end and i had an opportunity to go as a human rights officer in the immediate aftermath and one of the things that really sort of marked me deeply was that experience because i went on exhumations they dig up the bodies michael morell yeah yeah evelyn farkas in these sites of the war crimes where people were murdered and the thing that i describe most vividly because it s the thing i never forgot was seeing among the bones and the dirt this pink parka of this little girl probably six years old who had fled with her family into the forest and was killed in the forest with her family so that again i was like we are the strongest military power in the world when i go to washington which i did as you said subsequently i m going to work so that american military might keeps us safe and keeps the world safer we need a strong military in order to do that we need deterrence in order to do that so i worked on the senate armed services committee as you said for seven years for carl levin drafting and passing legislation as a senior staffer was involved in all kinds of discussions including his no vote on the iraq war interestingly most people don t know about that michael morell right right evelyn farkas yeah and he had an alternative resolution which was to give more time to the inspectors and then as you said i went into the administration and my last job i was working for president obama as deputy assistant secretary of defense for russia ukraine eurasia which is in the headlines now i did not anticipate when i took the job i thought i was just protecting eastern european laugh democracies and it turned out no i was actually working on defending our democracy as well michael morell so here s the fundamental question right a career national security official nonpartisan nonpolitical and you ve made the decision to run for congress evelyn farkas right michael morell why evelyn farkas i never would have foreseen this if i thought about it maybe as a retired person i might have done something political if anything honestly i feel like it s an all hands on deck moment what s happening internationally and domestically requires all of us to be more actively engaged and i literally was in tbilisi georgia republic of georgia about a month laugh ago or no feels like a month ago september woke up at 4 00 in the morning thinking what if this president gets reelected what will i do because i disagree with him deeply on everything and i think he s dangerous for our country and so i said to myself i m going to get involved politically because what i had been doing up until then as you know was think tank type work and working on msnbc as a contributor and i thought that s not going to cut it michael morell you were doing what i m doing evelyn farkas exactly laugh yeah which is important it s explaining to people what s at stake it s helping them think through what their positions are that s very important but i suddenly thought i could do more if he wins again i ll do more well literally two weeks later my representative my hometown representative nita lowey announced that she was retiring and so it started a whole process because friends of mine i had told them proudly i had my plan b for if laugh trump wins and so ultimately i was convinced that the voters want and not just in my district but elsewhere they want someone who understands what s at stake when it comes to national security it s not the fundamental reason they elect someone to congress but it s an additional reason michael morell so there s a pattern here you re not evelyn farkas laugh yes michael morell the first national security person to run for congress and you re not the first female national security person so we have a elissa evelyn farkas yes michael morell slotkin we have abigail spanberger right we have all these people who had a career in national evelyn farkas mikie sherrill i just saw her michael morell security exactly so is there something special about women from national security who have decided to run for political office or am i making too much of that do you think evelyn farkas i don t know if the gender part matters i d have to think about that a little bit more but certainly national security people because i have to hasten to point out my friend tom malinowski who ran successfully from new jersey running again jason crow so there are a host of men max rose from new york also so there are a host of male national security experts so i think it s probably more that national security people who as you said have tended to be nonpartisan mainly because what s at stake on the national security front we have all agreed across the aisle on what the fundamental principles are and what the objectives are but for the first time we ve seen a president where he s caused sharp disagreement he s really overturned what we considered sort of the consensus among republicans and democrats and so that i think has galvanized a lot of us to say wait a minute he s actually overturning the entire order of things it s not the how we do what we do it s what we disagreed let s say when i worked for carl levin with president bush about how we achieve a safer world right but we didn t disagree that we needed to be part of nato that we needed to work with allies there were a lot of things that we agreed on fundamentally michael morell and i know there s a lot of other issues right that are extraordinarily important to people their jobs and their health care and all that kind of stuff but you re kind of special because you ve got this national security background and i m wondering to what extent the folks that you talk to in your district and who you are trying to get to vote for you how interested are they in the world how interested are they in what america is doing in the world compared to all those other issues evelyn farkas yeah so the electorate in my district is actually very interested in how we are behaving in the world but more importantly i would say first and foremost they are interested in how our world approach how our foreign policy impacts them right so the environment my district has the hudson river running through it people in my district are very concerned about rising water levels about sewage overflowing into their properties and also into protected areas right marshlands so it s important to them as a first order issue right and when i go to fora i m actually quite surprised because people will bring that up almost immediately the other thing is that this president has fomented a great sense of insecurity economic insecurity but also he s done nothing about gun safety he s threatened to take away our health care he s eroded women s rights so that fear factor i address it by saying i want to reinstate i want to protect the american dream the american dream is a positive thing don t be afraid your government can actually help you right we will protect your democracy we will protect your right to a rule of law and at the same time we ll provide you with some economic security by for example a public option in health care so i try to address the fears that the president just likes to stoke by kind of speaking about it as a positive agenda michael morell so were there factors that as you thought about running were holding you back from making that decision were there downsides evelyn farkas yes so i spend a lot of time i m sure you ve heard this from other people you know in this town who run for office calling people up asking for donations it s a very weird thing it s like running a startup business but you re asking people to invest in your campaign there s no pot of money right from the beginning so i basically hire a team of experts very dedicated hardworking people i don t pay them right away because i have to first raise the money so that s an odd aspect of it i don t really like it very much but it does bring me back in touch with old laugh friends so that s michael morell yeah yeah yeah yeah evelyn farkas a positive thing michael morell by the way i don t like making phone calls laugh and raising money either i would find that extraordinarily difficult evelyn farkas yeah it s for a michael morell and i wouldn t like it evelyn farkas good cause i m really going to work my butt off and defend democracy and economic opportunity but yeah michael morell so maybe we could shift a little bit and talk about some national security issues and then come back again at the end to the campaign but maybe the place to start is with iran we ve just been through a pretty incredible two weeks with the iranians your thoughts on that evelyn farkas yeah look my thought on it is and i don t think this will surprise you because you know how this works in government when you conduct an attack of this nature of this magnitude of this kind of import right taking this guy out was a really big move because he was not just a military leader he was kind of like a minister of defense and a minister of foreign affairs and a military leader sort of rolled up into one right and so we should have had a plan first and foremost to address any backlash but it should have been embedded in a greater strategy of what we re doing in the middle east and just like the two times that the president announced we were withdrawing troops from syria it seems to be a one off kind of helter skelter move and these are really dangerous things to do because we are now at risk the iranians they ve attacked the two bases with missiles right there was a loss of life a significant loss of life in the takedown of the ukrainian aircraft which is just horrible the ukrainians and the canadians the huge loss of life of all the people on board so my biggest beef with it is that i m not bemoaning or mourning the death of the general it s just that it was done in a way that was not well thought out and ultimately it brought us closer to potential conflict with iran now it looks like the iranians stepped back but again war should be a last resort we should do what we can to deter and punish if necessary but manage it michael morell so evelyn the one thing that i struggle with on the soleimani strike is this question of whether there was intelligence right about evelyn farkas right michael morell the iranians planning significant attacks against u s facilities in the middle east and i say to myself gosh if that intelligence existed and somebody put it in front of me and the interagency concluded that best way to disrupt these attacks and save the lives of a couple hundred u s service members or u s diplomats was to take this guy out i d raise my right hand and say i m all in right evelyn farkas right right michael morell so how do you think about that piece of it evelyn farkas yeah so i agree with you i think if there was really an imminent attack being planned on american citizens absolutely that would have been a very viable option and if taking soleimani out if the intelligence community determined that that would have foiled the attacks then i think it s warranted the problem is that as we heard from members of congress including senator mike lee who s a republican that is not the case that was put before members of congress when they unfortunately after the fact informed them because there s a long tradition of telling key leadership the top leaders of congress right before you take an action like this i was on the hill and i remember very clearly how that worked and my boss would know things before anyone else would know right it was not just a courtesy it was smart because congress pays for these things they pay for the missiles so my perspective on it is that if that intelligence did not exist if there was no clear intelligence that we had high degree of confidence in right to use intelligence terminology that again made it much less justifiable internationally which again puts america at risk because the other part of this is that we didn t inform the allies in advance either michael morell so you talked about the need for a strategy in the middle east what would that look like evelyn farkas well first and foremost it would be a vision of how we want to put an end to the war in syria how we want to create more constructive relationships among the great actors in the region it would be mainly a diplomatic effort what this administration has done is to focus on putting pressure on iran only frankly mollycoddle is the word that comes to term but basically cozying up inappropriately to the murderous saudi regime even though we need saudi arabia but again the way we ve approached saudi arabia has been inappropriate the way we ve approached iran has been to withdraw from the nuclear deal which did put a brake on their program and put additional pressure on iran with the idea being that somehow iran would cave and we would get a better diplomatic deal except that there has been no plan as far as i can see to bring iran to that negotiating table to get that better deal all we did was put iran s back to the wall ratchet up the tension it resulted in back and forth military action and no greater security for anyone in the world michael morell so let s go to your favorite country russia laugh so you were actually at the pentagon when we were being attacked when our democracy evelyn farkas yes michael morell was being evelyn farkas well actually i d left after the electoral attack michael morell okay but this country you evelyn farkas but i understood it laugh michael morell yeah this country that you have been following your entire life right attacked our democracy and they re still at it talk a little bit about why they re doing that number one and number two what should we be doing about it that we re not evelyn farkas right so vladimir putin sitting in the kremlin he would like a sphere of influence he d like to go back to the soviet system why because he likes the corrupt economic system he likes the autocratic system that s what keeps him in power that s what keeps his cronies in power they don t want a full fledged democracy they don t want the countries that used to belong to the soviet union to be democratic they want them as part of their sphere of influence well guess what the only country that can really prevent that is the most powerful country in the world the united states and we are the country that has stood up for the eastern european countries to have the right to pick their system of government and their political allegiances meaning nato or the european union and so putin determined at some point in time look long ago it predates really 2016 but certainly when he came back to power in 2011 he wanted to weaken us he wanted to weaken our international influence and ultimately divide us as much as possible against one another some of that is actually soviet tactics as you probably know from your long intelligence career back in those days they would use our racial tensions use the weaknesses in our society against us but what they did this time was they used our technology to directly get at our citizens to directly go to african americans and say don t go and vote for hillary clinton because she s not on your side through facebook right and then of course they stole information and in the past the soviets would use the information against us privately but they made it public they weaponized it politically so that s just some examples of what they did of course they also approached trump folks in his campaign and tried to get them to work with them we don t know the full story of that because mueller told us some of it but we don t actually know the whole story michael morell so i assume that you think that it is a huge deal right the fact that they attacked our democracy evelyn farkas absolutely michael morell i called it the political equivalent of 9 11 evelyn farkas yeah michael morell do the folks in your district understand the significance of what the russians did or do you have to end up explaining it to them evelyn farkas i think that on some level they do certainly the ones who are really big supporters of hillary clinton feel that somehow she was robbed of the election and that the russians probably had something to do with it do they understand exactly how it might have happened that for example cambridge analytica had information on voters swing voters that was then provided through paul manafort to the russian government because had that kilimnik guy who was a known russian actor as a conduit potentially to the russian intelligence services meaning that important voter data got to the russians which could have then be used by them to manipulate facebook and the other social media we don t have the fingerprints for all that as far as i know so do my voters do my future constituents understand that i don t think they understand the granularity of it but they know something went wrong some people have come up to me in public fora and either privately or publicly asked are we out of the woods should we be worried about this next presidential election and my answer to that is we are not out of the woods the intelligence community told us that the russians are still actively attacking us and it s not just the elections they re sitting on electric grids on water supply grids on infrastructure and this is something the intelligence community reported on to the american people but i feel it somehow has gotten lost that the media is not covering it and what that is all about is a backup plan if they want to coerce the united states they want to keep us out of a conflict or they want to somehow get their way with us they can use the bots that they have in our systems to cut off electricity it s pretty extreme right we don t expect them to do it because they should be smart enough to know how america responds when we re attacked in that fashion you mentioned 9 11 pearl harbor but nevertheless that s how the russians operate michael morell so i m sure you ve thought about this but if i were the russians i d come after you right evelyn farkas well they do every day michael morell because evelyn farkas i check my twitter feed laugh michael morell you re exactly the kind of person they don t want in congress so do you see any activity on the part of the russians that s aimed against you evelyn farkas yes as i said on twitter all the time there are bots and i m constantly reporting them but what can you do and some people don t know they re russian bots so there are actual people who also re tweet russian propaganda right now it s very focused on ukraine and besmirching ukraine and biden and all of that i also worry about hacks so we re very careful in my campaign about our security we watch everything very carefully and i have a paranoid perspective but rightfully so michael morell so the last big one and maybe the most i mportant at the end of the day is china evelyn farkas right michael morell for what the world is going to look like there s probably no more important relationship than the one between beijing and washington and some people have just focused on trade but i m sure you agree there are much bigger issues here so how do you think about what our approach to china should be evelyn farkas right so first of all i would say with china we have a chance to have a constructive relationship if we re firm and if we stick to international law and international institutions and work hard to shore them up and make it clear to the chinese that there are rules of the road and they have to abide by them and that s on trade and that s on issues of sovereignty issues relating to hong kong taiwan so my perspective is that the chinese government unlike the russian government they still think the status quo the international system offers them some benefit right because they re not trying to overturn it the way the russians are so we should use that to our advantage and make it clear again that they have to play by the rules because they have watched closely how we ve allowed russia to get away with murder literally and a whole host of other things right so i think on the trade front i m glad the president has been firm with china that s a good thing because they were playing so unfairly in the economic arena but the president also has weakened wto which is the place where we enforce the international rules of the road on trade so we need to shore up the international system we need to make it clear to the chinese that they have to abide by the law on issues of sovereignty so south china sea the territorial disputes that the chinese have with their neighbors there i think we need to be more creative we need to use more robust democracy because even the united states has been kind of guilty of relying too much on deterrence and the military tool right in that conflict in particular when it comes to the south china sea we really should try to shore up the hague tribunal right now the chinese are in violation blatant violation of a hague tribunal decision that came down in favor of the philippines now the philippines are also letting the chinese be in violation of it but i don t think we should and so a lot of it really requires full on attention diplomatic attention we need a secretary of state that will prioritize that in the right way michael morell and i don t think it s possible to succeed with china and not possible to succeed on so many other national security issues without allies evelyn farkas correct michael morell you would evelyn farkas correct michael morell agree evelyn farkas yes and that is i guess the fundamental mistake this president made so while i say that i think it s a good thing that president trump took a firm line with china the mistake he made was then he turned around and took an even firmer line more hostile line towards our closest neighbors and trading partners namely canada and mexico and then our european allies japan south korea you don t go into any kind of battle whether it s economic or military or political without allies that s our biggest asset michael morell yeah so maybe we can talk about national security capabilities a little bit so the strength of our military the strength of our intelligence services the strength of our diplomatic capabilities the strength of our development assistance seems to me that all of those have eroded over the past couple decades you re in kind of a funny situation because i know you agree with having robust capabilities evelyn farkas yes michael morell but you re also in a party where they don t want to spend a lot of money on those things so how do you square that evelyn farkas right well so i don t think you have to pick guns or butter i m for both okay yes so we need to redo our taxes so we can pay for both right right now capital gains are not taxed appropriately right now the very wealthy they didn t ask for this trump tax scam cut and they got this tax cut but meanwhile the middle class took it on the chin in the blue states so in my state of new york it s a real problem for people they already were suffering under the burden of high taxes and what president trump did with his i call it a tax scam legislation really is hurting them every day so we need to address the budget right that s how you get more money into the treasury and then i think the issue is to be smart about where you spend money on defense for example we have a lot of expensive legacy systems by legacy i mean big airplanes and ships that are old and we need to think more creatively about first of all obviously making sure we have access to the newer models and making sure that prices are fair but then also dealing with asymmetric threats because they re the ones that russia s using to attack us so if we don t have better cyber capabilities all of our tanks and aircraft carriers are not going to protect us from a cyber attack and in fact those platforms will be more at risk because they re becoming also increasingly automated so cyber defenses don t cost as much we need to put more money into those the other thing is i really think when you talk about the weakening of those communities intelligence community defense community diplomatic and development what i think we re really talking about first and foremost is the weakening of morale the loss of experienced personnel because they were hounded politically under this administration what happened with regard to this ukraine bribery scandal that the president unleashed upon all of us resulted in very excellent as we saw on television foreign service officers being attacked and they are senior and everyone below them is watching and so i think the biggest problem is leadership what a president and the president s cabinet are supposed to do is provide leadership boost morale and that is a really important resource in and of itself michael morell so evelyn let me maybe finish up here with two questions the first is how do you bring people together right how do you bring americans together at a time when politically you need to attack the president to win the primary that you re fighting right so how do you do both of those things at the same time evelyn farkas i think you appeal to what people care about day to day again i mentioned taxes i mentioned the environment people want to work together on these things they are happy to work across the aisle as well initially you do have to though have a political fight you have to have a political debate you have to make very clear that there is climate change that all the scientists in the climate change field agree 100 of them that there is human caused climate change that we re facing a crisis and we have to act now or yesterday so i think we do need to be blunt and we do need to speak clearly but when we talk about what to do there is a way to do it i suppose if people want to deny what caused the climate change you can still work with them to address it right so i can see myself going to congress and dealing with people on the other side of the aisle who still refuse to believe the science behind the climate crisis but might still be concerned because the water level is rising in their communities as well michael morell yeah and then the last question is running for office and sticking to your values i know that you are a person of deep integrity but i want to tell you a little bit about my experience i did a few media events for the clinton campaign and i would talk to the media and i really deeply believed that she would have made a great commander in chief and certainly a better commander in chief than donald trump and so i said that and i believed it but i also at the very same time felt pressure to spin a little bit to kind of go beyond the facts and i really tried to fight that but i found in the middle of a heated campaign that that is difficult to do and i know that you re a person of integrity do you feel that same kind of pressure evelyn farkas yes so you have political advisors and they ll tell you our position is this and then i ll say no no wait a minute laugh what s my position you know and you can give me options right but number one i may actually have a really firm view on x y or z i may be open to hearing options but ultimately it s my position i m not putting forward some position that the party has decided should be my position so i think that s the beauty of being 52 years old and running for office i think when i was younger it would have been harder to resist it and if you know who you are inside your soul then it s easier to resist and i m sure though that there will be moments where i ll have to check and say wait a minute wait a minute over and over again probably i m just starting this and i feel very clearly about what i believe and i think bearing that in mind but it s easier when you re more mature when you already have a strong sense of self and what you believe in michael morell evelyn thank you so much for joining us evelyn farkas thank you michael thanks so much end of transcript first published on february 5 2020 6 00 am 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
