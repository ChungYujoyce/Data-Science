today donate jeff chiu ap a fund congress created to help rescue small businesses initially struggled to deliver relief to hurting firms now that it s been replenished the strict rules and confusing guidance surrounding the fund s loans has stopped many recipient businesses from spending them according to a new story from the new york times for weeks small businesses expressed outrage over the paycheck protection program which grants forgivable loans to businesses with fewer than 500 employees facing dire economic straits in a pandemic induced depression the initial 350 billion congress set aside for the program which covers two month s worth of payroll rent and utility expenses ran out in just two days asbigger well connected firms such as ruth s chris steak house and potbelly s hustled to secure large sums many larger businesses such as shake shack and the los angeles lakers returned their loans amidst the backlash congress added an additional 310 billion the program last month but as the times details the loans haven t been enough to keep businesses solvent and employees on the job george evageliou who owns a woodworking company in brooklyn told the times that the federal government made the program so hard to use and that it s start ing to feel like a lose lose situation much of that stems from terms of the loan it can be forgiven only if a firm hires back three quarters of its employees and spends the whole sum within eight weeks of receiving it with a sluggish economy with few signs of recovery and some states pushing their shelter in place orders into june many employers suspect they ll just have to lay off their employees again after the two months run out business owners are also afraid of not clearly following the rules of the program which are complicated ambiguous and evolving says thetimes the small business association which administers the loans has been continuous updating loan guidance beyond the terms laid out in the cares act the legislation that created the program i don t accidentally want to commit bank fraud jodi burns the owner of a donut shopin guilford conn told thetimes the result the times concludes is that many of the small businesses that did get loans are sitting on the money unsure about whether and how to spend it and in turn compromising the effectiveness of a program meant to help stabilize the country s reeling economy in the piece business ownerssay they wish the program allowed them moreflexibility to use the money on protective equipment for their workers tweak their business model to make it more
