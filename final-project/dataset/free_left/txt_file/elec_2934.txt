 2016 worried about security these voters are shifting toward ted cruz by katie glueck 11 21 2015 12 19 pm est updated 11 22 2015 05 23 pm est republican presidential candidates ben carson and sen ted cruz walk on the stage at the start of the presidential family forum in iowa ap photo sioux city iowa hours after terrorists attacked a hotel in mali and a week after islamic state fighters struck paris ted cruz took the floor here to deliver a harsh critique of president barack obama s middle east posture and pledge a hard line approach to syrian muslim refugees it was exactly what this crowd of mostly conservative christians wanted and an ominous sign for iowa s weakened front runner ben carson advertisement across the state and at a major gathering of politically active evangelicals on friday night foreign policy was top of mind for the voters and state lawmakers once considered natural constituents for carson but after a week of confused comments from the retired neurosurgeon and a dismissive critique by his own advisers iowans are now consistently voicing doubt about carson s credentials to be commander in chief indeed they said the terrorist attacks have reordered the candidates in their mind lifting cruz and sen marco rubio and for many making carson an afterthought he s a great guy he s fun to listen to but i didn t hear anything substantive said alan hilgerson a des moines based physician who said national security is an extremely high priority for him as he considers the 2016 contenders vying for iowa of carson he continued i don t know that i d want him as my president worse yet for carson at the family leader forum organized by social conservative icon bob vander plaats voters said the more they thought about carson s foreign policy credentials the less comfortable they were with him by katie glueck marilu erdahl who drove 2 hours in the snow to see the candidates speak making her exactly the kind of republican the candidates count on during the wintry caucuses said she entered the event torn between cruz and carson but as she talked through the importance of national defense she decided on cruz he has experience he s shown what he can do she said of cruz with the state of affairs we re in right now i think it is very important it s vital we need someone who knows the ropes who s not the establishment but who doesn t need on the job training she went on i guess i ve maybe made up my mind carson and cruz have been racing toward this collision in iowa for weeks both have been courting the same christian conservative community that makes up a crucial bloc of the state s caucus electorate but the turning point came when security and foreign policy were forced to the top of the gop agenda by the terrorist attacks carson landed here fresh off a string of fumbles that included struggling to name countries he d ask to join a coalition to fight the group known as isis or isil and smarting from a new york times story that featured one of his own foreign policy advisers saying the candidate was struggling to grasp key issues the momentum according to activists state lawmakers and other voters here now appears to be with cruz and he seems to know it on the republican side i think the paris attacks infuse a greater seriousness to the search for who is prepared to be commander in chief who has the experience who has the judgment who has the understanding of the very real and growing threats facing america cruz told politico in an interview in iowa by nick gass the overlay of the paris attacks even today the horrific attack in mali makes clear that we need a president who s prepared on day one to understand the nature of the threats facing america and to lead this country in standing up to these threats and defending our citizens from the growing menace of radical islamic terrorism he said on the sidelines of the family leader event influential iowa vote broker steve king who endorsed cruz last week pointed to a new online nbc poll that showed carson dropping and said he attributed that slip to renewed interest in national security and carson s struggles with the issue polls conducted by more traditional methods will provide a fuller picture in coming weeks they ll often say all politics are local politics are domestic domestic politics will elect the next president i m not sure that s right not when you see the pictures of the bodies in places like paris and around the world beirut now mali today king said when we see that and we re almost guaranteed that s going to continue until we defeat terrorists that makes a candidate that s strong on foreign policy strong on national defense that makes that candidate stronger being from outside the beltway doesn t help with that being inside the beltway as long as you re not ruled by that i think does help king said in interviews with voters and activists at stops in conservative western iowa and then at the presidential forum in des moines it was clear they do not see carson as equally up to the challenge in fact the characteristics once cited by voters here as boosting carson his soft spoken nature and disinterest in attacking his competition for example are now seen as problematic carson he s a wonderful guy but we like cruz better said judy kirby of des moines who said she is gravely concerned about foreign policy in the wake of several high profile terrorist attacks cruz seems more knowledgeable he seems stronger voters described carson as lacking fire in the belly as being a nice person but too soft spoken and said he doesn t come across as sufficiently tough that s in contrast to both donald trump a tough talker who pledges to bomb the sh out of isil and cruz and rubio who have both sought to demonstrate senate acquired policy chops republican presidential candidates sen marco rubio ben carson and sen ted cruz are introduced at the presidential family forum on november 20 2015 in des moines iowa getty it s probably one of carson s weakest stances said chris boley a business owner who attended the family leader event and is now leaning toward rubio that doesn t mean he can t get up to speed but he has some catching up to do in this day and age with how important national defense is with terrorism in the middle east you ve got to be real studied at two campaign stops on friday followed by an appearance at a conservative cattle call cruz tried to highlight just how studied he is on both terrorism and the refugee crisis and at each site king stressed that part of the reason he is backing cruz is that he trusts the texas senator to play hardball with world leaders a qualification that resonated with the hawkish mood of the crowds they cheered cruz s analysis of the chaos in the middle east something he blames on both obama and former secretary of state hillary clinton and his with us or against us language on isil if you join isis you are signing your death warrant cruz pledged voters also embraced cruz s concerns about syrian refugees coming to america fears shared by many in the audiences cruz said that syrian refugees who he conceded are suffering from a humanitarian crisis should be resettled not in the united states but in the middle east cruz said the united states is already spending huge sums to help refugees carson also opposes allowing in syrian refugees but cruz has made a legislative push on the effort a washington credential he repeatedly points to on friday night carson tried to demonstrate national security chops accusing obama of tying american troops hands and of being an armchair quarterback who is interfering tremendously he earned applause for those remarks and was well received when more broadly criticizing political correctness but cruz seated next to carson on stage quickly and easily upstaged him obama cruz said was worse than an armchair quarterback the policies he s advocating are helping the other team the crowd rewarded him with applause and whistles missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020 politico llc
