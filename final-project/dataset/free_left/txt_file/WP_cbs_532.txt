as tech companies face increased scrutiny apple is putting a focus on user privacy and making changes to some of its most well known products at monday s worldwide developers conference the company announced it s developing new protections for users showed off updated versions of ios and said goodbye to itunes those rollouts come at a critical time for the company as sales of its iphone continue to sag and the ongoing trade war between the u s and china threatens its core business in an exclusive interview with incoming cbs evening news anchor and managing editor norah o donnell ceo tim cook addressed everything from fake news to tariffs below is an extended portion of their conversation norah o donnell you spent a lot of time talking about privacy and security tim cook yeah o donnell why cook because i think it s one of the most important issues of the century we see privacy as a fundamental human right and we re very worried that the place that we re all in right now is a place that has dire consequences and you can see some of those that have played out over the last several years and the awareness is building but basically we want to give tools to users to protect their privacy i mean there is extraordinary amounts of detailed information about people that i don t think should really exist that are out there today o donnell when i listened to that today that new innovation of that apple sign on i thought this is apple taking a shot at the way facebook and google is using all of our data cook you know we re not really taking a shot at anybody we focus on the user and the user wants the ability to go across numerous properties on the web without being under surveillance we re moving privacy protections forward and i actually think it s a very reasonable request for people to make o donnell do you think facebook cares about our private security cook i think that everybody s beginning to care more people are becoming more aware of what s been happening many people are getting more offended i think this is good because we need to shine a light on it you can imagine an environment where everyone begins to think there s no privacy and if there s no privacy your freedom of expression just plummets because now you re going to be thinking about that everybody s gonna know every single thing you re doing this is not good for our country not good for democracy o donnell i know you had urged congress to try and pass some legislation to deal with this issue congress hasn t acted right cook they haven t i m hoping that they do we re actively pushing and giving suggestions and so forth we re gonna continue to do that i think the country needs to move forward here and i think it needs to be some pretty bright lines o donnell but don t i as an american and a user of this data have a right to know how my data is being used or sold cook yes you do you have a right to do that and you have the right to stop it in my mind and you have a right to change it a right to delete it o donnell but do i have the ability to do that cook no you don t today i mean there s so many companies out there that have your data that you ve never even heard of o donnell so if the government is not acting what s apple doing to fix that problem cook well we re not waiting for the government to act we re pushing forward and i hope that everyone that wants to not be surveilled across the internet i hope they use our sign on o donnell want to ask you about itunes it cook yeah o donnell was launched 18 years ago cook yeah it s been a while o donnell eighteen years ago is it bittersweet sorta shutting it down cook well we re not really shutting it down most people associate itunes with the ability to purchase music at the song level and we re still doing that what we re doing is we ve recognized that there ve been so many things put into itunes from audio or from music to podcasts to video and all the rest that we need to separate these things out so it s clear where you go for what o donnell i want toask you about screen time cook yeah o donnell do you know how much screen time you use every day cook i do because i get a report every week you re probably getting this too and it tells me how many hours per day and what they are made of you know where i m spending my time and i ve found it to be pretty profound one i was spending more time than i thought and even more the case i was getting more notifications and picking up my phone more than i should and so i ve dialed back a whole bunch of notifications and stopped myself from being too antsy about picking up the phone o donnell uh huh so the ceo of apple is saying don t pick up your phone as much cook i m saying we made the phone not so that you ll use it all the time we made the phone to make your life better and everybody has to decide for his or herself what that means but for me my simple rule is if i m looking at the device more than i m looking into someone s eyes i m doing the wrong thing o donnell but i know you ve seen it too tim you can go into a restaurant and you can see a couple maybe even on a first or second date and they re both just staring at their phones cook yeah o donnell what s it doing to us cook what is it doing to us i think everybody has to make their own decision about how they date and so forth i m the last person to go into advise that o donnell but you know what i m saying cook i m certainly not an expert on it myself but i think what we wanted to do was to give people the tools so they have a true north you know like for me and i think many others were kind of surprised by how much they were using it and picking it up and notifications i hope everyone dials back if they want to right o donnell uh huh i mean the iphone is arguably the most successful consumer product ever created in mankind and yet parents and people are struggling with really how to use it is it shortening our attention span changing the way we interact cook i haven t seen evidence of that but users have told us started telling us hey my kids are using it too much but we also learned something else was that parents are also spending too much time and so the screen time is really focused on both kids and parents because all of us if we know what we re doing we can make changes that we want to make o donnell let me ask you about some other news today the government is looking into big tech essentially whether companies like facebook google and apple are too big is apple too big cook no i don t thinks so i think that with size i think scrutiny is fair i think we should be scrutinized but if you look at any kind of measure about is apple a monopoly or not i don t think anybody reasonable is going to come to the conclusion that apple s a monopoly our share is much more modest we don t have a dominant position in any market o donnell you re saying you re not a monopoly cook we are not a monopoly o donnell but elizabeth warren who s campaigning for president says apple should break up its app store and other parts of its business cook well i strongly disagree with that i think some people would argue if you are selling a good then you can t have a product that competes with that good and i think that s part of what is being argued there but that s an argument that takes you down the path that walmart shouldn t be stocking alternative or house brand and so this is decades of u s law here but i think scrutiny is good and we ll tell our story to anybody that we need to or wants to hear it i feel very confident in our position you know we re on the user s side we re on the user s side in privacy we re on the user s side in trying to prevent fake news and so we curate and we ve always done that we re not an amplifier for fake news or pitting groups against one another or having porn or all this other kind of stuff this is not what we re about and we ve never been about that o donnell is facebook an amplifier for fake news cook i think that any kind of property if you will that pushes news and in a way that is not curated i don t really believe personally that a i has the power today to differentiate between what is fake and what is not and so i worry about any property that today pushes news in a feed and so what we do with our news product we re not creating news but we do pick top stories we have people doing it and so i do worry about people thinking like machines not machines thinking like people o donnell do you worry about what may happen in the next presidential election cook well the answer is i worry that the fake news is not under control and i do worry about outside forces using it to manipulate people s thoughts and so forth so yes i think we should all be concerned i think all of us should be o donnell how hard is apple getting hit by president trump s trade war with china cook well it currently the chinese have not targeted apple at all and i don t anticipate that happening to be honest o donnell but it s been reported if there s a 25 tariff on the iphone xs alone it could add 160 to what is already you know a very expensive device would that hurt sales cook sure it would i m hoping that doesn t happen and i don t anticipate it happening i know people think the iphone is made in china the iphone is assembled in china the truth is the iphone is made everywhere it s made everywhere and so a tariff on the iphone would hurt all of those countries but the one that would be hurt the most is this one o donnell president trump calls you a friend how would you describe your relationship cook i think we ve had very straightforward discussions many of them he listens to the comments which i appreciate sometimes he doesn t agree but my philosophy on things is that you always engage even when you know that you re gonna wind up on very opposite sides because the only way that you change somebody s mind is if you talk now that said you know i have a very different view on daca and other immigration issues on climate change and a set of others but this doesn t prevent me from weighing in on other things that there might be commonality on o donnell because you know there are many other ceos and there are many tech leaders who say they won t even meet with president trump but you engage with the white house regularly cook i do and i m proud to i mean because i don t believe in the i disagree with you and so i don t want to have anything to do with you o donnell president trump and the administration have banned huawei are you concerned that your chinese rival could ultimately retaliate against apple because of that cook i think again i think we ve had a company in china for a long time and so there is a i believe a healthy level of respect for both sides and so i don t anticipate that happening but i m not promising that it will not but i don t anticipate it o donnell immigration cook yeah o donnell i know is an issue you care deeply about and it affects hundreds of your employees you ve spoken directly with the white house about this i know you joined 100 ceos in urging congress to try and pass immigration reform and yet nothing has been done on this cook yeah i m very disappointed in this i think i m worried that we re all losing the humanity of this and getting lost in numbers and politics et cetera i see this simply these folks that we have in apple and i believe they re largely representative of the total dreamer population we have 300 plus they are every bit of as a u s citizen as i am and i just can t conceive why anyone would spend 30 seconds in thinking they re not i mean these are kids that came in at 6 months old and 1 year old and 2 years old they didn t make a decision to climb a wall this is not about numbers this is not about politics this is about humanity o donnell but it is a rallying cry for the president build a wall he s running a reelection campaign on that he s raising money doing it and it s a daily message for him cook yeah i think that immigration is a very complex issue as a whole and so what i m talking about is the daca element of it to me is extremely straightforward and i will be talking about this until my toes point up if it takes that long because i think and honestly norah i believe i d invite anybody out to apple who wants to come meet some because these folks are just incredible americans they deserve the title they deserve to be in this country it would be a travesty if something else happened and so to me that is clear and simple o donnell well tim cook thank you for joining us cook thank
