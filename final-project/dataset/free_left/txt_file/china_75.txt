 tokyo north korea put on a huge military spectacle saturday to celebrate its founder s birthday parading its series of new and technologically advancedmissiles in front of kim jong un and in a defiant show of force in front of the world north korea did not however carry out another nuclear test or ballistic missile launch against widespread speculation that it would seek to celebrate kim il sung s 105th birthday with a bang a timeline of north korea s five nuclear tests and how the u s has responded april 15 is the most important day in the north korean calendar and kim jong un has celebrated his grandfather s birthday with great fanfare as a way to boost his own legitimacy as the successor to the communist dynasty north korea presented two of its newest missiles at the parade in kim il sung square on saturday including thesubmarine launched ballistic missile it successfully fired last year and the land based version it launched last month and there were a lot of them said melissa hanham an expert at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in california the signal that they re trying to send is that they are moving ahead with solid fuel missiles north korea has been working on solid fuel which means missiles are ready to fire and don t need loading with propellant like its previous liquid fueled missiles as a way to fire missiles quickly and without detection by satellites analysts were working to identify all the missiles that were shown off on saturday many of which appeared to have new paint jobs or be variants on known missiles with both the u s and north korea saber rattling is conflict imminent one of the missiles looked similar to the kn 08 intercontinental ballistic missile that north korea had included in previous parades this missile has a theoretical range of about 7 500 miles which is enough to reach all of the united states from north korea said joshua pollack editor of the nonproliferation review it also put two icbm canisters which protect solid fueled missiles from the effects of the environment on the trucks that had carried the icbms previously one may have been a kn 14 another missile capable of reaching the u s mainland although it has a slightly shorter range the trucks that carried the missile canisters were chinese ones that had been exported to north korea s forestry ministry but have shown up in military parades like this one saturday s display was worrying hanham said they have an indigenous tank system now so they have more launchers and they have solid fuel which means they can launch a lot more of these things in quick succession without having to refuel she said the overall message to the world was that north korea was pressing ahead with its missiles and making technological progress the parade took place amid stern warnings from the outside world and mounting fears about some kind of military action in the region the united states hassent an aircraft carrier strike group to the korean peninsula region and president trump has repeatedly tweeted that if china will not use its leverage to rein in north korea the united states will act vice president pence arrives in seoul on sunday on the first leg of an asia tour and he will underscore washington s strong alliances with south korea and japan and their determination to stop north korea s nuclear weapons program china on friday urged the united states and north korea not to push their recriminations to a point of no return and allow war to break out on the peninsula foreign minister wang yi said storm clouds were gathering an apparent reference to north korean preparations to conduct a new nuclear test and the united states deployment of a naval strike force to the waters off the peninsula in addition the u s military has been conducting large scale exercises with south korean forces drills that the north considers provocative why is april 15 such a big deal in north korea the united states and south korea and north korea are engaging in tit for tat with swords drawn and bows bent wang said at a news conference we urge all parties to refrain from inflammatory or threatening statements or deeds to prevent irreversible damage to the situation on the korean peninsula later friday wang called his russian counterpart sergei lavrov and said it was in both countries interests to prevent an outbreak of war china welcomes close collaboration with russia to cool down the korean peninsula situation as quickly as possible and encourage the involved parties to resume dialogue he said according to china s foreign ministry trump administration officials describe the situation as more dangerous than in the past because of the progress north korea has made in its nuclear and missile programs and because of the hostility on both sides but u s officials said no decision has been made about how to respond to any new test nuclear or ballistic by north korea while officials do not rule out other actions they also stress their desire to ensure that the situation does not escalate out of control pentagon officials denied recent media reports that the trump administration is ready to launch a preemptive strike if north korea appears to be about to conduct a nuclear test as north korea celebrates anniversary its neighbors are united by jitters north korea friday accused president trump of making trouble with his aggressive tweets amid concerns that tensions between the two countries could escalate into military action north korea s vice foreign minister said that trump was becoming more vicious and more aggressive than previous presidents and that this was only making matters worse trump is always making provocations with his aggressive words han song ryol told the associated press in an interview in pyongyang so that s why it s not the dprk but the u s and trump that makes trouble he said using the abbreviation for the democratic people s republic of korea as north korea is officially known han also repeated the regime s common refrain that north korea is ready to act to defend itself we ve got a powerful nuclear deterrent already in our hands and we certainly will not keep our arms crossed in the face of a u s preemptive strike han told the ap north korea has a habit of fueling tensions to increase the rewards it might extract from the outside world if it desists previously the north has agreed to return to denuclearization talks in return for aid or the easing of sanctions the north korean army meanwhile threatened to annihilate u s military bases in south korea and the presidential palace in seoul in response to what it called trump s maniacal military provocations kim jong un s rockets are getting an important boost from china but with his approach trump is tearing up the old playbook of how to deal with north korea analysts said this approach to north korea is relatively new said james kim of the asan institute of policy studies in seoul the approach in the past has been very calculated that has gone out the window with talk about military options he said we always knew all these options were there but no one was bold enough to go down that path it s a new approach some in beijing are noticing the shift too it should be noted that there is a personality difference between trump and obama the global times newspaper wrote friday the paper does not speak for the chinese government on policy but often reflects a strain of thinking within the communist party trump is also willing to show he is different bombing syria helps him to show that it continued while noting that he was far from revolutionary because he dispatched only missiles not troops but north korea could prove different if itignores trump swarning and conducts another nuclear test the paper said trump just took the office if he loses to pyongyang he would feel like he had lost some prestige right now trump has some cards to play said kim of the asan institute he might say if you want one less battleship in the region what are you going to give me he said a reversal of the usual situation in which north korea asks what it can get from its
