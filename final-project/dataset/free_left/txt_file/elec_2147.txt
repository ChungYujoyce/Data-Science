no doubt many pundits in the media world will declare republicangov mike pence of indiana the winner of tuesday night s vice presidential debate against democratic sen tim kaine of virginia kaine was admittedly overexcited and his constant interrupting of pence in the first 20 minutes rubbed everyone on the left and right the wrong way meanwhile pence exuded the preternatural calm of a sociopath increasingly frustrating kaine with his ability to endlessly lie about easily checked facts witha disturbingly practiced assurance but while kaine didn t win any points on likability he had a job to do and he got it done pushing out the anti trump talking points and highlighting the vast differences between hillaryclinton campaign s vision for racial justice versus the trump campaign s overt racism and bigotry on that front kaine got the job done he repeatedly dragged the conversation back to issues about racial justice from policing to immigration whichworked to put pence on the defensive whileappealing to black and latino voters and anyone really who cares about racial justice while pence was the living embodiment of an unflappable liar definitely the guy to go to if you need someone to bury the bodies kaine s relentlessness on this front clearly got to him enough that for a brief shining moment he got flustered and angry you whipped out that mexican thing again pence whined it was one of the few memorable lines of the night and the likeliest to grab headlines no doubt latino viewers watching the debate took notice kaine was irritating but pence was downright creepy many of the lies he told don t need fact checking to be read assuch denying trump s bigotry denying his and trump s praise of vladimir putin pretending that it s clinton and not trump who is running an insult driven campaign as he put it people who look you in the eye and lie so boldly without breaking a sweat are creepy and i m sure voters noticed that it doesn t help that pence has a disturbingaffect which is made all the worse by his tendency to crack deeply unfunny jokes and then act really pleased with himself like he s charming and not creepy he even tried to roll out ronald reagan s there you go again line and didn t seem to notice that he couldn t sell it at all he is clearly a man who has spent his life mistaking people s polite laughter for genuine merriment and that inability to read other people comes across as well creepy let s just say that few people who watched that debate are going to welcome further interactions with the governor of indiana kaine scored some good points towards the second half of the debate after pence rolled out some dishonest talking points about the clinton foundation kaine counteredthisperfectly by highlighting the foundation s good work and contrasting it with the sleazy goings on surroundingtrump s foundation and business organizations even managing to inject trump s boy crush on putin into the proceedings later when the topic of abortion came up pence becamepassionate for the first time which led him awfully close to suggesting that women should be forced to give birth so that strangers who want their babies can have them again that reads more as creepy than as pro life but kaine went in for the kill shot asserting that his pro choice views were rooted in his belief in religious freedom and demanding to know why pence doesn t trust women pence could only answer with empty pablum vice presidential debates don t really move the needle of public opinion the only thing campaigns can hope to get out of them is firing uptheir base of voters and lodgingsome good attacks on the opposition s nominee on both those counts kaine hit his mark voters who care about criminal justice orimmigration reform or even reproductive rights will walk away feeling good about the clinton kaine ticket voters who worry about trump s shady business dealings or his coziness with putin werereminded of those concerns repeatedly kaine didn t leave pence as a quivering mass of failure in the same way that clinton devastated trump last week but he did what he set out to do now that that ordeal is over we can get back to far more important things including whetherclinton can wipe the floor with trump yet again and finish him off for good in sunday s town hall debate amanda marcotte is a politics writer for salon who covers american politics feminism and culture her new book troll nation how the right became trump worshipping monsters set on rat f cking liberals america and truth itself is out now she s based out of brooklyn and can be followed on twitter amandamarcotte copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
