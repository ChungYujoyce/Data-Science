join joe keep taking care of yourself and your families and each other keep believing in the possibilities of a better world and i will see you on the campaign trail as soon as i can by glenn thrush over the past year joseph r biden jr and former president barack obama practiced a political distancing of sorts with mr obama maintaining a posture of public neutrality in the democratic primaries offering counsel to any candidate who called most did and mr biden saying he wanted to win on his own but with calibrated stealth mr obama has been considerably more engaged in the campaign s denouement than has been previously revealed even before he endorsed mr biden on tuesday for months mr obama had kept in close contact with senior party officials in hopes of preventing a repeat of the protracted and nasty 2016 primary race then in the weeks after it became clear that mr biden was the party s near certain nominee mr obama telling a friend he needed to accelerate the endgame had at least four long conversations with his former vice president s remaining rival senator bernie sanders mr obama s efforts to ease the senator out of the race played a significant role in mr sanders s decision to end his bid and endorse mr biden according to people close to the vermont independent by that time mr biden and mr obama had already begun hashing out the thorny questions of how when and where to deploy a former president thrust into an unfamiliar role as his sidekick s sidekick how to proceed is a negotiation between friends but a delicate one the terms of the reunion however welcome are complicated by an intermingling of political and personal issues according to interviews with a dozen people close to both men who spoke mostly on the condition of anonymity mr biden s team knew better than to ask mr obama for his overt support during the primary campaign but they felt he might have done more to spare them a few tribulations and were incensed that some former obama advisers especially david axelrod repeatedly questioned mr biden s viability when naomi biden the candidate s granddaughter took to twitter in february to describe the former obama aide as a jerk with a microphone cheering could be heard at the campaign s headquarters in philadelphia according to a person who was present mr axelrod has said he considers himself an impartial observer party officials were more direct prodding mr obama to be more active behind the scenes especially after mr biden had begun his comeback by winning the south carolina primary but the former president often communicating through eric schultz a political aide who has also served as a bridge to the biden campaign insisted that his best use would be as a passive peacemaker he kept his powder dry and that gave him credibility which made all the difference said tom perez the democratic national committee chairman who served as labor secretary under mr obama now with the primary campaign over mr biden and his aides are eager to deploy the former president as quickly as possible especially on fund raising as they race to compete with president trump s small donor juggernaut biden has obviously achieved something huge here on his own but the president is a surrogate unlike anyone else anyone can bring to bear i mean who has trump got said joel benenson mr obama s longtime pollster and a top adviser to hillary clinton in 2016 getting to the point where he can get obama involved you know that s a big deal mr obama is open to whatever the campaign suggests according to several people familiar with his thinking but he continues to counsel caution the better to preserve his political capital and to avoid the perception that he is somehow coming in to rescue mr biden a more immediate matter is the logistical challenge of taking on a sitting president during a pandemic and an economic collapse and mr obama like mr trump is less adept at recording direct to camera pitches than at delivering rousing speeches before live crowds a scenario that social distancing restrictions have made impossible for the foreseeable future the obama endorsement came in a sober but impassioned 12 minute endorsement video released tuesday morning i m so proud to endorse joe biden for president of the united states mr obama said his face shot in close up i believe joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now mr obama offered a preview of how he plans to pitch mr biden less as a traditional stand alone candidate than as the standard bearer for a larger democratic coalition bound by decency and competence and after drawing mr sanders into that fold calling him an american original a man who has devoted his life to giving voice to working people s hopes he concluded the video with join us join joe the camps are still working out the details of engaging mr obama in fund raising but david plouffe who remains mr obama s most trusted political adviser has offered to pitch in and plans to participate in several virtual biden fund raisers that could be a dry run for mr obama s participation according to people briefed on the plans mr biden s emergence as the democrats presumptive nominee relatively early in the political calendar is unwelcome news to mr trump his bluster notwithstanding several of the president s advisers said last thursday after trying to goad an anti biden revolt among sanders supporters the president suggested dark motives for mr obama s hesitancy in endorsing mr biden you know what i ll tell you it does amaze me that president obama hasn t supported sleepy joe mr trump said at a white house coronavirus briefing in between questions about his administration s response to the crisis it just hasn t happened when is it going to happen when is it going to happen why isn t he he knows something that you don t know that i think i know but you don t know so it ll be interesting that claim was trumpian misdirection mr obama timed his video to follow mr sanders s endorsement on monday but the biden obama relationship which deepened from a congenial partnership into a real friendship in 2015 when the president consoled mr biden during his son beau s illness and death is not without complications mr biden is grateful for mr obama s friendship but increasingly proud of his historic comeback when news reports surfaced that mr obama had called to congratulate mr biden on his victory in south carolina the candidate made it clear to his staff that while his connection to mr obama played a role in delivering african american voters mr obama had not lifted a finger on his behalf according to a senior democrat with knowledge of his remarks well maybe a pinkie last year mr obama consulted with mr biden s team on campaign strategy and he bucked up mr biden after his loss in the iowa caucuses in a private dinner last fall with members of the liberal democracy alliance mr obama offered thinly veiled criticism of mr sanders s revolutionary policies and opined that voters wanted change not to tear down the system mr obama is relieved that the democratic contest is over early but he had other plans for 2020 hoping to finish publish and promote his white house memoirs before the campaign kicked into high gear he had intended to engage publicly only after the convention now scheduled for august at the earliest in line with his fall barnstorming campaign on behalf of mrs clinton in 2016 and congressional candidates in 2018 he resisted calls by some democratic officials earlier this year to intervene on mr biden s behalf in the wake of mr sanders s victory in the nevada caucuses arguing that he did not want to thumb the scale for his friend nonetheless he was becoming more agitated by the state of the race as mr sanders surged and mr biden slumped by late february he was telling people in his orbit that he thought mr biden s campaign had an alarming lack of infrastructure and shared his doubts about mr biden s belief that he could win the nomination after losing iowa and new hampshire democratic officials say mr obama had no direct role in the campaign shake up that happened soon after but people with knowledge of the situation say he made it clear that he supported mr biden s decision to name a new campaign manager jennifer o malley dillon a former obama campaign field organizing specialist and to move another obama veteran the former white house communications director anita dunn into a more powerful role mr obama did not directly encourage mr sanders s rivals to endorse mr biden ahead of the decisive super tuesday primaries but he did tell pete buttigieg a moderate that he would never have more leverage than on the day that he was quitting the race and the former south bend mayor soon joined the avalanche of former candidates backing mr biden mr sanders who in 2016 accused the democratic establishment of conspiring to support mrs clinton took note of all these moves but he has made no such charges against mr obama in fact one of his campaign advisers speaking on the condition of anonymity in the wake of last month s string of sanders defeats said the senator was grateful for mr obama s neutrality throughout the campaign and mr sanders who has denied reports that he contemplated a primary challenge to mr obama in 2012 had made a point of reaching out to the former president several times in recent months to update him on the progress of his campaign before those conversations the two men had a polite but frosty relationship and some of their private exchanges over the years devolved into policy debates former aides said but mr obama saw mr sanders s overture as an opening to assume the peacemaker s role he believed himself best suited to play since leaving office mr obama has ruminated about what he could have done differently both as president and as a campaign surrogate for mrs clinton to stop mr trump s ascent and concluded that he needed to do more to repair the damage from party infighting his true north is winning back the white house period said valerie jarrett a close friend and adviser to the former president in a phone interview last month mr obama she added would have backed any nominee any of them with the same conviction mr sanders is much closer personally to mr biden despite their political differences but mr obama unlike mr biden remains a trusted figure to many sanders supporters so much so that his campaign released an ad that featured a patchwork of clips with mr obama lavishing praise on mr sanders in the end mr sanders concluded that negotiating a d tente through the former president would ease the blow of his withdrawal on his base whether mr obama s involvement will ultimately draw sanders voters to support mr biden s candidacy remains an open question and some supporters including mr sanders s own campaign press secretary say they won t in late march mr obama reached out to mr sanders the two men would talk at least three more times with the former president reassuring mr sanders that he had already accomplished much of what he had set out to do moving the party and mr biden substantially to the left according to two people with knowledge of their interactions but the people said he mostly listened to mr sanders who was in a reflective mood speaking candidly about his post campaign plans and feelings about the race the kind of conversation the two men had never had before mr sanders for his part is intent on protecting his open line of communication with the former president when asked for a readout during an interview on msnbc shortly after dropping out last week he replied they re private conversations waving a don t even ask me about it hand at the camera the interviewer chris hayes plowed ahead well can i ask about your conversations with vice president biden oh yes mr sanders answered with a laugh updated may 25 2020 advertisement
