advertisement supported by south korea has been a model of testing and tracing during the epidemic now it is for voting too by john delury mr delury is a historian of china and an expert on the korean peninsula seoul south korea the most important thing about this country s legislative elections this week is the fact that they happened at all they were the world s first nationwide vote of the coronavirus era and more than 29 million people 66 percent of the electorate the highest turnout in nearly three decades cast ballots to choose 300 new members for the national assembly each polling station was equipped with hand sanitizer and disposable gloves voters wearing masks and standing far apart had their temperatures checked at the entrances no one seemed to feel they had to choose between exercising their democratic rights and protecting their health as with widespread testing so too with record voter turnout south korea is again a beacon in dark times a model for how an open society can weather the storm of a pandemic who would have predicted this six weeks ago at the end of february south korea held the dubious distinction of having the highest number of covid 19 cases outside china along with italy and iran it was one of the first new hot spot countries and a harbinger that the epidemic that started in wuhan was on its way to becoming a global pandemic i returned to seoul with my family from an extended stay in vietnam just as the number of daily infections was starting to spike the airline we flew canceled all its flights to and from south korea not long after for a harrowing spell in late february and early march south korea felt like ground zero before the outbreak president moon jae in and his liberal coalition the democratic party were in the doldrums mr moon had to let go of a controversial new justice minister and pull back on unpopular structural reforms like a pledge to substantially increase the minimum wage economic growth was sluggish mr moon s signature foreign policy of peace and denuclearization diplomacy with north korea was stuck in gear paralyzed by the lack of progress in negotiations between kim jong un the north s leader and president trump the spike in coronavirus cases in late february amplified the voice of conservative critics who slammed the government s decision not to ban all chinese visitors people grumbled about how hard it was to buy face masks mr moon s approval ratings slipped as south korea a country of resilient pessimists braced for the worst how things have changed since then in terms of both public health and political fortunes south korea is steadily dropping in the rankings of countries worst hit by the pandemic once second only to china population about 1 4 billion south korea population 51 6 million is now recording fewer total cases than ireland population 4 9 million and fewer deaths than the state of colorado population 5 7 million at the center of its remarkable ability to flatten the coronavirus curve has been a government strategy of openness and responsiveness to the public in other words south korea has drawn on its strengths as a liberal society to address the public health crisis and this week its people doubled down on democracy by turning out in droves to re elect its leadership as is now well known to the world as early as late january public health officials greenlighted efforts by the private sector to build up capacity for widespread testing for the coronavirus in case the outbreak got worse less well known is how as those test results came in the korea centers for disease control and prevention and the ministry of public health and welfare made sure the information was passed on swiftly and systematically to those who needed it the general public for weeks my mobile phone buzzed throughout the day alerting me to any confirmed covid 19 cases in my neighborhood and delivered useful details like the time at which an infected person had gone to the grocery store contact tracing and public data sharing of the kind just beginning in hard hit states like massachusetts has been a standard feature of daily life here that transparency in turn has allowed the government to rely largely on containment measures that are voluntary social distancing here is the subject of a public health campaign not an order of the state there has been no lockdown not nationally and not even at the epicenter of the outbreak the southwestern city of daegu during the worst of the crisis this week s parliamentary elections were a referendum on mr moon s democratic approach to the covid 19 pandemic and south korean voters handed him a resounding victory the democratic party won in a landslide capturing along with its satellite party an estimated 180 seats and securing the largest majority in decades voters punished mr moon s critics with the leader of the conservative united future party losing his race to lee nak yon mr moon s former prime minister and a future contender for the presidency and immediately stepping down a rare bit of good news for conservatives was the win by the north korean diplomat turned defector thae yong ho mr moon now has wind in his sails as he enters his last two years in office for the foreseeable future his focus like that of every head of state across the planet will be pandemic management he will have to lead south korea into the next phase of finding a sustainable democratic approach to fighting covid 19 especially in economic terms further out as this crisis and its pressures abate mr moon can be expected to revive his dreams of making peace with north korea the ultimate measure by which history will judge the legacy of south korea s leader but for the rest of the world the significance of this election has little to do with its outcome what matters most is that tens of millions of citizens were able to exercise their democratic rights even in the age of
