advertisement supported by when confronted with racism toward anyone our instinct should be indignation not deflection by euny hong ms hong is a journalist and author mid february when the world was starting to go pear shaped i had to travel to an area where i d previously experienced anti asian sentiment so a few days before the trip i emailed my white hairdresser frantically i know this sounds crazy but can you can make me blonde i m traveling next week and i m worried about being mistaken for chinese and blamed for the coronavirus let s skip the ridiculousness of the idea for a second to focus on the important bit why had i worded my request so offensively i could have just said i was worried about xenophobia why was i throwing people of chinese descent under the bus it s like that old joke about the two people running away from a bear you don t have to outrun the bear you just have to outrun the other guy except in this case you don t have to deal with racism you just have to make people racist at someone else my panic was a humbling reminder that i should never be overly confident that i would do the right thing in the face of fear sure wanting to avoid racial profiling is a survival instinct but survival instincts are often amoral and if unchecked can easily turn ugly i ended up not dyeing my hair because a sudden allergy attack made it ill advised also it was stupid but i shared my anxiety with a half chinese american half white friend what if i get stopped at the airport for extra screening i asked she messaged carry around a copy of your books to prove you re korean two of the books i wrote have the word korean in the title she added i m serious i messaged lol dismissed her idea for about 10 minutes and then put copies of my books in my carry on bag what was my plan to run up to someone hurling epithets and say hey i think we can all agree this covid stuff is all china s fault but good news i m korean you know the ones who brought you bts so we re good right this impulse isn t exactly new even if the pandemic has brought out its most sinister form i ve been doing it since i was a child worse i was taught to do it when i was a kid in late 1970s suburban chicago anti chinese taunts were a daily occurrence it was a frequent topic at korean church the only place we clapped eyes on other koreans outside our own homes our parents and sunday school teachers told us that the correct response was i m not chinese i m korean this didn t even work it should be noted when i informed a mean kindergartner that i was korean he responded there is no such place none of us kids were proud of being korean american back then the grown ups tried to counter this shame by instilling ethnic pride but despite their good intentions they invited pride s ugly sibling implied permission to step on other people for an inarticulate child maybe i m not chinese isn t an especially meaningful retort but a grown woman should know better so what finally brought about my moment of self reckoning it was a t shirt last month a chinese american friend of mine posted on social media about a targeted internet ad that had outraged her in the wake of covid 19 some clothing vendor saw a business opportunity a series of t shirts with slogans like i m asian but i m not chinese i m not chinese i m korean i m not chinese i m malaysian etc her friends comments under her post were equally indignant so much for predictive algorithms by the way my first thought was i wish we d had these shirts when i was a kid and then i stopped myself horrified by way of context not justification asians have been siccing people on other asians for ages in world war ii era america some asian owned businesses posted signs in their windows specifying that they were not japanese i have even met a few asians of that generation who currently believe that it made political sense for franklin d roosevelt to put japanese americans in internment camps just the japanese which is not to say that mislabeling isn t dangerous it can even be deadly in highland park mich in 1982 there was an incident that all asian americans of a certain age remember vividly a chinese american named vincent chin was murdered in a strip club by two white autoworkers who assumed he was japanese one of the people who they believed had destroyed the american auto industry it was a tragic case of mistaken identity but to respond to that horrific incident with vincent chin wasn t even japanese is to create a dangerous distraction from the core issue it is never ok to attack anyone based on their race for as long as i can remember i ve bristled at the asian american label i found it frustratingly meaningless lumping together diverse groups under one heading in a way that promoted precisely the kind of generalizations we want to prevent you all look the same or i bet you love excel and bad driving but what i ve come to realize over the past few weeks is that even if i don t identify with that designation and find it overly broad like it or not it shapes how people see me the only path forward for any of us requires a united front if someone says you chinese are killing us i am in that moment chinese whether i give the other person a piece of my mind or not awkward perhaps from six feet away my instinct should be indignation not deflection because one of many lessons i ve learned from the pandemic and its consequences is that focusing on being misidentified by a xenophobe is nothing better than trying to negotiate a more accurate insult euny hong euny is
