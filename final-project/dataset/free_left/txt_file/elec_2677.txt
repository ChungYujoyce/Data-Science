accepted the challenge by politico magazine september 17 2015 if you want to stump a democrat ask them to name an accomplishment of hillary clinton carly fiorina quipped at wednesday s republican debate the line got hearty applause but it also cut to the core of one of the defining lines of attacks against the former first lady and democratic presidential frontrunner after nearly forty years in public life what exactly has she accomplished it s a question that even at times has tripped up clinton herself during her 2014 book tour when abc s diane sawyer asked her about her marquee achievement clinton changed the subject and she fumbled over a similar question during a women s forum in manhattan last year i see my role as secretary in fact leadership in general in a democracy as a relay race you run the best race you can run you hand off the baton some of what hasn t been finished may go on to be finished she told thomas friedman i m very proud of the economic stabilization and the really solid leadership that the administration provided that i think now leads us to be able to deal with problems like ukraine because we re not so worried about a massive collapse in europe advertisement the question fiorina posed has also tripped up members of the obama administration when state department spokesperson jen psaki was asked last year to identify one tangible achievement accomplished through one of hillary clinton s key projects as secretary of state the first ever audit of the department psaki punted i am certain that those who were here at the time who worked hard on that effort could point out one hillary s supporters have been stumped too when bloomberg politics mark halperin asked a focus group of iowans this summer about hillary clinton s accomplishments one democratic supporter said i honestly can t say i followed along with everything that was going on so is fiorina right are democrats really unable to defend clinton s record on the merits to find out politico magazine on thursday asked the nation s top democratic leaders and thinkers to name hillary clinton s biggest accomplishment what is the most impressive item on clinton s record which legislative or policy triumph from her many years in office will be most important on the campaign trail not surprisingly those surveyed all came up with an answer to defend their party s likely presidential nominee whether these count as marquee significant or tangible you be the judge it s kind of hard to pick one accomplishment by bill burton former senior strategist for priorities usa action a super pac in support of president barack obama it s kind of hard to pick one accomplishment for hillary clinton personally i m sure she d say her daughter and grandchild are her greatest accomplishments professionally how about these three 1 her china speech on women 2 her role in killing osama bin laden 3 management of the state department during which time we saw a 50 percent increase in exports to china aggressive work on climate particularly at copenhagen and the effort to create and implement the toughest sanctions ever on iran helping to lead us to the agreement currently on the table the sanction on iran that brought them to the table howard dean is the former governor of vermont and the former chair of the democratic national committee hillary clinton was the principal author of the sanction on iran that brought them to the table we cannot afford any know nothings like carly in the white house nearly every foreign policy victory of president obama s second term has secretary clinton s fingerprints on it by harry reid senate democratic leader american foreign policy was stronger when hillary clinton left the state department than when she arrived she took the reins from a bush administration that had left america s reputation deeply damaged and planted the seeds for the foreign policy successes we see today from the agreement to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon to the landmark normalization of relations with cuba nearly every foreign policy victory of president obama s second term has secretary clinton s fingerprints on it her accomplishments extend to health care as well as first lady she helped create and guide through congress children s health insurance program a key program that brought health care coverage to millions of children as a senator she worked across the aisle to provide full military health benefits to reservists and national guard members secretary clinton was also an outspoken champion for women around the world she set records for travel while leading the state department and used every trip to empower the women of the 112 countries she visited she made gender equality a priority of u s foreign policy and she created the ambassador at large for global women s issues a post charged with integrating gender throughout the state department the schip program which expanded health coverage to millions of lower income children by anita dunn democratic political strategist after universal health care failed in 1994 the clinton administration was reluctant to go anywhere near healthcare again democrats lost the senate and the house in 1994 and losing the house was for the first time in 40 years then first lady hilary clinton ended up being the white house ally and inside player who worked with ted kennedy and orrin hatch to create the schip program in clinton s second term which expanded health coverage to millions of lower income children she has other accomplishments but this one made a huge difference and came at a time when politically the administration was cutting deals with newt gingrich on the budget and not necessarily all that enthusiastic about revisiting health care this obviously isn t her only accomplishment but it is meaningful because she took a political battering after the failure in 1994 but came back to fight again and was able to work on a bipartisan basis during a very polarized time to get this done seems relevant clinton is one of the most accomplished people ever to run by chuck schumer u s senator for new york democratic party hillary clinton is one of the most accomplished people ever to run for the presidency i m lucky enough to have seen those accomplishments up close from her time as senator from new york and as secretary of state hillary clinton was instrumental in helping secure 21 billion in federal aid to help new york rebuild after 9 11 she fought tooth and nail to protect the first responders who rushed into danger when the towers collapsed and was pivotal in the passage of legislation that helped those first responders who got sick get the care and treatment they deserved she worked night and day to protect and create jobs in new york whether that was at the niagara falls air force base or the center for bioinformatics at the university of buffalo she also led the charge on the lilly ledbetter pay equity act which is now the law of the land 2016 by elizabeth f ralph 2016 by rick wilson 2016 as secretary of state secretary clinton was not only inspirational figure for billions of women around the globe she also did much to restore the shattered credibility of the united states which had lost so much influence following the failed foreign policies of the previous administration she negotiated the cease fire in gaza that stopped the hamas from firing rocket after rocket into israel she helped secure the start treaty s ratification and has advanced women s rights in countries around the globe that s just a snapshot of what hillary clinton has accomplished over a lifetime of public service to new york and the country if you really want to stump a democrat you should ask them which of hillary s accomplishments is your favorite there are too many to choose from rebuilding america s leadership and prestige overseas after the bush years bill richardson is a former secretary of energy and governor of new mexico as secretary of state hillary clinton was key in rebuilding america s leadership and prestige overseas after the bush years she restored our alliances with the eu and key asian allies as well as key relationships in africa and latin america the pediatric research equity act by chris dodd former u s senator for connecticut democratic party having worked with her in the senate and on the help committee the first thing that came to mind was her authorship of the pediatric research equity act this law requires drug companies to study their products in children the act is responsible for changing the drug labeling of hundreds of drugs with important information about safety and dosing of drugs for children it has improved the health of millions of children who take medications to treat diseases ranging from hiv to epilepsy to asthma millions of kids are in better shape and alive because of the law senator clinton authored crippling sanctions against iran by paul begala political analyst for cnn and counselor to president bill clinton easy iran sanctions sec clinton accomplished the nearly impossible mission of getting china russia the european union and the civilized world on board with crippling sanctions against iran this is what brought iran to the negotiating table ms fiorina may not see that as an accomplishment since while she was ceo of hewlett packard the firm sold hundreds of millions of dollars of computer products the the terrorist regime in tehran evading us sanctions clinton struck major and consequential diplomatic achievements by bill scher senior writer at the campaign for america s future hillary clinton has four major accomplishments from her tenure as secretary of state winning the un resolution supporting military intervention in libya the new start arms control treaty with russia renewing diplomatic ties with myanmar and setting in the motion talks that culminated in the iran nuclear deal we don t see the clinton campaign or other democrats leap to cite most of these accomplishments because they come with degrees of future uncertainty and in the case of libya associations with the tangentially related benghazi attack but they are significant accomplishments nonetheless clinton is often mocked for failing to reset relations with russia but the new start treaty is being followed and helping contain tensions she won russia s support for un sanctions on iran that helping bring the rogue state to the negotiating table and she cajoled russia to abstain on the libyan resolution which was critical to securing its passage in the un security council in fact she may have reset too well vladimir putin who was not president at the time opposed the resolution and that may have contributed to his decision to reclaim his post the aftermath of that libyan intervention has been messy with rival governments fracturing the country although unity talks are currently taking place myanmar has not been perfect either the promise of released political prisoners has only been partially filled and the military is being accused of manipulating the upcoming general election still the participation of the previously banned national league for democracy party is a step forward these are reminders that in the real world progress is often halting but the fact remains that clinton struck major and consequential diplomatic achievements even if the final historical judgment on their lasting impact is years away i ve seen first hand her exceptional work at every level by patrick leahy u s senator for vermont democratic party i ve seen first hand her exceptional work at every level when she was in the white house as first lady later when we were partners and neighbors as senators and after that when she was secretary of state just one example which is one of her enduring legacies as first lady was her partnership with congress in developing the children s health insurance program chip which has improved access to essential health care for millions of kids in the senate we worked together on efforts to clean up lake champlain and to help vermont s and new york s family farmers she was at the center of securing help for new york s 9 11 first responders we worked together in enacting the lilly ledbetter fair pay act which was the first bill signed into law by president obama i was chairman of the state department s budget committee when she was secretary of state and i worked closely with her week to week and sometimes day to day on a wide wide range of issues and challenges from human rights to global health we traveled together to haiti as we worked to help that country recover from the devastation of the earthquake she had a leading role in securing tougher sanctions on iran we worked together to successfully overcome obstruction by house republicans of the funding she requested to improve embassy security around the world some of her most important achievements were her steady methodical efforts with the president to help reintroduce america to the world after the diplomatic setbacks under the previous administration she was the point person compelling the chinese to commit to cutting carbon emissions by david axelrod former senior advisor to president barack obama when i was there she played a very active role in rallying the world behind the global sanctions against iran that brought them to the table over their nuclear program she was the point person in copenhagen in compelling the chinese to commit to cutting carbon emissions she personally negotiated a ceasefire between israel and hamas those are a few that come to mind the adoption and safe families act by neera tanden president of the center for american progress as first lady hillary was the point person in the clinton administration on the adoption and safe families act of 1997 a bill that refocused adoption policies on the needs of the children made it easier to remove children from abusive situations provided support and services to adoptive families and encouraged adoption of children with special needs the bill increased foster adoptions by 64 percent by 2002 hillary helped develop the idea behind this bill first writing about it in a 1995 article she went on to work with republicans and democrats in congress including moderate rhode island republican john chafee to see the bill through to final passage helping broker compromises to ensure the bill s passage this was not a big bill that dominated headlines but for every child who was placed in a loving home because of this legislation hillary s work was more than an accomplishment on a resume it was an important part of the reason their lives were better clinton has at every turn fought for progress and opportunity by tracy sefl former senior advisor to ready for hillary willful ignorance that is what fuels this republican talking point the scope and significance of hillary clinton s work far exceeds a cable ready soundbite so perhaps in that regard republicans find it easier to resort to an untruth after all as we all saw wednesday night at the reagan library these are the science deniers the reality is that hillary clinton has at every turn fought for progress and opportunity as her campaign continues she ll continue to share exactly what those fights have entailed and for who domestically on behalf of children veterans active military first responders victims of gender based violence family caregivers pregnant women as secretary of state she helped restore america s standing during challenging times meaning that her tireless diplomatic efforts brought forth progress with tougher sanctions missile reduction treaties ceasefires and strengthened international coalitions and critically her core belief that the improved lives of women and girls worldwide will leads to stronger and safer economies is proving to be transformational in the 21st century if this is what republicans are leaning on as their key argument against hillary clinton they are insulting the intelligence of the electorate argue with her about her record it s clear she d welcome that but don t deny its existence the new start treaty by hilary rosen a democratic strategist hillary clinton as secretary of state led the negotiations that led to the new start treaty a landmark revision of our nuclear arms agreement with russia it received bipartisan support in congress and represents a critical leg in our national security and a safer world carly fiorina said in the debate that she would dump that treaty to show her strength to putin that isn t showing strength that is just a dumb way to threaten global nuclear war a relentless advocate for women and children by douglas schoen pollster for president bill clinton hillary clinton has been a relentless advocate for women and children throughout her long career in public office she has championed women s reproductive rights as well as establishing the importance of early education clinton played a critical role in the creation of the adoption and safe families act furthermore as an equal pay proponent clinton introduced the paycheck fairness act as well as the lilly ledbetter fair pay act on the campaign trail in 2015 she has stayed true to her staunch belief in gender equality especially in the workplace by championing a raise in the minimum wage as well as supporting policies like paid sick leave and maternity leave going forward clinton needs to continue to emphasize these cornerstone issues for her as well as focus on economic growth we can t know what a hillary clinton presidency will look like without hearing clearly and explicitly how she will create jobs foster and protect innovation and support the entrepreneurs that drive our economy galvanizing the senate after the tragedy of 9 11 by barbara boxer u s senator for california democratic party carly fiorina wishes she had accomplished in a lifetime what hillary clinton has accomplished in any given year from leading efforts to impose the toughest iran sanctions in history to making women s rights central to our foreign policy to galvanizing the senate after the tragedy of 9 11 to rebuild the city and take care of our brave first responders a smart power diplomacy by harold koh former legal adviser of the department of state as secretary hillary clinton defined and tried consistently to implement a smart power diplomacy that combines diplomacy development aid rule of law and private initiatives with limited applications of hard power to project u s global leadership abroad in an age where our hard power resources are limited and near exhaustion her approach is a much more promising than the republicans to addressing our hardest global problems in the years ahead the iran nuclear deal the multilateral trade talks and the climate change negotiations are only three current concrete examples of that approach in action she helped hold together the presidency and the country by dennis kucinich former u s representative from ohio when the clinton administration was under attack and facing impeachment hillary clinton slowed great courage fortitude and perseverance she helped hold together the presidency and the country by virtue of her steadfastness and determination her conduct revealed an extraordinary resilience and grace under pressure which are the hallmarks of a strong leader even more than her considerable work on health and education her effort to be a unifying force at that time was important for america the world is safer and people are more free thanks to hillary clinton by donna brazile democratic strategist and contributor to cnn and abc news republican attacks on hillary clinton s record are laughable and i m old enough to remember when carly fiorina praised hillary for having devoted her life to public service and pointed out that she s an inspiration for many women as secretary of state hillary clinton was instrumental in building an international coalition around the toughest regime of sanctions against iran in history on the world stage she is an unmatched leader she went to beijing 20 years ago and declared that women s rights are human rights more recently she stood before representatives of nations like russia and uganda and stated boldly that gay rights are human rights too today the world is safer and people are more free thanks to hillary clinton here at home from her very first job out of law school at the children s defense fund hillary clinton has delivered results for americans most at risk of discrimination and restricted opportunity as first lady she championed healthcare reform at the comprehensive level and through schip for children living in poverty in the senate she fought to raise the minimum wage she stood up for 9 11 first responders and she was a tireless advocate for legislation to protect and expand the right to vote fiorina may disagree with clinton on the issues but she is wrong to dismiss the record of a woman who made progress possible here in this country and around the world i have to call bs on this exercise by ed kilgore liberal commentator blogger at washington monthly s political animal and managing editor at the democratic strategist i m sorry i have to call bs on this exercise if only because it is emanating from carly fiorina whose public policy accomplishments are exactly zero if say hrc had as i think it s clear she did a formative effect on the long effort towards universal health coverage it s vastly more influence than fiorina has ever had on public policy california by jeremy b white updated 05 08 20 09 44 pm edt by sam sutton and carly sitrin by bill mahoney and josh
