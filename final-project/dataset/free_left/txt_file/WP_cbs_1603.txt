the following is a transcript of an interview with ambassador cui tiankai that aired sunday february 9 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we want to take a closer look at efforts to contain the now over 37 000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in china where the death toll stands at at least 811 joining us to talk more about the virus is china s ambassador to the u s welcome to face the nation ambassador cui ambassador cui tiankai thank you margaret brennan our condolences ambassador cui thank you very much margaret brennan for these hundreds of fatalities ambassador cui yeah margaret brennan why hasn t the virus been contained ambassador cui well you see this is a new virus so virtually very few people knew anything about it at the beginning that s how people are still learning to discover more about the virus and how it affects people and the channels of infections and trying their best to stop it margaret brennan the u s has offered repeatedly ambassador cui yeah margaret brennan to send cdc experts american experts to help out why does beijing continue to ignore those offers ambassador cui i don t think it s been ignored first of all margaret brennan well you haven t said yes ambassador cui well we we welcome the american expert to participate in our efforts and we are coordinating with the world health organization because a lot of things are done under the auspices of the world health organization we certainly welcome american experts to join the actual group that the w h o the assembly and i m sure there will be going to china very soon margaret brennan you expect americans to be there as part of the w h o but you don t want the cdc there ambassador cui first of all america experts are on the list recommended by the w h o we certainly respect i think all of us respect the w h o as the most professional intergovernmental body in the world and for the u s cdc they have very frequent regular contact with the their chinese counterparts the chinese cdc and even beyond that some american experts have come to china already on their own individual basis so there s ongoing contacts not only between the two governments but also between the two cdc s and between the academic institutions and even some american companies are also offering help technical help margaret brennan well i i asked the question because it also gets at there s a lot of unknown and a lot of suspicion because of that and in fact this week senator tom cotton who sits on the senate intelligence and armed services committee suggested that the virus may have come from china s biological warfare program that s an extraordinary charge how do you respond to that ambassador cui i think it s true that a lot is still unknown and our scientists chinese scientists american scientists scientists of other countries are doing their best to learn more about the virus but it s very harmful it s very dangerous to stir up suspicion rumors and spread them among the people for one thing this will create panic another thing that it will fend up racial discrimination xenophobia all these things that will really harm our joint efforts to combat the virus of course there are all kinds of speculation and rumors there are people who are saying that these virus are coming from some some military lab not of china maybe in the united states how how can we believe all these crazy things margaret brennan you think it s crazy where did the virus come from ambassador cui absolutely crazy margaret brennan where did the virus come from ambassador cui we still don t know yet it s probably according to some initial outcome of the research probably coming from some animals but we have to to discover more about it margaret brennan there has been some outcry on social media particularly after the death of dr li wenliang he had made public warnings for weeks before the government acknowledged this was happening in fact authorities had forced him to disavow what he had said previously which turned out to be true the communist party of china is now investigating this why ambassador cui well we are all very saddened about the death of dr li he is a good doctor he was a devoted doctor and he did his best to protect people s health we are so grateful to him but you see he was a doctor and a doctor could be alarmed by some individual cases but as for the government you have to do more you have to base your decisions your announcement on more solid evidence and signs margaret brennan but do you think silencing him in the beginning was a mistake ambassador cui i i don t know who tried to silence him but there was certainly a disagreement or people were not able to reach agreement on what exactly the virus is how it is affecting people so there was a process of trying to discover more to learn more about the virus maybe some people reacted not quickly enough maybe dr li he perceived some incoming dangers earlier than others but this is this could happen anywhere but whenever we find there s some shortcoming margaret brennan yeah ambassador cui we ll do our best to correct it margaret brennan have chinese authorities detained the citizen journalist chen qiushi he has disappeared and his videos revealed a lot of what was happening with this virus ambassador cui i m sorry i have not never heard of this guy so i don t have any information to share with you margaret brennan his videos are how the rest of the world has seen some of the images of what s happening i want to also ask you quickly secretary of state mike pompeo gave an extraordinary speech yesterday to a a number of governors from all around the united states and he harshly criticized the chinese communist party and he said that your country is targeting states cities schools academic institutions to try to figure out how to exploit them what exactly is the intention of the chinese government because the secretary of state says it s not good ambassador cui i always believe the real foundation of china u s relations is the friendship and mutual understanding between our peoples so this is the root of state to state relations and there s such an infusion among american states cities and towns and ordinary americans to learn more about china to develop friendship with chinese people to facilitate cooperation between our two countries margaret brennan well he he s ambassador cui i don t i don t think anybody has any reason to guess the will of the people margaret brennan well he specifically referenced concentration camps in xinjiang he talked about american institutions and inadvertently investing in surveillance of muslim minorities do you want to respond to that point ambassador cui that s totally wrong that s totally wrong because the core issue in xinjiang is how to combat terrorism you see some years ago until most recently people in xinjiang were victims to rising terrorist terrorist attacks there were thousands of such attacks hurting and even killing hundreds of thousands of people so we have to do something to stop this threat to the very well being and the lives of the people there margaret brennan ok ambassador cui so without tremendous efforts now for the last three years margaret brennan yeah ambassador cui there has been no such terrorist attack so people have a much better safety there security there and people are happy there margaret brennan all right ambassador thank you for telling your side of the story we will be right back with new numbers from
