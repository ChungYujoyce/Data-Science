advertisement supported by by maggie haberman and patrick healy first he compared ben carson to a child molester in a nationally televised interview then at a campaign rally in iowa donald j trump asked for someone to come try to stab him in the abdomen twisting his own belt buckle as if to prove that mr carson s account of having knifed a friend as a wild tempered youth had to have been a lie in the same speech a 95 minute rant in fort dodge on thursday night that left his listeners stunned into silence mr trump managed to insult a good portion of the electorate in iowa where republicans will cast their ballots in 79 days by saying voters there would be stupid to believe in mr carson by friday afternoon when he posted a video mocking mr carson as either a would be killer or a pathological liar the more pressing question seemed to concern mr trump s candidacy and whether he will ever be able to convert it from a personality driven crowd attraction into a persuasive case for the presidency that can draw a bigger plurality of republican primary voters the front runner all summer mr trump has struggled to consistently crack through a ceiling in the iowa polls of about 30 percent in large part because of fierce recent competition from mr carson the mild mannered retired neurosurgeon who has won a following with evangelical voters with his story of spiritual redemption but now some republicans believe that his scathing attacks on mr carson and voters who support him will backfire it raises the possibility that mr trump s seemingly sturdy floor of support in those polls could begin to give way especially if more republicans turn to more sober minded candidates with military and national security experience following the terrorist attacks in paris how stupid are the people of iowa how stupid are the people of the country mr trump said thursday night of voters who believe mr carson s story don t be fooled he said of mr carson s story of his decades old religious awakening dave carney a republican political strategist who ran rick perry s presidential race in 2012 speculated that the remarks could be deeply damaging he s walking on a tightrope mr carney said of mr trump he loves the applause of the crowd 100 stories down but when you start to make fun of being born again and redemption and christian faith in our party you can talk yourself right off the tightrope history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling mr carson who came under scrutiny last week over whether he had embellished details of his background including his story of having assaulted someone with a knife declined to be baited into a fight on friday sidestepping what he called mr trump s gratuitous attack but saying he would not participate in the politics of personal destruction but one republican contender who has tangled with mr trump carly fiorina rose to mr carson s defense all the money in the world won t make you as smart as ben carson mrs fiorina wrote in a post on facebook mr trump has survived even thrived after the sort of verbal recklessness that would have doomed other candidates his characterization of mexican illegal immigrants as rapists and drug dealers his denigration of senator john mccain s years as a prisoner of war in vietnam and his derogatory comments about mrs fiorina as well as megyn kelly of fox news and other women but some republicans said that mr trump s 24 hour spree of over the top effrontery could at last signal his eventual derailment given that it exacerbated long held questions about his temperament and unstatesmanlike style trump s attacks on carson could be the hole in the dike said edward rollins a veteran republican consultant referring to mr trump s core of supporters many republicans didn t like mccain it was also early in the campaign and many were viewing trump as a protest candidate now he is viewed as a front runner and potential nominee to attack carson yesterday as viciously as he did may make voters take a second look several pollsters said mr trump s remarks had created the most potentially damaging moment of his campaign but they were unsure how many die hard trump supporters would stick with him no matter what he says trump has had what looks like a hard floor of support in iowa at least 20 percent but a hard floor one day may not be a hard floor a week later if the candidate has not created a bond with voters through advertising as well as speeches and debate performances said peter a brown assistant director of the quinnipiac university poll this is perhaps the strongest language that trump has used to date and we ll soon see if voters accept it ed goeas a longtime republican pollster said the biggest problem for mr trump may be the use of the word stupid voters may forgive many things like insulting mexicans and mr mccain he said but they do not like being called dumb that s not the way to endear himself to iowans the very voters who he is trying to pull away from carson with these attacks said mr goeas who previously advised a former republican presidential candidate gov scott walker of wisconsin for the first time in this campaign i feel like this might be the moment that trump needs to apologize for something matt moore chairman of the south carolina republican party which holds the first primary in the south in mid february said mr trump risked turning off evangelical and conservative voters by attacking mr carson who enjoys wide respect from them it will be impossible to win the republican nomination much less the white house by slashing and burning down the field mr moore said politics is addition and multiplication not division and subtraction it s simple math for that math to work in mr trump s favor he needs to start spending money to build a serious political operation in multiple states republicans said as well as on political advertising so voters can see different facets of him candidates do not win by simply trusting that voters will read about their speeches on social media or in newspapers or catch snippets of their remarks on television republicans said such connections are impersonal and less effective than broadcasting positive commercials and meeting voters at scores of small scale events where they can get a feel for candidates that is the decision mr trump faces how to grow a candidacy that has been nurtured on bombast but deprived of spending his aides continue to promise that he will soon buy television ads but none have materialized still john mclaughlin a republican pollster who briefly advised mr trump in 2012 when he considered a presidential run said mr trump remained the best vessel for voters who are deeply frustrated with politics he can say these things and get away with it because the race really isn t about him but about voter anger at washington and president obama and also at republicans who can t get things done mr mclaughlin said trump is acting from his gut with these attacks mr mclaughlin added and his instincts have served him well so far his gut is he needs to take carson on advertisement
