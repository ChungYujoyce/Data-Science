in this extended transcript of correspondent tracy smith s interview with john williams for cbs sunday morning conducted at tanglewood the summer performance home of the boston symphony and the boston pops the composer talks about his partnership with director steven spielberg a collaboration unparalleled in film he also discusses the all consuming nature of writing music working on star wars and why he doesn t watch his films once they re done tracy smith so you conducted the boston pops for more than a decade do you feel coming to tanglewood like you re home john williams oh tanglewood is definitely my home and it s many ways spiritual and musical and otherwise your viewers will probably know it s a summer home of the boston symphony but tanglewood is also the home of norman rockwell so if you re familiar with the four freedoms and the atmosphere of all of that they will understand that that atmosphere is still preserved here and the history of it spiritually and artistically is very deep i speak about tanglewood with such affection and love maybe more than you want to hear but i will remind your viewers that daniel chester french who did the lincoln memorial statue did it here and you can go to his studio and see the models of lincoln that he made there and then people don t know where that statue came from well it came from the berkshires from tanglewood actually smith how does it feel for you what does it do you to your soul to come back here williams well i really believe that it s a spooky place the hills of the berkshires attracted spiritual groups like the shakers and artists melville and hawthorne and edith wharton and aaron copeland leonard bernstein the reason that they all came here to work is that it really is an inspiring place the trees are always inspiring to us everywhere you go but this is something very very spiritual and special and i think for musicians particularly and writers also the palate of what we do is silence you know you can get in among the trees if you like and listen to the trees and the breeze and the place to ruminate is unequaled in this kind of thing so this place is a big part of american cultural history a much bigger place than most people are aware of smith that s true williams there s so much history here and just to answer your question its effect on me is very spiritual and very exciting and i ve written so much music here so many film scores in this place smith here williams right here i come every summer smith can you drop some names the scores that you wrote here williams star wars films indiana jones and schindler s list and harry potter and all of this work a great percentage of that work done physically here because it s such a happy place to be i discovered this place in 1980 while conducting the boston pops so i ve now been coming here for 39 years every summer happily conducting the orchestra briefly each year and it s a big part of my life and the perfect antidote to the hollywood activities that i do the rest of the year listen to audio excerpts from some of john williams best scores photos audio samples of some of the most memorable music by the composer of jaws star wars and other unforgettable films smith that s true very different williams completely different in every possible way but it s also very exciting because the one thing is the re invigoration of the other so it keeps me maybe not young but hopefully a little fresh laughs smith you are still very fresh and i don t mean that in the pejorative sense williams yeah smith so you talk about the kind of solitude that you feel here your process is you re very isolated almost monk like williams it is yeah composing music i m very unreconstructed tracy you know when i was studying music they didn t have computers and all the synthesizers and so on sound substitutes and the rest of it so i learned to write with a pencil and paper which are still usable tools but only sort of monk ish elderly very few of my younger colleagues work that way but i ve been so busy in my working life that i never had time really to retool so i still do it in this what is to younger people a very primitive way of writing music note by note and i haven t changed so i am slower than my younger colleagues i must have to admit smith but it works laugh williams well i hope it works you know it s what i know and what i m used to and i think probably the great music when we think about bach for example he must have been using a quill pen or something i think if you write a letter with a pen you think one way a paper for school or whatever and if you do it this way it isn t the same process and so it s kind of like making home dough you know the same you have an eraser and go back and correct what you did in the morning and so on smith how all consuming is your work when you are composing williams well anybody that writes knows that thinking about what you re writing is a 24 7 thing you get in bed at night and you think ah that should be this tune or that should be a different key or whatever it shouldn t be an oboe it ought to be a flute now that s at 1 00 in the morning you know and it s very hard maybe to decompartmentalize these kind of activities for people who do what i do one thing i would say about it is that it s a great privilege to be able to work the way i work but it is so intense that you neglect things smith like williams you can neglect people you can neglect family i have wonderful children my late wife is gone but my present wife is very happy but it does so consume your life this work which it really shouldn t a lot of the work that i do is certainly not that important but the process of doing it is so all consuming just suggest the word you used that is the truth of it it s isn t a sometimes thing it s a full time thing at least with me and i think most others who do similar work and also like a journalist probably in your world you write a paper one day on a wednesday and it s published the next day and the following wednesday you look at it and you think my god i could have improved my prose if i had another two hours to work this and i think it s also true in the film music world when i score paper and give it to a librarian i know it s not coming back to me the next time i ll see it is on the stage with the orchestra so like journalism there s little time for second and third thoughts and rewrites the beautiful thing of working with an artist like anne sophie mutter is that when we created these adaptations of my tunes we did a lot of back and forth and i could do rewrites and drive her crazy with changes laughs and she would learn one thing and i d fortunately i only imagined how much trouble i must have caused her laughs but she rose to every occasion smith do you listen to the film scores once they re in the movies once they re out there williams no no smith no why not williams cause i m writing music all the time tracy and therefore it s no comfort to listen to it i don t listen to music very much smith at all williams if you go to a dinner party which i do rarely and somebody has music on i m thinking well that s in d major and oh my god the f sharp is flat and meanwhile halfway through whatever we re eating it s hard not to listen to it if you ve been trained in not only conducting but also editing so much music where you re listening to minutia in every take and editing you know and now digitally of course i m overstating the matter i m sure and exaggerating it a little bit to make the point but if i listen to great classical composers i would only think that s much better than anything i could write it isn t comforting laughs smith it s not inspiring williams laughs no smith it s not comforting williams no it does make me think that one can always be better cause the greatest writing of music has been this development out of church music into bach and finally haydn mozart beethoven and so on the art of arranging notes and tones has never reached a higher point than that that was the apex probably of tonal organization we ve since gone to some aspects of total dis organization very exciting and the way to go but we have still always the great masters to look at without envy and the greatest admiration ever possible at least in my case smith so you don t listen to music that much recreationally you don t go to movies williams i don t go to movies no smith you haven t seen a lot of the movies that your music is in williams not after we dub them tracy i ve seen them 50 times smith and that s enough laughter williams and so it s enough you know and at a dubbing session you know at the end of the scoring which is like three or four weeks or maybe more of intensive doing it every day sitting in the theater fixing levels and so on and making changes and i will go to a premiere always to see how well we ve done but there s always an issue there because every theater will give you a different playback image we ve got at fox studios or disney is supposed to be the perfect sound representation for the perfect theatre there s rarely a perfect theater so you don t wanna overreact to what you hear there isn t enough bass and you put more in now there s too much in the next theater eventually you can go a little crazy doing that so the best thing to do is do the best work you can and let it fly and let it float and go on to the next thing so ergo i don t go to the movies i don t listen to what i ve written i will listen to what i ve written with anne sophie but i haven t done since we have done the editing and i will wait and listen later and i will listen better or more objectively i m sure smith if you give it some space williams yes smith this is the last star wars you re doing is that true williams yes it is smith why is that you feel that this is the right time williams well certainly i think it s the end of the skywalker story as far as i understand it disney which is the company that owns lucasfilm may want to go on and produce more lucas inspired films but this will put the bow on the package for me and it ll probably be the end of a sort of thematic flow which started on the first movie and ended now what s wild for me as a composer of star wars is this has never happened it s my good fortune the good fortune in the sense that i did the music for the first film it was this that and the other theme in the second film i had this that and the other theme and two more themes and so the glossary of things has expanded over all these years we couldn t play it all in one night there s too much of it smith after the first film you didn t know there was going to be a second film williams no smith and you also didn t know the relationship between luke and leia williams no i didn t well the first film george lucas didn t give us any indication there would be a second film and i don t think he knew himself cause he wrote the script on a yellow pencil pad as he did with all the subsequent ones and i know that he didn t think the film was gonna be that successful because he told his friend steven spielberg oh no this is not gonna work and so on steven said no it s great it ll be playing for months and it played for years after surprised everybody but the story i tell about luke and leia i saw them as two young people in the first film that i would never see again and they seemed to be compatible they had fun together they did the action scenes together and i figured well sooner or later they will be lovers and they ll have children and you know so i wrote a love theme for princess leia not knowing for like two or three years that they were brother and sister i m not even sure when george laughs told us that was the second film or the third return of the jedi so i had to go back and write different themes for laughs the various relationships that came into focus over time princess leia s theme from star wars a music only scene from the last jedi featuring luke mark hamill and leia carrie fisher with a reprise of luke and leia s theme from return of the jedi smith what do you think it is about that collaboration with steven why do the two of you work so well together williams i don t know steven and i have been working together since 73 that must be like 45 years smith that s remarkable williams he s an amazing person as probably most people know by now he s a great movie director and a great producer but also a great philanthropist in the major ways that are not publicized when i met him he was about 23 or 24 years old and studio executives asked if we would have lunch and i went to the restaurant to meet him and it was a fancy restaurant in beverly hills and i the maitre d took me over to the table and here was this skinny kid that looked about 17 and i thought my this is the director that they sent me to see and i sat down with him we began to talk and i realized in a minute that he was brilliant he knew more about film music he could recall themes that i had written from films that i had forgotten and others from older colleagues that i had forgotten and it turned out to be an amiable general in his management of photography and editing and set building and everything else he seemed to have as a kid this mastery of his art and again very like anne sophie who was a wunderkind when she was a baby steven has a similar quality and also he hasn t changed it s the same to me little very young man who was very sweet and not naive and i ve also seen him in meetings with business people and so on when he was a grownup adult and masterful in his dealings with people forty plus years of working together we ve never had an argument smith never williams and he said something that s very interesting as a director and a producer he comes to my office and i play things for him on the piano in all these years he s never said i don t like that it s not you know try something else by the time i get halfway through i can see from his face muscles where i am with this thing and he s enthusiastic about everything even the things that we reject sometimes i ll do a scene with the orchestra and i frequently write two versions and i know exactly which one he s gonna take but it s part of the process that i need to go through to get somewhere between his thinking and mine that will meet i think one other thing that i would mention why the relationship with spielberg is so lasting he loves music so many producers will go on the stage we have a 90 piece orchestra sitting there it s very expensive and they will worry when are we gonna finish let them go it s more expensive if we go into overtime and people understand this and at the end of our session steven will come to me have you got any more play some more don t let them go it s an almost physical joy the first recording session of jaws steven brought his mother to the recording session and the man who was the former concertmaster the lead violinist of the philadelphia orchestra was our lead violinist on the session a great violinist and steven said to his mother oh we ve got the concertmaster from philadelphia orchestra for my film look at this the pride that he had a pride in the music and the music makers that all the directors i ve worked with including alfred hitchcock who relied on music and understood the need of it nobody has the same musicality the shark chase from spielberg s jaws featuring williams oscar winning score smith when he first showed you schindler s list what did you say williams oh i had a story that i d love to say what we usually do is when he finishes photography we have a session usually just the two of us and the idea was just watch the film and take it off and we would have a discussion of what the music should do and how it should work and so on and the film played and it broke my heart as anybody would know that s seen it and the last scene in the film takes place in israel where oskar schindler who was the hero of this thing and did the work to save so many lives people were coming children and adults putting stones on the graveside of oskar schindler who was buried with honor at israel and then the lights came up and it s time to start our meeting and that was like i don t bawl but i really was choked up and i said steven i just have to leave the room and i went outside and walked around collect myself and back in to start the meeting and this is just about verbatim i said steven this is a great film and you really need a better composer than i am for this film and he said i know but they re all dead laughs so i went on to become the live composer laughs smith that s a lovely story laughs williams i love to tell that story anne sophie mutter and john williams record the theme from schindler s list for the album across the stars smith i know you re a very modest man but do you ever allow yourself that moment to step back and say wow look what i ve done williams tracy i ll be completely honest with you it s very hard for me to take complete pleasure in anything that i ve made because i don t know if you have any children you love everything about every one of your children and there s always something that you wish you could correct or you wish your genes might have helped a little more laughs in this or that area and that s exactly what it is you can love it and you can love it all but you can always see things that could be improved that alas once it s out and published and so on and so forth it s gone from your control i wish i had the kind of personality i could say ah this is fantastic but i don t think in the art of music i don t think there s any place for that kind of vanity i don t know who else could possibly feel that way given the shoulders we stand on smith but your shoulders are pretty broad and strong at this point you re part of that foundation now williams well i couldn t get into the nfl laughs smith how long will you keep writing williams keep writing as long as i can you know that s a very good question about anything we do i think we always will want to do it as long as we are healthy as long as the ability to do it is there and in any kind of writing i thought the mood that you re in is very good even in your work we all will do better work when we feel good there s a little difference between a bad day and a good day or a good interview and a bad interview and so on i feel very very lucky i ve been working i don t know how many years 65 years 60 a long time and my wife occasionally will say to me do something useless go write some music or go to the piano and play something also i don t think anybody retires from music it sounds corny but it is a part of your breathing not only for musicians but everybody an octave on a stradivarius is one thing an octave on a little wooden flute in the new guinea jungle is the same thing it is universal i don t think you leave music you might end up your very last day in life singing the first song your mother taught you music i always say that it s three things it s the composer and it s an orchestra or a singer and the listener and what music is is the stuff in between the spirit of the three participants who lean on each other i need anne sophie i can write all those notes what good will it do me outside of the clutter of the room she can play it by miracles i don t know how she does it truly and then an audience hears it it s a great life i don t wanna say it s like people who have great faith which you know it s hard to understand somehow how people feel about things that belong to them and they are constants they are consistent with us always and i believe that about music i can say about anne sophie she s many things and one of the things she is is a great virtuoso who travels around the world to countries everywhere and think about the fact that the country of china right now is purchasing more pianos than the rest of the world combined i think not exaggerating what is a better connection between east west and the various competing powers than the universal language of the strad and the little white wooden flute she goes to probably every country in the world and she plays music to them and they hold her in their hands or in their hearts for a minute and she will be play whatever she plays but that s foreign policy at the highest level you don t have to be the in the state department you can do this to remind people that we are one thing we all hear the octave in the same way whatever your cultural adaptations in music and phraseology are we are one family i believe that we are one brain i m not spooky or religious or anything but i believe that smith and that s the power of music williams it is the power that music can transport between or connect between people a nexus of some kind why do people in china or japan and asia love beethoven i tell you as a composer it s very interesting you take the first page of a beethoven symphony after the introduction and give me 12 bars and then try to write the next page you can t do it no matter how much skill you have and how much training you can t quite go there in his brain the ordering is a divine gift music is a nexus it s a conduit it s a connection but the connection is the thing that will if we can ever evolve to the point if we can still mutate if we can still change and through learning get better we can master the basic things of governance and cooperation between nations at the point we ve gotten in life to where we are to be so clumsy in our governance not only in our country but around the world it s basic we should by now at this date in our history with all of our sharing of language and music and everything else we re very far behind and we haven t caught up to technology which is outreaching and outstretching our powers so that s why in tanglewood we have now the tanglewood learning institute which is not the tanglewood music institute it s the emphasis on the right word which is learning so we need to learn more learning is the thing that s gonna save us from ourselves in the end ecologically and in every other way we need to smart up not party up but learn up you can stream the anne sophie mutter john williams album across the stars by clicking on
