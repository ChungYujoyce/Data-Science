 2016 she has told aides that she wants to avoid the coronation atmosphere of her 2008 launch by glenn thrush and gabriel debenedetti 04 10 2015 07 20 am edt updated 04 10 2015 07 33 pm edt the wait is almost over hillary clinton will kick off her long anticipated campaign for president on sunday with a social media announcement three sources close to the campaign to be told politico and will begin her 2016 run for the presidency with a trip to iowa the announcement will be followed by a round of conference calls with staff supporters and potential campaign donors to outline the theme of the campaign which will focus on middle class pocketbook economics and her role as a gender trailblazer one of the people said the timing of the rollout which has leaked out to reporters over the last few days has been the subject of hot debate inside the growing clinton organization and several sources have told politico the sunday launch isn t intended to cast her as competition to florida republican sen marco rubio who is announcing his own candidacy on monday advertisement we just wanted to get this thing over with and get on with it a soon to be clinton staffer said on condition of anonymity a senior campaign staffer refused to confirm or deny previously published reports that clinton was throwing her hat in the ring and her official spokesman did not respond to a request for comment also on politico nick gass as politico reported last month the former secretary of state plans a quick tour of at least two battleground states iowa and new hampshire before settling into her new campaign headquarters in brooklyn to begin the months long work of setting up a field operation communications shop and fundraising apparatus for a campaign that many close to clinton estimate will raise and spend 1 5 to 2 billion clinton has already filmed her announcement video in which she will position herself as an alternative to the republican field expected to include former florida gov jeb bush kentucky sen rand paul wisconsin gov scott walker florida sen marco rubio new jersey gov chris christie and possibly mike huckabee former governor of arkansas who is a favorite among evangelical christians clinton has privately told her aides that she wants to avoid the coronation atmosphere of her 2008 launch and is trying to schedule what one person in her orbit described as low key events where she will interact directly with voters nearly seven years after her last appearances as a presidential candidate when she lost to then senator barack obama some supporters though are skeptical of a digital launch that may do little to soften clinton s edges i don t know why she s not doing an event with kids and families that would have made more sense to me said a supporter with close ties to clinton the news of the announcement also elicited gop attacks the republican national committee on friday tweeted a stop hillary video saying her campaign will launch in the shadow of investigations questions about her ethics also on politico dylan byers the optics of the announcement will say much about the campaign to come in january 2007 clinton ran misguidedly as it turned out on a thematic platform of inevitability and her video message emailed to supporters featured her sitting in a power pose at whitehaven her mansion in washington d c this time she is likely to emphasize her connection with middle class voters who remain disaffected with the pace of the country s spotty slow motion recovery eight years after the financial collapse and the start of the great recession the choice of iowa is also a window into the candidate s complex political psyche iowa was the beginning of the end of her 2008 candidacy and her humiliating third place finish behind barack obama and john edwards set the stage for obama s victory clinton who trashed the iowa caucus format as undemocratic during her last campaign is intent on erasing that loss and proving to voters in that critical swing state that she s willing to compete and win there even if she faces only token opposition this is a comeback she s going right into what was enemy territory i think it s smart says david yepsen longtime chief political correspondent for the des moines register and now a mass communications professor she got creamed there last time it was a real downer she had to come back now she ll try again she s going to find it s a real uplift s he s better at small events it will give her a chance to show she s warm she s friendly clinton enters the fray as the dominant front runner for the democratic nomination with few potential primary opponents expected to challenge her outside of former maryland governor martin o malley former virginia senator jim webb and vermont senator bernie sanders clinton leads all of them by wide margins in preliminary polling also on politico dylan byers clinton s team has emphasized that the 2016 rollout will be a methodical grassroots affair in keeping with clinton s i m in no hurry campaign planning process for the last several months a team of policy advisers overseen by soon to be campaign chairman john podesta have been quietly working on a series of economic proposals that will be rolled out over time they are expected to closely mirror many of president obama s more popular recent reforms to student loans and immigration a topic clinton handled gingerly in 2008 as politico reported earlier this year clinton discussed student loan reform a key issue for younger voters clinton has struggled to win over with progressive massachusetts sen elizabeth warren during a closed door meeting two months ago if clinton s 2008 campaign launch emphasized her electability her kick off slogan was i m in it to win it her 2016 is more about likability and her capacity to relate to real americans after years of mansions private jets and the damaging disclosure that she operated her own email server instead of using the state department system as dictated by department rules in a new epilogue to her 2014 memoir posted on the web site of the huffington post obama s favorite outlet in 2008 clinton emphasized her softer side something she was loathe to do eight years ago under the advice of pollster mark penn who believed voters wouldn t respond to a female candidate who showed weakness also on politico anna palmer and jake sherman i wrote this book over the course of 2013 and early 2014 mostly from a cozy sun drenched third floor study in our home in chappaqua new york she wrote wistfully there s a thick carpet and
