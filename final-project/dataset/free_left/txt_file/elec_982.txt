advertisement supported by opinion by tabitha soren i experienced eight years of weird celebrity life in the 90s as a political reporter for mtv news yes mtv once had a peabody award winning news department an argument has been made that mtv got bill clinton elected president and sent hillary clinton to the white house in 1992 by coaxing young people to vote as their vote tilted that first election his way i don t know if that is true but looking back on it you can see the first glimpses of what was to become of american politics we may not have gotten bill clinton elected but we clearly helped usher offstage a set of political attitudes that were unfriendly to his style for starters the idea that politicians like high school principals should be taken seriously everywhere i look i see 90s nostalgia in shows being rebooted memes being shared this election offers the ultimate in time travel the clintons back on the national stage this time with hillary as the candidate she is part of our 90s nostalgia but was always too serious and reserved for that decade and what are we so nostalgic for anyway i was there trust me we don t want to go back probably the first thing on anybody s mind who remembers me from my mtv days is boxers or briefs but i never asked that question of bill clinton an audience member at a mtv news town hall meeting did i was merely a moderator it was 1994 and bill clinton was addressing the subject of violence in the united states the set resembled an industrial bunker with a large map of the country in textured gold hung slightly sideways the president had a chair which he mostly left empty and we both had a microphone i am remembered for it at least in part because of the need more traditional media outlets at the time seemed to have to trivialize mtv s political coverage having done so they proceeded to imitate that which they pretended to disdain in retrospect the audience member who asked the boxers or briefs question was on to something she stood for a new cultural need to debase political candidates that eventually would take us to the point where political candidates debase themselves without the public s assistance now we know thanks to the debate performances of the republican presidential nominee donald j trump more than we ever have about what s inside the boxers or briefs mtv news was fairly earnestly trying to contribute to the sum total of human understanding about politics and political candidates albeit for young people it was mocked by important media outlets which seemed to want to see our work as an extension of mtv s reality show and music content but choose or lose as our election coverage was called took young voters seriously and we wanted them to take their vote seriously too we sensed at the time that our real crime was that we were getting too much attention as if to prove the point those important media outlets and the political process then proceeded to become more and more like the reality tv wing of mtv the pretense of a lot of political coverage today is that it aims to improve and edify our civic life the reality is that it s just whoring for attention it s not an accident that mainstream reality tv debuted in 1992 with the premiere of mtv s the real world in which a group of seven people were each paid to live together and expose every detail of themselves for several months at work in reality television is the same impulse to prefer a spectacle of abysmal behavior over people who can be honestly applauded hillary clinton in this story plays the role of both victim and perpetrator when i first met her during her husband s 1992 campaign i was excited about the possibility of her being a co president she seemed genuinely admirable and it was possible for a 20 something reporter to admire her yet scandals or pseudo scandals that the public craved dogged her and she kept her distance with me i may have interviewed bill clinton more than any other reporter during his eight years in the white house but i had zero sit downs alone with his wife when she was persuaded to do interviews with the president at her side she was so careful with her words that she seemed to have no personality she was designed for an earlier era in politics back when her husband was running mrs clinton always seemed relieved when the interview was over and only then came to life even waiting on me and cleaning up after my lunch on their campaign bus she has been dissected autopsied and minced for decades it s still a challenge for her to demonstrate emotion publicly she is better with people who have no power her empathy for children for the abused for the damaged is palpable she is less good at dealing with the things that really should not matter even now she appears to imagine that even more people are out to get her than actually are which is saying something but in a way she s right to feel the way she does people are out to know her in a way that she probably never imagined she would need to be known i was definitely guilty of wanting to know more about mrs clinton her marriage her child her upbringing her activist past than about her health care policies naturally i am thinking about hillary clinton a lot now i think about what i wanted to ask her then and the sorts of questions she is being asked now as the democratic nominee i hate that we still want her to be likable and strong i don t need her to smile more i want her to stop war from occurring to keep children from starving and to teach the police that it is as great a tragedy when they kill a black man as when they kill a white one i don t care if she s cool but then i m no longer in that coveted choose or lose demographic and i feel just a tiny bit sorry not for what we did but for what we enabled in trying to interest young people in politics mtv news inadvertently helped create a model for turning politics into entertainment it makes me almost respect hillary clinton for not being able or maybe for not even trying to adapt to that culture we are steeped in nostalgia just now the memes featuring the guy from dawson s creek are hysterical fanny packs made the fashion runways of kenzo and armani tv is retooling full house the x files and even beavis and butt head but it isn t really the 1990s people are nostalgic for it s what they might have led to but didn t advertisement
