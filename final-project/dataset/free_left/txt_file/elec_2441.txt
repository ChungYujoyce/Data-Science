 by scott shane and mark mazzetti sept 20 2018 for two years americans have tried to absorb the details of the 2016 attack spies leaked emails social media fraud and president trump s claims that it s all a hoax the times explores what we know and what it means on an october afternoon before the 2016 election a huge banner was unfurled from the manhattan bridge in new york city vladimir v putin against a russian flag background and the unlikely word peacemaker below it was a daredevil happy birthday to the russian president who was turning 64 in november shortly after donald j trump eked out a victory that moscow had worked to assist an even bigger banner appeared this time on the arlington memorial bridge in washington the face of president barack obama and goodbye murderer in big red letters police never identified who had hung the banners but there were clues the earliest promoters of the images on twitter were american sounding accounts including leroylovesusa later exposed as russian fakes operated from st petersburg to influence american voters the kremlin it appeared had reached onto united states soil in new york and washington the banners may well have been intended as visual victory laps for the most effective foreign interference in an american election in history for many americans the trump russia story as it has been voluminously reported over the past two years is a confusing tangle of unfamiliar names and cyberjargon further obscured by the shout fest of partisan politics what robert s mueller iii the special counsel in charge of the investigation may know or may yet discover is still uncertain president trump s twitter outbursts that it is all a hoax and a witch hunt in the face of a mountain of evidence to the contrary have taken a toll on public comprehension but to travel back to 2016 and trace the major plotlines of the russian attack is to underscore what we now know with certainty the russians carried out a landmark intervention that will be examined for decades to come acting on the personal animus of mr putin public and private instruments of russian power moved with daring and skill to harness the currents of american politics well connected russians worked aggressively to recruit or influence people inside the trump campaign to many americans the intervention seemed to be a surprise attack a stealth cyberage pearl harbor carried out by an inexplicably sinister russia for mr putin however it was long overdue payback a justified response to years of provocations from the united states and there is a plausible case that mr putin succeeded in delivering the presidency to his admirer mr trump though it cannot be proved or disproved in an election with an extraordinarily close margin the repeated disruption of the clinton campaign by emails published on wikileaks and the anti clinton pro trump messages shared with millions of voters by russia could have made the difference a possibility mr trump flatly rejects as mr trump emerged in spring 2016 as the improbable favorite for the republican nomination the russian operation accelerated on three fronts the hacking and leaking of democratic documents massive fraud on facebook and twitter and outreach to trump campaign associates consider 10 days in march on march 15 of that year mr trump won five primaries closing in on his party s nomination and crowed that he had become the biggest political story anywhere in the world that same day in moscow a veteran hacker named ivan yermakov a russian military intelligence officer working for a secret outfit called unit 26165 began probing the computer network of the democratic national committee in st petersburg shift workers posted on facebook and twitter at a feverish pace posing as americans and following instructions to attack mrs clinton on march 21 in washington mr trump announced his foreign policy team a group of fringe figures whose advocacy of warmer relations with russia ran counter to republican orthodoxy meanwhile unit 26165 was poring over the bounty from a separate attack it had just carried out 50 000 emails stolen from the clinton campaign s chairman on march 24 one of the members of the trump foreign policy team george papadopoulos sat in the cafe of an upscale london hotel with a russian woman who introduced herself as mr putin s niece and offered to help set up a meeting between the russian president and mr trump the woman and the adviser exchanged frequent messages in the weeks that followed today mr padadopoulos is unsure that those messages came from the person he met in the cafe the russian intervention was essentially a hijacking of american companies like facebook and twitter of american citizens feelings about immigration and race of american journalists eager for scoops however modest of the na ve or perhaps not so na ve ambitions of mr trump s advisers the russian trolls hackers and agents totaled barely 100 and their task was to steer millions of american voters they knew it would take a village to sabotage an election russians or suspected russian agents including oligarchs diplomats former military officers and shadowy intermediaries had dozens of contacts during the campaign with mr trump s associates they reached out through email facebook and twitter they sought introductions through trusted business connections of mr trump s obscure academic institutions veterans groups and the national rifle association they met trump campaign aides in moscow london new york and louisville ky one claimed the russians had dirt on hillary clinton another russian the trump campaign was told would deliver it in may and june alone the trump campaign fielded at least four invitations to meet with russian intermediaries or officials in nearly every case the trump aides and associates seemed enthusiastic about their exchanges with the russians over months of such probing it seems that no one alerted the federal bureau of investigation to the foreign overtures mr trump s position on the russian contacts has evolved over time first that there were none then that they did not amount to collusion next that in any case collusion was not a crime that is mere semantics conspiracy is the technical legal term for abetting the russians in breaking american laws such as those outlawing computer hacking and banning foreign assistance to a campaign whether mr trump or any of his associates conspired with the russians is a central question of the investigation by mr mueller who has already charged 26 russians and won convictions or guilty pleas from the former national security adviser michael t flynn the former campaign chairman paul j manafort and his deputy rick gates and from mr papadopoulos mr trump s personal lawyer michael d cohen has pleaded guilty in a separate case but none of the convictions to date involve conspiracy there remains an alternative explanation to the collusion theory that the trump aides far from certain their candidate would win were happy to meet the russians because they thought it might lead to moneymaking deals after the election black caviar read the subject line of an email mr manafort got in july 2016 from his associate in kiev ukraine hinting at the possibility of new largess from a russian oligarch with whom they had done business nina l khrushcheva a professor of international affairs at the new school and the great granddaughter of the soviet premier nikita s khrushchev said that what russia pulled off through creativity and sheer luck would have been the envy of mr putin s predecessors puncturing the american sense of superiority and insisting on russia s power and place in the world this operation was to show the americans that you bastards are just as screwed up as the rest of us professor khrushcheva said putin fulfilled the dream of every soviet leader to stick it to the united states i think this will be studied by the k g b s

of wrongdoing by trump and associates january 2018 september 2018 by the new york times see the full timeline of events the russian leader thought the united states and hillary clinton had sought to undermine his presidency the first russian advance party was tiny two women on a whirlwind american tour hitting nine states in three weeks in summer 2014 anna bogacheva and aleksandra krylova were supposed to gather intelligence to help them mimic americans on facebook and twitter they snapped photos and chatted up strangers from california to new york on a sort of russian thelma louise road trip for the era of social media even then federal prosecutors would later say the russian government was thinking about the next united states presidential election perhaps ahead of most americans ms bogacheva and ms krylova had been dispatched by their employer an online propaganda factory in st petersburg to prepare to influence american voters but why did mr putin care about the election then more than two years away he was seething the united states in his view had bullied and interfered with russia for long enough it was high time to fight back his motives were rooted in russia s ambivalence toward the west captured in the history of st petersburg russia s spectacular northern city and mr putin s hometown peter the great the brutal but westward looking 18th century czar had brought in the best italian architects to construct russia s window on europe in a swamp czar peter s portrait replaced vladimir lenin s in mr putin s office when he took a job working for the city s mayor in the early 1990s twenty five years later the internet offered a different kind of window on the west a portal that could be used for a virtual invasion mr putin a former k g b officer had described the breakup of the soviet union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century a remarkable statement from a man whose country experienced revolution civil war bloody purges and the deaths of 27 million people in world war ii like many of his fellow citizens mr putin was nostalgic for russia s lost superpower status and he resented what he saw as american arrogance the russian leader believed the united states had relentlessly sought to undermine russian sovereignty and his own legitimacy the united states had backed democratic anti russian forces in the so called color revolutions on russia s borders in georgia in 2003 and ukraine in 2004 it had funded pro democracy russian activists through american organizations with millions in state department grants each year with little evidence mr putin believed this american meddling helped produce street demonstrations in moscow and other cities in 2011 with crowds complaining of a rigged parliamentary election

their votes counted and that means they deserve free fair transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them mr putin blamed mrs clinton for the turmoil claiming that when she spoke out his political enemies heard the signal and with the support of the u s state department began active work the two tangled again the next year when mr putin pushed for a eurasian union that would in effect compete with the european union mrs clinton sharply dismissed the notion calling it a scheme to re sovietize the region and saying the united states would try to block it by 2013 with his initial hopes for a reset of russian relations dashed mr obama like his top diplomat no longer bothered to be diplomatic he criticized russia s anti gay legislation part of mr putin s effort to become a global champion for conservative values and gave a biting description of the russian leader he s got that kind of slouch looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom mr putin was reported to be furious after russian troops seized crimea and carried out a stealth invasion of ukraine in 2014 relations grew openly hostile american support for the new government in kiev and condemnation of russian behavior heightened mr putin s rage at being told what he could do and not do in what he considered his own backyard if russia had only a fraction of the united states military might and nothing like its economic power it had honed its abilities in hacking and influence operations through attacks in eastern europe and it could turn these weapons on america to even the score by making mischief in the 2016 election mr putin could wreak revenge on his enemy mrs clinton the presumed democratic nominee damaging if not defeating her he could highlight the polarized state of american democracy making it a less appealing model for russians and their neighbors and he could send a message that russia would not meekly submit to a domineering america hence the two russian women who toured the united states in 2014 keyboard warriors granted the unusual privilege of real world travel hitting both coasts illinois louisiana and texas at that point according to a russian document cited by the special counsel mr putin s intentions for 2016 were already explicit to spread distrust toward the candidates and the political system in general in the intervening two years mr putin s ire at america only increased he blamed the united states for pushing for a full investigation of illicit doping by russian athletes which would lead to mass suspensions of the country s olympic stars and when the leaked panama papers were published in april 2016 revealing that a cellist who was mr putin s close friend had secret accounts that had handled 2 billion he charged that it was a smear operation by the united states who is behind these provocations he asked we know that among them are employees of official american institutions then something unexpected happened of the more than 20 major party candidates running for the american presidency only mr trump had repeatedly expressed admiration for mr putin as a strong leader and brushed off criticism of russia only he had little interest in the traditional american preoccupation with democracy and human rights only he had explored business interests in russia for years repeatedly pursuing a trump tower project in moscow and bringing his beauty pageant there in 2013 do you think putin will be going to the miss universe pageant in november in moscow the future candidate tweeted at the time adding wistfully if so will he become my new best friend if mr putin had been designing his ideal leader for the united states he could hardly have done better than donald trump for some years mr trump had attracted attention from russian conservatives with kremlin ties a putin ally named konstantin rykov had begun promoting mr trump as a future president in 2012 and created a russian language website three years later to support his candidacy a russian think tank katehon had begun running analyses pushing mr trump mr trump as a candidate was tough rough says what he thinks rude emotional and apparently candid wrote alexander dugin an ultranationalist philosopher considered a major influence on mr putin in february 2016 mr dugin declared that mr trump probably had no chance of winning against the quite annoying mrs clinton but added a postscript we want to put trust in donald trump vote for trump and see what will happen against all expectations republicans across the country began to do just that and soon mr trump was beating the crowd of mainstream republicans mr putin said yuval weber a russia scholar found for the first time since the collapse of the u s s r that he has a prospective president of the united states who fundamentally views international issues from the russian point of view asked about the surging mr trump in december 2015 mr putin said he was a talent without any doubt and absolutely the leader in the presidential race he also applied to the candidate the russian word yarkii which means colorful or flamboyant but which some reports mistranslated as brilliant an assessment that mr trump immediately began repeating it s always a great honor to be so nicely complimented mr trump said by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond as donald j trump emerged as the favorite for the nomination his campaign brought on aides tied to russia mr trump had steamrollered his primary opponents in part by taking aim at republican foreign policy orthodoxy the post 9 11 wars were foolish and costly he would often say at campaign events america s allies were deadbeats and freeloaders he told supporters who cheered in agreement russia was not an existential threat he said but a potential ally in beating back terrorist groups in early march 2016 the establishment struck back in an open letter dozens of the party s national security luminaries vowed publicly to try to stop the election of a candidate so utterly unfitted to the office they took particular umbrage at mr trump s remarks about the russian president writing that his admiration for foreign dictators such as vladimir putin is unacceptable for the leader of the world s greatest democracy but mr trump was not cowed he soon signed on new advisers and aides including some who had been pushed to the fringe of a political party that had long lionized president ronald reagan for staring down soviet leaders at the height of the cold war to the kremlin they must have looked like a dream team mr flynn the former head of the defense intelligence agency had long viewed russia as a natural ally in what he saw as a world war against radical islam in june 2013 when he was d i a chief he sat inside the imposing headquarters of the g r u russia s military intelligence agency and chatted with officers two years later he sat at mr putin s elbow at a gala dinner in moscow mr manafort a longtime republican lobbyist had earned millions working for a pro kremlin leader in ukraine and had a history of business dealings with oleg deripaska a russian aluminum magnate close to mr putin he was nearly broke when he joined the trump campaign in march 2016 hired to help prevent a mass defection of convention delegates and yet he offered to work on the campaign unpaid carter page a businessman who spent several years working in moscow was virtually unknown in washington when mr trump appointed him a foreign policy adviser but the s v r russia s foreign intelligence service knew who he was in 2013 mr page met in new york with a russian spy posing as an attach at the united nations and passed along energy industry documents in hopes of securing lucrative deals in moscow the f b i which had been tracking russian spies when mr page came on the bureau s radar determined that he had no idea he was meeting with a russian agent i promised him a lot said the spy victor podobnyy speaking to another russian intelligence officer about his dealings with mr page according to an f b i transcript how else to work with foreigners you promise a favor for a favor the new team was in place by the end of march and mr trump had a new message that was strikingly similar to one of mr putin s most ardent talking points i think nato s obsolete mr trump said during an interview on abc s this week nato s not meant for terrorism he went on to say nato doesn t have the right countries in it for terrorism by then the russian intelligence operation to intervene in the american election including efforts to infiltrate and influence the trump campaign had begun mr papadopoulos the 28 year old campaign adviser did not know this when he met in the cafe of the london hotel with mr putin s niece he has no niece and an obscure maltese professor in late march the academic had taken an interest in mr papadopoulos when he joined the campaign f b i agents have identified the professor joseph mifsud as a likely cutout for russian intelligence sent to establish contact with mr papadopoulos and possibly get information about the direction of the trump campaign he disappeared after his name surfaced last october and his whereabouts is unknown at one point he changed his whatsapp status to a simple if cryptic message alive professor mifsud arranged an email introduction between mr papadopoulos and a russian foreign ministry official the american also exchanged emails with olga polonskaya the woman in the cafe we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with mr trump she wrote in one message and the two discussed a possible meeting between mr putin and mr trump over time though mr papadopoulos came to question whether the messages were actually from ms polonskaya the woman he had met in the cafe barely spoke english the emails he received were in nearly perfect english i even remember sending her a message asking if i m speaking to the same person i met in london because the conversations were so strange he said during an interview this month in late april mr trump gave his first major foreign policy address in the ballroom of a historic washington hotel some of the speech was a familiar litany of republican policy positions hawkish warnings to iran and pledges to be tough on terrorism but midway through the speech as russia s ambassador to the united states watched from the front seats mr trump pivoted and said the united states and russia should look for areas of mutual interest common sense says this cycle this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon he said that s the signal to meet mr papadopoulos wrote in an email to his russian foreign ministry contact that evening meaning that mr trump s favorable comments about russia suggested he might be interested in meeting mr putin just one day earlier professor mifsud had told the campaign aide about a possible gift from moscow thousands of hacked emails that might damage mrs clinton s candidacy it was a breathtaking revelation but there was no evidence that mr papadopoulos while ambitious and eager for advancement in the bare bones campaign passed the information along to anyone inside the trump circle more than two years later mr papadopoulos says he has no recollection of telling anyone in the campaign about the emails he said he was supposed to have a phone call that day with stephen miller a top campaign adviser but it was postponed if the two men had talked mr papadopoulos said he might have shared the information how fate works sometimes i guess said mr papadopoulos who has been sentenced to 14 days in jail for lying to the f b i as mr trump continued to win primaries and vacuum up convention delegates late in the spring the russians made multiple attempts to establish contact with campaign officials a republican operative connected to the n r a tried to arrange a meeting between mr trump and a russian central banker at an n r a convention in kentucky in may putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with mr trump wrote the operative paul erickson in an email with the subject kremlin connection ever since hillary compared putin to hitler all senior russian leaders consider her beyond redemption mr page the foreign policy adviser was invited to deliver the commencement address at the prestigious new economic school in moscow that invitation now appears to have been an effort both to gain information about the trump campaign and to influence it by feting mr page in the russian capital russian television that year was describing him as a famous american economist but he was an obscure figure in this country at that time the last american to give the commencement speech was mr obama who used the opportunity to criticize russia for its treatment of georgia and ukraine mr page though criticized the hypocrisy of the united states and its nato allies for lecturing russia about bullying its neighbors which were former soviet republics while the westerners were taking proactive steps to encourage regime change overseas during his time in moscow mr page met with at least one top russian official and numerous business leaders and there was the now infamous june 2016 approach to donald trump jr by russians whom he and his father had known from their days taking the miss universe pageant to moscow the russians met at trump tower in manhattan with top campaign officials after promising damaging information on mrs clinton see the timeline of events that surround the trump tower meeting what exactly transpired during the meeting is still a mystery but it appears that the russians pulled a bait and switch they used the session to push for an end to the crippling economic sanctions that mr obama had imposed on russia donald trump jr has said how disappointed he and other campaign advisers were that they didn t get what the russians had promised the campaign s reaction to the russian attempts to discredit mrs clinton s campaign was not to rebuff them or call law enforcement it was to try to exploit them experts who have studied russian operations for decades see the catalog of contacts and communications between russians and mr trump s advisers as a loosely coordinated effort by russian intelligence both to get insight into the campaign and to influence it the russians aren t reckless and i don t see them going through with this effort without thinking they had a willing partner in the dance said rolf mowatt larssen a former c i a officer who served as the spy agency s station chief in moscow by midsummer 2016 the russian contacts sounded alarms inside the f b i where agents had received a tip about mr papadopoulos and puzzled over mr page s moscow visit the bureau sent a trusted informant to help understand what was happening stefan halper a former nixon and reagan adviser and professor at cambridge university reached out to mr page and mr papadopoulos under false pretenses american officials have defended professor halper s work saying the use of such a confidential informant is routine in a counterintelligence investigation mr trump and his allies in congress and the media have called him something different a spy sent by the obama administration to infiltrate the campaign eventually mr trump would use such episodes as a foundation for his view that america s law enforcement agencies had been aligned against him from the beginning ammunition for a looming war with the deep state this idea would consume mr trump after he became president feeding his sense of grievance that the legitimacy of his victory was under attack and shaping his decisions as he tried to blunt the widening russia investigation the long promised dirt the russians had on mrs clinton would soon be made public three days after the trump tower meeting the founder of wikileaks julian assange appeared on a british sunday television show he said that his website would soon be publishing a raft of emails related to mrs clinton and he said something at once ominous and prescient wikileaks has a very big year ahead using a hacker persona russian military intelligence officers began to reveal documents stolen from the democrats a website made its splashy debut three days later presenting a jaunty hacker who called himself guccifer 2 0 he had broken into the democratic national committee s computer network guccifer said offering as proof a selection of purloined documents here are just a few docs from many thousands i extracted when hacking into the dnc s network guccifer wrote on june 15 the main part of the papers thousands of files and mails i gave to wikileaks he added which seemed to explain mr assange s boast russian intelligence had worked fast just the day before d n c officials and their cybersecurity contractor crowdstrike had announced that russian hackers had penetrated the committee s computer network overnight russian military intelligence officers set up the website and created the guccifer persona to counter the d n c accusations guccifer a name borrowed from a real romanian hacker was presented as a jovial romanian a lone hacker who in his posts wanted to make one thing very clear he had nothing whatsoever to do with russia it seems the guys from crowdstrike and the dnc he wrote would say i m a russian bear even if i were a catholic nun in fact beyond the conclusions of crowdstrike and the f b i there were clues from the start that guccifer s posts came from moscow the name of the founder of the soviet secret police was embedded in guccifer s documents written using a russian version of microsoft word yet the guccifer gambit would prove remarkably effective at creating doubt about russia s responsibility for the hack republican operatives working on congressional campaigns emailed guccifer and received hacked documents relevant to their races for journalists the claims of the supposed lone hacker made the role of russian intelligence seem to be a disputed allegation rather than a proven fact today there is no doubt who hacked the d n c and the clinton campaign a detailed indictment of 12 officers of russia s military intelligence agency filed in july by mr mueller documents their every move including their break in techniques their tricks to hide inside the democrats networks and even their google searches see the timeline of hacking that led to the indictment the agency now called the main directorate but often referred to by its former abbreviation the g r u proved agile brazen and not terribly discreet the same pattern it would show two years later in the nerve agent poisoning in england of its former officer the defector sergei v skripal the hacking might have drawn little attention had the g r u stopped there simply stealing emails to peruse for intelligence clues but the russians decision to leak the emails to undercut mrs clinton s candidacy was a huge escalation the russian officers political skills proved equal to their hacking expertise they deftly manipulated a long list of americans and europeans many of whom embraced guccifer s tall tale and took seriously the claim that the other russian false front dcleaks com was run by american hacktivists guccifer 2 0 addressed a cybersecurity conference in london via messages to one of the organizers the purported romanian jousted with a suspicious reporter for motherboard insisting i don t like russians and their foreign policy i hate being attributed to russia when twitter suspended the dcleaks account the fox business host lou dobbs accused the company of leftist fascism the account was swiftly reinstated but the russians masterstroke was to enlist via the guccifer persona the help of wikileaks neither of the russians websites guccifer 2 0 or dcleaks com had much reach but wikileaks had a large global audience its editor mr assange shared mr putin s hatred of mrs clinton and had a soft spot for russia mr assange assisted with the subterfuge he repeatedly denied that he d received the documents from russia whether he was really taken in by the guccifer ruse is uncertain but he also obscured the russian role by fueling a right wing conspiracy theory he knew to be false he offered a 20 000 reward for information about the murder in washington of seth rich a young d n c staffer shot to death in an apparent bungled street robbery trump supporters were suggesting mr rich had leaked the d n c emails and been killed in retaliation and mr assange played along in a discussion about wikileaks sources on dutch television in august 2016 mr assange suddenly brought up mr rich s killing that was just a robbery i believe wasn t it the interviewer said what are you suggesting i m suggesting that our sources take risks mr assange said and then declined to say if mr rich was a source such misleading interviews helped camouflage the russian origin of the leak and wikileaks adept timing gave the emails big impact after some technical problems according to mr mueller s indictment guccifer passed the entire archive of d n c emails to wikileaks the website published 19 252 of them on july 22 2016 three days before the democratic national convention the russians work detonated with powerful political effect the emails exposure of d n c staffers support for mrs clinton and scorn for senator bernie sanders her chief rival forced the committee s chairwoman representative debbie wasserman schultz to resign the resentment of the sanders delegates deepened leaving the party even more bitterly divided as it turned to the general election unknown to the feuding democratic delegates a cyberdrama had been playing out in secret for weeks as crowdstrike experts tried to root out the russian hackers who had penetrated the d n c and its sister organization the democratic congressional campaign committee robert s johnston a lead investigator for crowdstrike said the russian hackers uniformed officers of military intelligence were like a thunderstorm moving through the system very very noisy crowdstrike had begun watching the russians in april asking d n c staffers to keep quiet about the intrusion we only talked over signal an encrypted text and call service said mr johnston a former marine and veteran of the united states cyber command who is now chief executive of the cybersecurity firm adlumin only by following the hackers for several weeks could crowdstrike be certain it had found the russians tools and blocked their access but somehow possibly by intercepting communications inside the d n c or the f b i which was investigating the breach the g r u officers learned they had been spotted on may 31 two weeks before the public disclosure of the hack ivan yermakov a g r u hacker who had used american sounding online personas kate s milton james mcmorgans and karen w millen suddenly began searching online for information about crowdstrike he sought to find out what the cybersleuths knew about the russians main tool a nasty piece of malware called x agent the indictment noted after that the spy versus spy contest escalated we knew it was the russians and they knew we knew mr johnston said i would say it was the cyber equivalent of hand to hand combat the candidate favored by the russians alternated between denying their help and seeming to welcome it on june 15 the day after the d n c hack was disclosed the trump campaign pitched in with a novel idea to deflect blame from the russians the d n c had somehow hacked itself we believe it was the d n c that did the hacking as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate the statement said later mr trump tried out other alternative theories perhaps the hack had been carried out by somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds or a some guy in his home in new jersey or the chinese or almost anyone but at other times he appeared to accept that russia was responsible the new joke in town mr trump tweeted on july 25 is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc emails which should have never been written stupid because putin likes me and two days later he famously invited the russians to try to retrieve 30 000 emails that mrs clinton had deleted from her computer server on the basis that they involved personal matters and not state department business russia if you re listening i hope you re able to find the 30 000 emails that are missing mr trump said during a florida news conference the mueller investigation discovered that the russians were evidently listening the same day as the news conference the g r u hackers began sending so called spearphishing emails to accounts associated with mrs clinton s personal office mr trump s pronouncements stood in striking contrast to the responses of past presidential candidates who had been offered assistance by foreign powers in 1960 both adlai e stevenson and john f kennedy refused quiet offers of help from khrushchev because we know the ideas of mr stevenson we in our hearts all favor him khrushchev said in a message passed on by the soviet ambassador could the soviet press assist mr stevenson s personal success how mr stevenson declined the offer in language that reflected the broad american political consensus about foreign election interference i believe i made it clear to him mr stevenson wrote that i considered the offer of such assistance highly improper indiscreet and dangerous to all concerned russia did not deliver on mr trump s request for mrs clinton s deleted emails but it had obtained something just as useful 50 000 emails of john podesta mrs clinton s campaign chairman stolen via a phishing attack by the g r u roger stone a political operative and longtime trump friend seemed to have advance word trust me he wrote on twitter on aug 25 it would soon be podesta s time in the barrel but wikileaks withheld the podesta emails for months after receiving them from guccifer in june evidently waiting for the right moment to have the biggest impact on the race the time came on oct 7 amid two blows to the trump campaign see the timeline of events that surround the release of the emails that day american intelligence agencies made their first official statement that the russian government with the approval of its senior most officials was behind the hacking and leaking of the democratic emails and then came a potentially lethal disclosure for the trump campaign the shocking access hollywood recording in which mr trump bragged of groping and sexually assaulting women the candidate desperately needed to change the subject and that was the moment wikileaks posted the first of thousands of mr podesta s emails they were invaluable for political journalists offering embarrassing comments from staffers about mrs clinton s shortcomings and the full texts of her highly paid speeches to banks and corporations which she had refused to release wikileaks assisted by highlighting interesting tidbits in yellow soon mr trump was delighting his supporters by reading from the stolen emails on the campaign trail now this just came out he told a fired up crowd in wilkes barre pa in october brandishing a page of highlights wikileaks i love wikileaks crooked hillary had said behind closed doors mr trump declared that terrorism was not a threat that she had a great relationship with the financial industry that isis might infiltrate groups of refugees coming to the united states that a politician needed to have both a public and private position on policies and on and on the quotes were taken out of context of course and subjected to the most damaging interpretation but they seemed to offer a glimpse of mrs clinton s hidden views for the last month of the campaign in daily releases that kept the clinton team on the defensive wikileaks delivered the russians gift if the july d n c dump had been an explosion the october series was more like unrelenting sniper fire whether the timing was decided by the russians or by mr assange it proved devastatingly effective russian trolls using fake accounts on social media reached nearly as many americans as would vote in the election david michael smith a houston political scientist and activist spotted the alarming call on facebook a group called heart of texas was suddenly urging texans to come at noon on may 21 2016 to protest a 14 year old islamic center in downtown houston stop islamization of texas the post declared with a photo of the islamic da wah center which it called a shrine of hatred it invited protesters to prepare for battle feel free to bring along your firearms concealed or not we immediately asked what the blank is the heart of texas recalled mr smith who started calling friends to organize a counterprotest months later he would find out heart of texas which garnered a quarter million followers on facebook was one of 470 facebook pages created 5 000 miles from houston at the internet research agency the oddly named st petersburg company that would become the world s most famous manipulator of social media the two russian employees who had visited texas during that 2014 american tour ms bogacheva and ms krylova evidently had returned home with big ideas about how to exploit the emotional chasms in american politics and culture just as the russians guccifer character had reached out to american activists journalists and wikileaks the russian online trolls understood that their real political power would come from mobilizing americans the russian company s formula was simple tap into a simmering strain of opinion in the united states and pour on the fuel consider the texas protest after the russians put up the stop islamization facebook post several dozen like minded texans added their own incendiary comments allah sucks wrote one adding a threat to kill any muslim who tried to visit him another wrote of the islamic center need to blow this place up a dozen yelling white supremacists turned out for the protest at least two of them with assault rifles and a third with a pistol others held confederate flags and a white lives matter banner houston police managed to keep them away from a much larger crowd of counterprotesters some of whom had responded to a second russian facebook call in a blatant attempt to create a confrontation another internet research agency page this one called united muslims of america had asked people to rally at exactly the same time and place to save islamic knowledge the event had no lasting consequences though clearly it could have ended in tragedy still it demonstrated that young russians tapping on keyboards in 12 hour shifts could act as puppet masters for unsuspecting americans many time zones away when facebook first acknowledged last year the russian intrusion on its platform it seemed modest in scale the 100 000 spent on ads was a trivial sum compared with the tens of millions spent on facebook by both the trump and clinton campaigns see the timeline of events that shows russia s social media campaign but it quickly became clear that the russians had used a different model for their influence campaign posting inflammatory messages and relying on free viral spread even by the vertiginous standards of social media the reach of their effort was impressive 2 700 fake facebook accounts 80 000 posts many of them elaborate images with catchy slogans and an eventual audience of 126 million americans

nov source darren linvill and patrick warren clemson university by the new york times and facebook was only the biggest of the engines powering the russian messages on instagram there were 170 ersatz russian accounts that posted 120 000 times and reached about 20 million people twitter reported that in the 10 weeks before the election some 3 814 internet research agency accounts interacted with 1 4 million people and that another 50 258 automated bot accounts that the company judged to be russia linked tweeted about the election the trolls created at least two podcasts posted vine videos blogged on tumblr sought donations via paypal and even exploited the pok mon go craze without american social media companies the russian influence campaign could not have operated the st petersburg trolls tapped the power of silicon valley for their stealth intervention in american democracy darren linvill a professor at clemson university who has studied three million internet research agency tweets said he was impressed with both their level of absurdist creativity and keen understanding of american psychology they knew exactly what buttons to press and operated with industrial efficiency he said the russian troll operation had gotten its start two years before focusing at first on government targets closer to home in 2014 vitaly bespalov then 23 finished a journalism degree in the siberian city of tyumen and signed on as a content manager at the internet research agency which looked vaguely like a digital marketing firm and offered a relatively generous salary of 1 000 a month mr bespalov was surprised to discover that his job was to write or swipe stories to post on counterfeit ukrainian websites spinning the conflict there to fit the russian government s view he had to be sure always to use the word terrorists for the ukrainian fighters opposed to the russian invasion that was tearing the country apart my first days on the job i was in shock i had no idea what kind of an operation this was mr bespalov said in a recent interview while vacationing in ukraine his first visit to the country about which he had written so many bogus stories he was put off by the company s work but said he chose to stick around for several months in part to study its operations it was very monotonous and boring mr bespalov said it seemed that almost no one liked this work but almost nobody quit because everyone needed the money soon he began hearing about a new secretive department inside the st petersburg company that was recruiting english speakers to focus on the united states like peter the great the internet research agency borrowed western technology while shunning western notions of democracy as mr bespalov quickly realized the company was not a normal business but a well compensated tool of the russian state it was owned by yevgeny v prigozhin who overcame an early prison sentence for robbery to create a thriving catering business he then built a fortune as a loyal contractor willing to provide internet trolls mercenary soldiers or anything else required by his patron mr putin in the company s new department some 80 young english speakers worked in shifts to feed facebook pages and twitter accounts imitating the snark and fury of outraged americans they stole photos favoring attractive young women for their twitter profiles they copied or created sharp poster like commentaries on american life and politics only occasionally slipping up with grammatical mistakes they focused their efforts on pages that touched american nerves with names like guns4life pray for police stop all invaders south united and mimicking mr trump america first if mr trump was borrowing the hacked emails from the russians for his stump speeches the online trolls in st petersburg returned the favor picking up the candidate s populist rhetoric even pages that seemed nominally hostile to him often worked in his favor woke blacks critiqued mrs clinton for alleged hostility to african americans united muslims of america showed her with a woman in a head scarf and a slogan support hillary save american muslims that seemed aimed at generating a backlash the russians managed to call a dozen or more rallies like the one in houston sometimes paying unwitting american activists for their help via money transfer the same method may have been used to get the bridge banners of mr putin and mr obama hung an internet research agency twitter account cassishere posted a photo of the putin banner on the manhattan bridge winning a credit from the new york daily news in washington the russian account leroylovesusa tweeted about suspending the obama banner then added more tweets with critiques of mr obama s foreign policy in stilted english facebook reluctant to step into the divisive politics of the trump presidency did not acknowledge the russian intrusion until nearly a year after the election asserting that russia had chiefly aimed at sowing division a closer look suggested a more focused goal damaging mrs clinton and promoting mr trump many of the facebook memes portrayed mrs clinton as angry corrupt or crazed mr trump was depicted as his campaign preferred strong decisive courageous willing to shun political correctness to tell hard truths the russian operation also boosted jill stein the green party candidate who had dined with mr putin in moscow to draw votes from mrs clinton it encouraged supporters of mr sanders to withhold their votes from mrs clinton even after he endorsed her the impact is impossible to gauge the internet research agency was a kremlin fire hose of influence wielded amid a hurricane of a presidential election christopher painter who had served under president george w bush at the justice department and as the state department s coordinator for cyberissues from 2011 to 2017 said the propaganda flood and the leaked emails certainly affected the vote but no one can say whether it made the difference in an election decided by the tiniest of margins fewer than 100 000 votes in three states it s impossible to know how much voter suppression it caused discouraging people from coming out mr painter said it s impossible to know how many votes it changed he added that people don t like to admit they ve been fooled hence the strenuous efforts from mr trump and his supporters to deny or dismiss the significance of the russian interference a case in point would be harry miller a devoted trump supporter in florida who was paid to organize a rally in which a woman portraying mrs clinton sat behind bars on the back of his pickup truck it turned out that the people who had ordered up the rally matt skiber and joshua milton were pseudonyms for russians at the internet research agency according to the mueller indictment but don t tell that to mr miller contacted via twitter he insisted that he had not been manipulated by russian trolls they were not russians and you know it mr miller wrote adding if you don t then you are the one snookered the president has created doubts about the investigation and an affinity for russia among his supporters the white house statement released at 7 21 p m on may 17 2017 was measured even anodyne reacting to the news that mr mueller had been appointed special counsel for the russia investigation the statement quoted mr trump saying that he was looking forward to this matter concluding quickly and that in the meantime he would be fighting for the people and issues that matter most to the future of our country exactly 12 hours and 31 minutes later early in the morning without his staff around him he told the world what he really thought this is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in american history he wrote in a tweet it had been little more than a week since the president had fired his f b i director james b comey but the russia thing wasn t going away now the president was up against someone who could become even more formidable a careful tenacious former marine whose stewardship of the f b i during the bush and obama years had been praised by washington s establishment mr trump s instinct was to fire mr mueller but he settled for a different strategy he has used all his power to try to discredit the special counsel s investigation revelation upon revelation about russian encounters with trump associates has followed in the months since mr mueller was appointed intensifying the fear in the white house mr trump has used his twitter pulpit to repeatedly assault the mueller inquiry and has made scathing remarks at rallies about claims of russian interference it s a hoax o k he told a pennsylvania crowd last month the attacks have had an impact on how americans view the country s national security apparatus how they view the russia story even how they view russia itself see the full timeline of mr trump s repeated denials and attacks the strategy has helped sow doubts about the special counsel s work in part because mr mueller and his prosecutors only rarely go public with the evidence they have been steadily gathering in secret interviews and closed door sessions of a grand jury during a period of 146 days over this year between the feb 16 indictment of the internet research agency operatives and the july 13 indictment of russian intelligence officers mr mueller s office was effectively silent the president was not sending at least 94 tweets that denied he had been involved in collusion called the russian interference a hoax or labeled the mueller investigation a witch hunt indictment of internet research agency operatives indictment of russian intelligence officers each box represents one trump tweet calling the russia investigation a hoax or a witch hunt or

each box represents one trump tweet calling the russia investigation a hoax or a witch hunt or disputes any notion of collusion jan 2017 april july oct jan 2018 indictment of internet research agency operatives april indictment of russian intelligence officers july by july one poll showed that 45 percent of americans disapproved of how mr mueller was handling the investigation a 14 point increase from january the shift was even more dramatic among republican voters from 49 percent to 78 percent more recent polls conducted since the indictment of the g r u officers and mr manafort s conviction have shown a reversal of the trend the president s aides hardly make a secret of their goal to discredit the investigation before a jury of the public there is little expectation that mr mueller would ignore justice department guidelines and try to indict a sitting president so mr trump s lawyers see congress and impeachment as the only threat turn the public against impeachment the thinking goes and congress is less likely to act mueller is now slightly more distrusted than trusted and trump is a little ahead of the game rudolph w giuliani the president s omnipresent lawyer told the new york times last month without citing any data to buttress his assertion so i think we ve done really well he said and my client s happy mr trump s frustration with the russian investigation is not surprising he is right that no public evidence has emerged showing that his campaign conspired with russia in the election interference or accepted russian money but the inquiry has buffeted his presidency provoked concern that his attempts to thwart the investigation amount to obstruction of justice and fed his suspicion that the f b i and intelligence agencies what he calls the deep state are conspiring against him the desire of the president to make deals with mr putin and the longstanding skepticism of the intelligence community about russian intentions and actions might have made a clash inevitable but mr trump appears to have had success in persuading some americans that the spy and law enforcement agencies are corrupt and hyperpartisan he has scrambled alliances that solidified over decades including the republican party s reflexive support of the national security agencies a president in open war with the f b i once inconceivable is now part of the daily news cycle mr trump began laying the foundation immediately after he won the presidency when he questioned the intelligence agencies findings that russia had disrupted the election and likened america s spies to nazis since taking office he has worked with partners in congress to cast the agencies as part of an insurgency against the white house it continued in july when he stood next to mr putin in helsinki finland and declared that he trusted the russian president s assurances that moscow was innocent of interfering in the 2016 election and it continues today early one morning last week hours before flying to pennsylvania to honor the victims of the flight that crashed on sept 11 2001 the president fired off a tweet that appeared to quote something he had seen on fox news we have found nothing to show collusion between president trump russia absolutely zero but every day we get more documentation showing collusion between the fbi doj the hillary campaign foreign spies russians incredible the reshuffling of alliances has seeped into the media where the president s reliable allies have been joined by voices on the left to dismiss the russia story as overblown they warn of a new red scare on fox news the network where sean hannity fulminates nightly about mr mueller and his team the journalist glenn greenwald a founder of the left leaning news site the intercept and a champion of government whistle blowers has appeared regularly to dismiss revelations about the investigation and decry officials willing to leak even at the expense of committing crimes in order to damage mr trump multiple frenzied television segments and hyped news stories have given credence to the concerns of mr greenwald and others about a 21st century mccarthyism and critics of the deep state were given powerful ammunition after the release of text messages between two f b i officials involved in the russia investigation peter strzok and lisa page that revealed their animosity toward mr trump the pair who were involved in a romantic relationship at the time have been skewered regularly on mr hannity s show as the trump hating f b i lovebirds meanwhile mr trump s glowing words about mr putin and russia have created a new affinity for russia in particular its social conservatism and toughness on terrorism among mr trump s most devoted supporters during a period of myriad accounts about russia s attempts to disrupt the last election the percentage of republicans who view mr putin favorably has more than doubled from 11 percent to 25 percent according to a poll by the pew research center democrats are now far more likely than republicans to see russia as a threat an october 2017 poll showed that 63 percent of democrats and just 38 percent of republicans said they saw russia s power and influence as a significant threat to the united states once again mr trump has flipped the script in the party of reagan a country that was once seen as a geopolitical foe is now embraced by many republicans as a bastion of christianity and traditional values michael mcfaul ambassador to russia during the obama administration said that despite the country s relative economic and military weakness mr putin had often played a poor hand deftly across many dimensions putin is using all kinds of instruments of power he said it feels to me the former ambassador said like he s winning and we re losing on july 16 the president woke early in helsinki hours before he was to sit face to face with mr putin the meeting came three days after mr mueller indicted the 12 russian intelligence officers once again mr trump dashed off a tweet our relationship with russia has never been worse thanks to many years of u s foolishness and stupidity and now the rigged witch hunt he wrote russia s foreign ministry responded with a simple tweet hours later we agree kitty bennett contributed research graphics by larry buchanan karen yourish derek watkins and denise lu
