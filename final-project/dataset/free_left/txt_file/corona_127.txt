advertisement supported by president trump initially said he might withhold federal funding for michigan and nevada if the states moved forward in expanding vote by mail though he later backed off that threat by reid j epstein nick corasaniti and annie karni washington president trump on wednesday escalated his assault against mail voting falsely claiming that michigan and nevada were engaged in voter fraud and had acted illegally and threatening to withhold federal funds to those states if they proceed in expanding vote by mail efforts the president inaccurately accused michigan of sending mail ballots to its residents as his aides later acknowledged and he offered no basis for his claims of illegal actions by either michigan or nevada the michigan secretary of state has sent ballot applications not the ballots themselves to registered voters a growing practice among election officials including in states led by republicans in nevada where the republican secretary of state declared the primary a nearly all mail election ballots are being sent to registered voters as most states largely abandon in person voting because of health concerns over the coronavirus mr trump and many of his republican allies have launched a series of false attacks to demonize mail voting as fraught with fraud and delivering an inherent advantage to democratic candidates despite there being scant evidence for either claim by day s end mr trump had corrected his tweet about michigan saying officials there had mailed applications not ballots though he continued to assert the secretary of state had acted illegally he also backed off his threat to hold back funding saying michigan would find out very soon if it s necessary according to a pool report from the white house i don t think it s going to be necessary mr trump has often made threats about cutting off funding to states but has not always followed through aides compared his wednesday morning tweets to previous attempts to withhold federal funds to sanctuary cities but his assault on the electoral process comes as republicans are spending millions of dollars on broad efforts that could suppress voting in heavily democratic areas in november particularly in battleground states like michigan and wisconsin republican controlled legislatures and g o p election lawyers around the country are trying to block or minimize widespread absentee voting and other measures that would make voting easier the efforts include recruiting volunteers to monitor polling places and challenge voters deemed suspicious which the g o p says are needed to prevent fraud but that democrats say are intended to suppress turnout in a bid to aid mr trump trump seems to think that anything that makes it easier for people to vote is going to hurt him said richard l hasen an election law expert at the university of california irvine and he s consistently expressed the view that anything that makes it easier to vote leads to voter fraud when there is absolutely no evidence to support that claim mr trump s first tweet wednesday targeted michigan a critical swing state that he won narrowly in 2016 michigan sends absentee ballots to 7 7 million people ahead of primaries and the general election the president wrote this was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue secretary of state i will ask to hold up funding to michigan if they want to go down this voter fraud path an hour later he made a similar threat against nevada saying the state had created a great voter fraud scenario and adding if they do i think i can hold up funds to the state his attacks continue a pattern of insinuations about voting fraud that cast doubt on the integrity of elections which some democrats worry are a prelude to potential efforts by republicans to dispute the outcome in november if mr trump loses the presumptive democratic nominee joseph r biden jr has suggested several times that he expects mr trump to disrupt or even seek to delay the november election michigan s secretary of state jocelyn benson quickly clarified on wednesday that the state is not mailing ballots to all michigan voters on wednesday she began mailing ballot applications to all registered voters i was notified about the tweet this morning and it caught me off guard because it of course was inaccurate ms benson a democrat said in an interview it is nothing different from what my republican colleagues in other states are doing it boggles my mind that this which is completely within my authority would in any way be seen as controversial ms benson said she had already spent 4 5 million to mail voters ballot applications using money from the federal cares act which congress passed to help states deal with the coronavirus she had previously sent absentee ballot applications to all voters for the state s local elections on may 5 mr trump s outbursts come as the white house and his re election campaign are confronting polls showing the president trailing mr biden both nationally and in key swing states kayleigh mcenany the white house press secretary dodged questions about what was illegal about michigan sending out ballot applications illegality and legality of it that s a question for the campaign ms mcenany said ms mcenany said only that there was evidence and bipartisan consensus on the fact that mass mail in voting can lead to fraud late wednesday a campaign spokesman tim murtaugh said president trump is correct there is no statutory authority for the secretary of state in michigan to send absentee ballot applications to all voters existing case law in michigan supports that conclusion as well a trump campaign official cited a 2008 michigan case in which a judge said local clerks could not send absentee ballot applications to a limited universe of voters a different set of circumstances michigan voters in 2018 passed a constitutional amendment expanding access to absentee voting anyone can now print and distribute absentee ballot applications ms benson said and the form is available online her spokesman jake rollow said mr murtaugh s claim is false the president s attack on nevada is particularly confounding given that the state s effort to switch to a nearly all mail election was made by secretary of state barbara k cegavske a republican democrats have sued ms cegavske to block her effort to close nearly all of the state s in person polling places for the june 9 primary and mail ballots to all registered voters if it has not become apparent yet donald trump makes stuff up said marc elias the democratic elections lawyer who is suing ms cegavske to require more in person polling places to remain open so i don t think he has a particular objection other than someone has told him that he is losing in michigan and in nevada so today he decided to tweet about michigan and nevada updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season

clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a

president is scheduled to visit a ford motor plant that is manufacturing ventilators in ypsilanti mich on thursday this is his first trip to the state since january and comes at a time when his campaign advisers are increasingly concerned about his chances there mr trump s tweets a day ahead of the trip were seen as unhelpful to boosting his political standing in a critical state and his political opponents immediately pounced on them william kristol a prominent conservative trump critic said on twitter that his group defending democracy together was buying air time in michigan ahead of the president s visit there to air a new advertisement in defense of safe and secure voting senior administration officials defended mr trump s deeper concerns about mail in voting even though the president himself voted by mail earlier this year in the florida primary for his part mr trump has been concerned by reports on fox news about potential fraud in nevada s vote by mail primary and reports that thousands of ballots were being sent to inactive voters aides said they said mr trump is not opposed to absentee ballots but believes that vote by mail has been abused to hurt republican candidates in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic states around the country have been expanding their vote by mail options georgia officials decided last month to send absentee ballot applications

understand the new law attacking mail voting carries significant risk for mr trump if republicans avoid the system in november said john pudner a conservative political operative pointing out that it could decrease the vote in some key demographics just looking at the senior vote in many states if there s a falloff in that if he loses a chunk of that and he loses florida he s in big trouble mr pudner said yet he said mr trump s repeated attacks on mail voting means it tends to be harder for independent thinking in the party on it alan blinder contributed reporting from atlanta advertisement
