 sanders tells clinton he s sorry o malley hammers away on guns and not surprisingly trump is mentioned by daniel strauss 12 19 2015 09 15 pm est updated 12 20 2015 12 40 pm est there were only three candidates on the stage in the latest democratic presidential debate but each had plenty of big moments as they argued about taxes on the middle class intervention abroad and the safety of their campaign data here are the most memorable important and explosive moments from saturday s abc news debate 1 sanders apologizes for data breach advertisement right out of the gate sen bernie sanders apologized for this week s data breach in which sanders campaign staffers improperly accessed voter data from hillary clinton s campaign and clinton accepted his apology yes i apologize sanders said not only do i apologize to secretary clinton and i hope we can work on an independent investigation i apologize to my supporters clinton said she was looking forward to moving beyond the scuffle by gabriel debenedetti i very much appreciate that comment bernie clinton said it is important that we go forward on this i know that you now have your data back and there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen now that we ve resolved your data we ve agreed on an independent inquiry we should move on because i don t think the american people are all that interested in this 2 clinton trump is isis best recruiter all the candidates pivoted to attack donald trump again and again during the debate repeatedly using him as a foil at one point clinton contrasted trump s rhetoric on fighting islamic terrorists with former president george w bush s repeated statements that the united states was not at war with all muslims george w bush has done this i give him credit clinton said before saying that trump is becoming isis best recruiter they are going to people showing videos of donald trump insulting islam and muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists 3 sanders raises iraq war vote on foreign policy after clinton defended instituting a no fly zone over syria sanders brought up clinton s vote to go to war in iraq over a decade ago to contrast their foreign policies our differences are fairly deep on this issue sanders said we disagreed on the war in iraq i say this with due respect i worry that secretary clinton is too much into regime change and too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences could be after bringing up iraq again as well as libya sanders continued yes we could get rid of syrian president bashar assad tomorrow but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit isis getting rid of dictators is easy but you have to think of what will come after clinton shot back with all due respect senator you voted for regime change in libya all of these are very difficult issues i know that i ve been dealing with that for a very long time 4 clinton u s where we need to be on isis clinton sounded an optimistic note on the country s ability to handle the threat of isis also known as the islamic state we now finally are where we need to be we have a strategy and a commitment to go after isis which is a danger to us as well as the region the comments followed talk about the challenge of syria i think it s fair to say assad has killed by last count about 250 000 syrians the reason we are in the mess we re in that isis has the territory it has is because of assad i advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when i was still secretary of state because i worried we would end up exactly where we are now and so when we look at these complex problems i wish it could be either or i wish we could say yes let s go destroy isis and let s let assad continue to destroy syria which creates more terrorists more extremists by the minute no we now finally are where we need to be 5 o malley thunders away on guns to contrast with opponents martin o malley jumped in talking over the moderators to hit both sanders and clinton on guns while touting his gun control record in maryland o malley called both of them inconsistent and squishy on the issue secretary clinton changes her position on this every election year o malley said look what we need is not more polls we need more principles he continued saying both clinton and sanders exemplified the flip flopping political approach of washington the other two democratic candidates didn t take that lightly whoa whoa let s tell the truth here sanders said with clinton adding yeah let s tell the truth here both said o malley misrepresented them with sanders touting his past campaigns in vermont and clinton ticking off her support for the brady bill and closing loopholes for gun sellers 6 clinton calls for gun control as part of terrorism response asked about how to handle the threat of domestic and lone wolf terrorism after the san bernardino california attack clinton brought gun control into the conversation if you only think about the coalition abroad you re missing the point because we need a coalition at home arming more people to do what i think is not the appropriate response to terrorism once again clinton hit out at trump i worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from republicans particularly donald trump is sending a message to muslims in the united states and around the world that there is a war against islam 7 clinton splits with new hampshire s governor on halting refugees asked about democratic new hampshire gov maggie hassan s call for the federal government to stop accepting syrian refugees clinton split with the popular governor who has endorsed clinton and is running for senate in 2016 a collection of awkward moments from the debate on saturday i don t think a halt is necessary clinton said instead saying that the screening process should be very tough but that did not mean keeping all refugees from coming to the u s we don t want to make it seem that we are turning into a nation of fear o malley joined in too saying there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees 8 o malley reminds everyone he s younger than clinton and sanders o malley went there during a discussion on dealing with assad and fighting isis the former maryland governor used his age as a campaign selling point clinton is 68 sanders is 74 and o malley is 52 may i offer a different generation s perspective on this o malley said sparking audible shock from the audience 9 we find out how sanders has fun as the debate moved deep into the weeds on the candidates various economic plans clinton vowed not to raise taxes on the middle class no middle class tax raises she said promising not to hike them on those making less than 250 000 sanders and o malley declined to make the same promise and sanders said clinton was abandoning the democratic party s social legacy disagreeing with fdr on social security disagreeing with lbj on medicare and how to fund large social programs sanders mentioned paid family leave as an issue worth funding with a broad based tax though clinton said she supported funding the proposal with taxes on the wealthy as the moderators kept the conversation going sanders quipped now this is getting to be fun 10 clinton disappears after the first break the debate resumed with one glaring difference clinton was missing from the stage as moderator david muir stalled for time while delivering the next question the cameras showed an empty center podium between sanders and o malley clinton walked back onstage to applause in the middle of that question i m sorry clinton said sounding slightly exasperated and sparking chuckles from the audience 11 everybody should clinton wriggled out of a question about her ties to big business with a laugh line when muir asked if corporate america should love clinton she replied everybody should the crowd laughed i have said i want to be the president for the struggling the striving and successful when the question turned to sanders would corporate america love a president sanders the vermont senator took a different route no i think they won t sanders said again sparking laughter i don t think i m going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from wall street 12 sanders gives king abdullah a shout out the king of jordan got his second mention of the week in a presidential debate but unlike chris christie in the gop debate sanders got his name right in making his case on how to fight isis and direct america s national security interests in the middle east the vermont senator gave a shout out to king abdullah ii of jordan sanders said he didn t believe in unilateral american action in the middle east pointing to abdullah and saying the king said we the muslims should lead the effort on the ground and i think he s absolutely right 13 the role of the first lady or gentleman clinton was asked whether her husband would take on the traditional role that first ladies have played if the former secretary of state and former president bill clinton make it back to the white house after praising first ladies that came before and after her the democratic front runner said i am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and things like that but clinton added that she would still go to her husband for advice in the same way that other presidents have with their spouses sanders praised clinton for redefining the role of presidential spouse and talked about his wife s work with youth while o malley said it was up to his wife whether she would continue her work as a district court judge in the event that he becomes president 14 many bothans died to bring us this broadcast clinton had the last word saturday night and her sign off was stranger than science fiction thank you good night and may the force be with you she said an homage to the release of the new star wars movie missing out on the latest
