there was a remarkable and telling exchange sunday morning between nbc s chuck todd and donald trump over the republican presidential frontrunner s much debunked claims about thousands of muslims in new jersey celebrating in the immediate aftermath of the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks here it is in close to its entirety it goes on and on but you get the idea trump s argument boils down to this i don t care what published fact checks say i have heard from people on twitter who tell me they saw the same thing i did trump uses the social media response he gets to the outrageous claims he makes as justification that those claims are correct that is of course ridiculous as chuck rightly notes many of the people who follow trump simply want to see the world as he sees it and function and yes men for him and even if they aren t simply looking to agree with trump the idea that anecdotal evidence offered by un vetted sources via twitter can or should be used to directly rebut stories written by reporters who went to these alleged parties after sept 11 and found little or nothing makes no sense yes i am well aware of the story that serge kovaleski wrote in the post following 9 11 go read our fact checker on the story and get the um facts about it trump is far from the first presidential candidate to use anecdotal evidence as fact during the 2012 campaign then minnesota rep michele bachmann repeatedly told the story of a woman who approached her on the campaign trail and insisted that the hpv vaccine caused mental retardation in her daughter bachmann used the story as evidence that the hpv vaccine was in fact broadly dangerous despite scads of scientific evidence that it wasn t trump appears to not grasp the difference between being a wealthy businessman and a leading contender to be the republican nominee for president in the former role popping off based on limited information or wrong information or a story someone told you that they heard from their uncle has a limited impact in the latter role popping off is far more dangerous you re running for president of the united states chuck who gets the difference told trump on sunday your words matter truthfulness matters donald trump has created a perfect circle of illogical logic facts are fungible the tweet from someone he has never met and never will meet about something he she allegedly saw on 9 11 carries the same weight as actual information gathered by reporters hewing to journalistic standards i don t have to tell you that down that path lies real danger update 7 27 a m monday also appearing on tv on sunday trump spokeswoman katrina piersonaddressed her boss s many inflated claims and his apparent mocking of a new york times reporter s physical disability which trump has denied doing here s the thing if you don t like mr trump then yes you re going to side with that part of the story pierson told cnn pierson also argued that denying thousands of muslims celebrated on 9 11 is essentially tantamount to denying there are radical muslims in the united states receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
