for jeb bush s campaign august was a cruel month donald trump s attacks on the former florida governor as a low energy politician were beginning to stick and the two were bickering over immigration the issue before the bush team was what to do about it some advisers argued for an aggressive response even to the point of challenging trump to some kind of one on one confrontation others resisted believing trump s candidacy was unsustainable while some cautioned against getting into a pigpen with a pig as one adviser recalled others described it as trying to wrestle with a stump those summer days crystallized the plight of a campaign that had begun with enormous expectations and extraordinary resources as the scion of one of america s dynastic political families sought to follow his father and brother to the presidency at what would become a crucial moment bush s team had no clear strategy for a rival who was beginning to hijack the republican party that the bush family had helped to build other than to stay the course set months earlier of telling bush s story to voters there was no consensus senior strategist david kochel said of the discussions about how to combat the threat of trump s candidacy other campaigns were wrestling with the same problems but as the front runner in the polls at the time bush would suffer more than the others on saturday night the candidacy that had begun with such promise ended quietly after a disappointingly weak fourth place finish in south carolina ever the gracious realist bush announced in his concession speech that he would end his campaign as trump continued to soar as the gop front runner i have stood my ground refusing to bend to the political winds he said whether jeb bush ever had a chance to win the republican nomination in a campaign year that proved so ill fitting for a rusty politician who preferred policy papers to political combat is a question that will be debated long after the 2016 race has ended donald trump channeled the worst fears frustrations and anxiety of voters but he also magnified those same feelings sally bradshaw bush s chief strategist and confidant said sunday in an email it would be difficult for any solutions oriented conservative to tackle trump in this environment much less one who was seen as having been so much a part of the establishment he was never going to be an angry guy and voters wanted angry mike murphy the chief strategist for bush s super pac right to rise explained what had happened this way on sunday our theory was to dominate the establishment lane into the actual voting primaries he said that was the strategy and it did not work i think it was the right strategy for jeb the problem was there was a huge anti establishment wave the establishment lane was smaller than we thought it would be the marketplace was looking for something different and we ll find out how that ends when we have a nominee the result is one of the most startling failures in the modern history of american politics the fall of the house of bush it is a human story about the struggles of one of the most successful former governors in america in his bid to become president like his father and brother set against the backdrop of one of the strangest political cycles the country has seen in years beyond underestimating the anger in the electorate three other problems led to bush s downfall first the candidate and his team misjudged the degree of bush fatigue among republicans aides said an internal poll conducted last fall showed discouraging news roughly two thirds of voters had issues with bush s family ties bush stuff was holding him back said one aide who saw the polling data we obviously knew it was an issue but even still the gap between it and other issues i don t think we thought it would be that big for jeb bush the challenge remains making it about jeb not bush second bush and his team miscalculated the role and power of money and traditional television commercials in the 2016 race during the first six months of 2015 bush raised more than 100 million most of it stockpiled in right to rise a strategy that seemed right at the time but came at the cost of not dealing with other pressing needs we didn t use that time to introduce him as a unique brand said vin weber an outside adviser we used it to raise money i don t want to say they made an obvious and clear mistake but in retrospect it was a mistake the aggressive fundraising came to be known as shock and awe an echo of the initial bombing of iraq by u s led forces before the 2003 invasion in the campaign context it could be read as code to other potential candidates to get out of the way but the prodigious fundraising of bush s broad network scared off no one as the bush campaign would learn every credible candidate today has a few billionaire friends who can enrich a super pac in the end all that money came to symbolize frustration rather than power third bush ran a campaign that whether deliberate or not was rooted in the past managed by loyalists who admired bush and enjoyed his confidence but who like the candidate found themselves in unfamiliar political terrain his advisers were convinced from the start that the more voters learned about what bush had done as governor of florida from 1999 to 2007 they would flock to him as their presidential candidate bush stubbornly held to that approach even as evidence mounted that it was out of step with voters doug gross a prominent iowa republican recalled meeting with bush in july 2014 in kennebunkport maine to talk about the impending campaign he definitely wanted to run he s always had it in him and knew this was his last chance gross said he was trying to figure out how to do it his own way i was struck by his obstinate avoidance of any political discussion he wanted to do it his way or no way in contrast to the doldrums of august 2015 july seemed a glorious time for the bush team early that month team jeb gathered in kennebunkport to celebrate that the campaign and two allied political committees had together raised nearly an unprecedented 120 million the numbers were made public as nearly 300 major bush fundraisers assembled to mingle with the bush family and campaign advisers guests were transported in black and red trolleys to walker s point the bush family compound the group gathered for a photo with former president george h w bush and barbara bush that evening bush touted the team s record fundraising as guests dined on lobster rolls and hamburgers at a luxury resort tucked among a forest of birch groves and balsam fir it was incredibly memorable to be there with several generations said jay zeidman a houston based investor who helped raise money from young professionals the next day the donors got briefings from senior bush aides including bradshaw campaign manager danny diaz and finance director heather larrison they laid out how the campaign planned to take on contenders such as sen ted cruz of texas sen marco rubio of florida and new jersey gov chris christie throughout there was little mention of donald trump that time jeb bush invited 300 top donors to his parents house none of us thought he would last the summer said one person who was in attendance at that moment however trump was already in the process of undermining bush s candidacy if bush had ever gone up against someone like trump it didn t show trump was a new and different kind of rival one given to personal insults rather than policy debates who monopolized media coverage and got away with provocative statements that would have sunk normal politicians after marching in two july 4 parades on a rainy saturday in new hampshire reporters asked bush about trump s claim that mexico was allowing immigrants to illegally cross into the united states it was one of the hundreds of times he would face such questions bush said absolutely he was offended by trump s rhetoric we re going to win when we re hopeful and optimistic and big and broad rather than grrrrrr he said literally growling just angry all the time that very night trump attacked bush as soft on immigration and took aim as well at bush s wife columba who was born in mexico and entered the country legally retweeting and then deleting a disparaging comment about her nothing however cut as close to the bone as trump s claim that bush was too low energy to serve as president the accusation was laughable until it began to stick trump s charge was in fact a proxy for a different and more difficult argument to combat that bush was neither strong nor edgy enough for a party seething with anger at the grass roots inside the bush trump melodrama decades of tension and discomfort nobody tapped into it for all the polling all the focus groups said theresa kostrzewa a north carolina lobbyist who raised money for the campaign the biggest thing they did was miss was just how angry the american electorate was and that trump would be their captain ahab bush s advisers would contest that claim they could see the anger they said the issue was what to do about it donors political operatives and big thinkers from around the country urged us to ignore trump for months bradshaw said there was no one in the news media or the operative class at the time who felt trump would ultimately be a serious contender for the nomination at the same time others feared that engaging trump was almost beneath bush and would thrust the candidate into a never ending game of charge countercharge jeb should be bigger than this another aide recalled thinking over at right to rise murphy sent a clear signal trump is not our fight right now if other campaigns wish that we re going to uncork money on donald trump they ll be disappointed murphy told the washington post in late august trump is frankly other people s problem at that moment the bush team s analysis showed that no trump voters were likely to shift their support to bush on sunday murphy said that attacking trump would only have benefited other candidates bush s campaign needed to consolidate the establishment lane while hoping that trump and cruz would sort out the competition among the anti establishment candidates bradshaw also dismissed complaints from some donors that she cut the candidate off from advice noting that bush long has been active on email bradshaw responded in a message by saying donors constantly gave conflicting advice attack trump don t attack trump smile more smile less you look like you are smirking i didn t tell people they were wrong not my style i did a lot of listening and i m sure there were things we could have done better but withholding info from the governor simply did not happen in our campaign for much of the autumn bush s engagement with trump was on again off again skirmish then turning away not until late last year did he truly start a concerted and sustained series of attacks aides said bush was particularly affected by the terrorist attacks in paris and san bernardino calif and felt as one adviser put it that it was time to stand up to the bully jeb was the only candidate with the political courage at the time and frankly throughout the last six months to take on trump directly for doing something that the governor felt was very harmful to the party and to the country bradshaw wrote there was no hesitation at that point given his comments about women about hispanics his lack of knowledge on issues of national security and on and on bush s failure to come to terms with one of the downsides of his family name came to a head over a four day period in may when he stumbled over the decision by his brother former president george w bush to go to war in iraq jeb bush faces hostile questions about iraq war changing his answer on a daily basis bush came across as a flat footed campaigner clearly uncomfortable articulating his views on the most critical moment of his brother s presidency but it also highlighted the double edged nature of being a candidate named bush in a january washington post abc news poll nearly 6 in 10 americans held an unfavorable view of bush he was the only republican with a negative favorability rating 44percent said they had a favorable impression of the former governor while 50percent rated him negatively his rankings grew worse as the campaign progressed a fundamental weakness supporters said was the lack of a coherent rationale for bush s candidacy and the failure to make inroads with activists on the right at the end of the day it wasn t clear the name was ever surmountable said a bush donor if the name was going to be surmounted it would have to be because there was a fresh set of ideas bush offered ideas but in a campaign dominated by trump they were ignored or lost to most voters one of the biggest tactical advantages bush appeared to have early on a richly endowed super pac was not the invincible weapon his team thought it would be it cut off his access to a key adviser murphy whom he installed at the group s helm it also meant that during the first six months of last year nearly all of the coverage about bush focused on how he was socking away millions into the super pac all while maintaining that he had not decided whether to run in an election brimming with anger toward the wealthy elite bush seemed almost flippant about his pursuit of big dollars murphy was convinced that much of what was taking place was noise and that when the voters began to check in the super pac s financial might would be overpowering first the committee would use it to lay out bush s biography then as necessary the group would turn its arsenal on his rivals our job is just to amplify his story and what he s saying and we banked enough cash that nobody s turning our speaker off murphy told bloomberg politics in october back at campaign headquarters the team hewed to that timetable and sensibility once the bush record was burned into voters minds attitudes would shift bradshaw said at the time a bush donor complained murphy had a timetable and nothing mattered until december and january by the end of january right to rise had raced through at least 95 7 million out of the 118 6million it had collected according to federal election commission filings almost 87million went into a barrage of television ads online videos slick mailers and voter phone calls to no avail mel sembler a former bush ambassador who helped raise money for the super pac and served on its governance board said he believes the group s strategy was sound we had confidence in mike and i think we did the best we could in deploying of resources sembler said that s not where the problem is the timing was not right for jeb our candidate was just not connecting with the electorate the final months were difficult for bush after a particularly weak performance during a debate in boulder colo in october in which rubio appeared to get the better of him there were suggestions that he might quit the campaign right then reporters who made inquiries about the possibility were brushed off in the middle of it all bush spotted a reporter who was a regular on the trail with him hey i didn t drop out did i he shouted you know that kind of stuff really gets my juices going i m going to win this thing and when i do you re going to give me a big hug through it all bush attempted to keep both good humor and determination in the face of the inevitable i was stunned by how well he handled the last month of this campaign when the writing was on the wall said tim miller bush s communications director it is hard to go out there every day and put on a fake smiley face he was in really high spirits and didn t lash out at people in private throughout the last two months the final indignity in a campaign that had suffered through many came three days before saturday s primary when south carolina gov nikki haley endorsed rubio rather than a man she described as a friend and mentor when it ended saturday night bush told saddened supporters we put forward details innovative conservative plans to address the mounting challenges that we face because despite what you might have heard ideas matter policy matters his final remarks as a presidential candidate were a reflection of the campaign he had constructed from the start one he had built to his unique specifications which nonetheless proved to be a mismatch for a political environment that caught him by surprise and for which he paid a hefty price
