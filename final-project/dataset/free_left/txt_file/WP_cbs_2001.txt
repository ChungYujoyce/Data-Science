following the food and drug administration s authorization of the antiviral drug remdesivir for emergency use as a coronavirus treatment new hope for an eventual end to covid 19 was ignited this week a recently completedstudyled by the national institutes of health found that remdesivir shortened the recovery time for some coronavirus patients by four days but questions still remain how exactly the drug will get to those that need it most as new models project deaths will surpass 100 000 nationally here s the big takeaways from sunday s episode of face the nation with margaret brennan he added i think what we re going to have in the fall is hopefully multiple manufacturers that have cleared early stage safety trials and have millions of doses that could be deployed in large scale studies inside cities and so what you would do is deploy the vaccine in the setting of an outbreak in a city to both test whether it s safe and effective will southwest have to lay off workers the demand is just not there so obviously if things don t improve we have to downsize we ve never had a furlough in our history we ve never had a pay cut in our history and i m extraordinarily proud of that and we certainly don t want to break that record what i promised our people is i don t know what the future holds but i do know that we re very well prepared said kelly why that matters the travel industry has suffered crippling losses as a result of the coronavirus but southwest air s ceo appears undeterred by the dire circumstances like much of small business america so too do major industries need to curtail or adjust their models to a new normal around the globe pritzker and other governments are asking the federal government for financial aid does he expect strings to be attached to financial aid for states i don t know whether there ll be strings attached i hope there aren t too many because the fact is every state has a problem and it s different in every state where they need to put the dollars so putting more strings on it makes it much more difficult for us to move forward to get our economies going so the federal government is really the only entity that can step in and help us out missed sunday s episode click here to watch the show face the nation airs sunday mornings on cbs clickhere for local listings margaret brennan is moderator of cbs news face the nation and cbs news senior foreign affairs correspondent based in washington d c watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
