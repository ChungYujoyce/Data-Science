advertisement supported by by michael barbaro and ashley parker brookline n h jeanne cleveland a retired teacher pursed her lips sourly at the mention of his name and tried to summarize her distaste in diplomatic terms i think he s arrogant she said i think he s rude i think she paused reaching for the right words let s just say i don t like the way he represents us as a country to avoid any confusion mrs cleveland put it plainly i don t like trump in this the 70 year old from hollis n h has ample baffled and agonized company in new hampshire as the presidential primary enters its final frenzied weeks with donald j trump remaining atop poll after poll of the state s republican electorate or is he so deep is the dislike for him in some quarters that people like mrs cleveland s husband doug question the accuracy of polls that so consistently identify mr trump as leading the field with around 32 percent i ve never met a single one of them mr cleveland said about those said to be backing mr trump where are all these trump supporters everyone we know is supporting somebody else these are the lamentations of the 68 percent the significant majority of republican voters here who are immune to mr trump s charms and entreaties according to a battery of voter interviews on thursday at campaign events for his rivals for months great quantities of ink political science brain power and polling resources have been expended trying to dissect if not exactly diagnose the trump phenomenon precisely who supports him and why far less energy has been devoted to sounding out a much larger segment of the electorate those who reject him from brookline to laconia these voters call mr trump unhinged they object to his temperament they doubt his motives their disapproval runs strikingly deep several spoke of changing the channel whenever his face or more frequently his new york accented voice via telephone turned up on television i really try not to watch him one resident paul brennan said as he walked out of an appearance by senator marco rubio of florida in a factory in brookline along new hampshire s southern border i wouldn t trust him as far as i could throw him trust is a nagging recurring issue among trump skeptics on some level they do not quite believe that he is really seriously running for president despite everything nor are they convinced that his republicanism is authentic they remember his donations to democratic candidates since disavowed as a business necessity and his support for abortion rights rationalized as trying to fit in with left leaning new yorkers charles bradley 67 a retired lawyer from laconia who calls himself conservative said he had lost count of mr trump s shifting allegiances and discarded positions he loves everybody until he doesn t love them if you ve noticed mr bradley said he loved ted cruz and now he doesn t anymore he loved hillary clinton and now he doesn t anymore but for the 68 percent no single attribute rankles as much as mr trump s instinctive proclivity to insult everyone over everything no matter how big or small the issue from mexicans to the fox news journalist megyn kelly his behavior i can t do it complained joan weaving 72 from hampton n h as she sat on a folding chair next to her husband at a jeb bush campaign event on thursday night belittling people just seeing the bad parts of things they may share his impatience with ordinary political speak with the hypersensitivity that has crept into american public life they admire his attempts to crack and peel away that veneer of politesse a look at the latest results for iowa and new hampshire and how this year compares to previous election seasons and as loyal republicans they mostly vow to coalesce around him should he seize their party s nomination a fact borne out in polls but they have limits barbara henry 63 wants a president who has a filter any filter he has no filter she said leaning forward to make her point i understand people say i m sick of this political correctness i get that she said but there s also an argument for some measure of civility i mean he s just not somebody who you can say i m proud he s our president several voters insisted they had tried hard to close their eyes and picture mr trump as the leader of the free world they could not do it they say he ll lose his cool when he gets up with putin or one of those and tell them to go fly a kite predicted kathy defreitas who lingered at a pizza parlor in manchester after listening to senator ted cruz of texas jim lowell 65 a retired navy commander served under commanders in chief so he felt qualified to assess applicants for the job i don t think he s presidential mr lowell said i don t think he has the experience i don t think he has the knowledge some voters interviewed said they wondered what exactly a president trump would do to make america great again few could pinpoint much of an agenda besides the wall in mr trump s abundant pronouncements i don t know and i m not sure he does to tell you the truth said mr bradley the retired lawyer mr trump s televised ubiquity has provided voters with an extraordinary amount of raw material from which to judge him or to make a trump diagnosis several voters offered their unsolicited medical opinions i do believe he suffers from megalomania said lorraine raleigh a 68 year old retired teacher from hampton ray weaving 75 charitably downgraded the condition ever so slightly egomaniac he said mr trump is fond of describing his followers as a silent majority but there is nothing quiet about his doubters whose frustration with him boils over at the campaign events of his rivals as mr bush campaigned at a veterans hall in manchester a few days ago jimmy kyriakoutsakos a local voter dedicated his allotted question not to national security or the plunging stock market but rather to stopping mr trump from becoming president i do not know how a carnival entertainer could be running the field and i m very disappointed in that he told mr bush mr bush wore the pained look of a man who has fielded the question before i try to avoid in these meetings to have a trump therapy session he said but then he played therapist anyway consoling the trump averse crowd amid their deep anxieties and doomsday predictions the 68 percent do concede that mr trump has deftly dominated the republican race tapped into the unseen fury of voters and turned once sleepy debates into must watch television he s very entertaining susan bunting said as she waited to hear gov john kasich of ohio speak in the lakeside town of wolfeboro a caveat quivered on the horizon but she said i don t want an entertainer for president advertisement
