advertisement supported by political memo by patrick healy it has been only three weeks since hillary rodham clinton declared her candidacy for the white house but she already looks more confident than she did during the almost 17 months of her last campaign sure no serious rival has yet emerged to get under her skin the way barack obama did in 2008 but mrs clinton and her team have also shown a determination not to be thrown off course not by the blowback on her use of personal email while at the state department not by reports critical of the clinton foundation and not by congressional investigations of the 2012 attacks in benghazi libya such flare ups used to make mrs clinton go cold and cautious now she is projecting a scandals be damned attitude and barreling ahead with her agenda in las vegas on tuesday she was unafraid to court controversy on an issue dear to her families and children by saying that she would go beyond president obama s executive action on immigration and try to protect tens of thousands of parents who are still facing deportation it was a vivid contrast to a low point in 2007 at a democratic primary debate when she avoided taking a clear stand on an issue that was similarly divisive among voters driver s licenses for illegal immigrants mrs clinton s embrace of citizenship for many illegal immigrants bold executive action and even those driver s licenses which she endorsed recently will allow her to play offense against republican candidates who are divided on immigration what she does not say is that she used to side with many republicans on some cultural and social issues she now sees a constitutional right to same sex marriage for instance after years of saying that marriage was only between a man and a woman it is not every day that a lawyer like mrs clinton discovers a new constitutional protection but democratic primary voters increasingly favor same sex marriage and she is determined to catch up with them it may be early to jump to any hillary unbound conclusions and she has yet to engage in any freewheeling back and forth with reporters but from her full throated speech last week about ending mass incarceration to her bullish decision on wednesday to court donors for a super pac mrs clinton has shown a new willingness to take stands that turn off some voters or interest groups this is a meaningful development mrs clinton twisted herself into knots during her last campaign when trying to mollify democrats over her iraq war vote without admitting any fault after spending 2007 and 2008 refusing to apologize for events in iraq she now seems increasingly capable of saying what liberals want to hear we are seeing a bolder and more confident candidate this time out said geoffrey garin a democratic strategist who worked on mrs clinton s first presidential bid as a result i think voters are getting a much better look at the real hillary clinton he continued at a similar point eight years ago the mind set of the clinton campaign was to be cautious and avoid rocking the boat mrs clinton s advisers who were sometimes accused of overkill in defending her in the 2008 contest are fighting back against opponents with a new tone and style intended to appear eminently reasonable her lawyers are trying to strike a compromise with representative trey gowdy the republican leading an investigation of the benghazi attacks to have her testify in public a clinton spokesman brian fallon appeared this week in a campaign video adopting a genial wally cleaver manner as he tried to eviscerate the new book clinton cash and the credibility of its author peter schweizer the steadier hand is particularly noticeable to old obama aides who recall mrs clinton as a more tactical than strategic minded opponent in 2008 her presidential campaign seems a lot less distracted by the day to day news stories than it was in 2008 said bill burton who was the press secretary for mr obama s first presidential campaign that means her ability to project a clear eyed focus on the american people is a lot more effective her near term strategy in the view of some republicans and political analysts is to catch up with the steady migration of many democratic primary voters to the left wing of their party secretary clinton has always run the campaign that she has politically calculated is the most advantageous for her at the time said tim miller a spokesman for jeb bush the former florida governor and a likely republican candidate she s making a tactical choice that her best chance at winning is to protect her left flank from a challenge and run a divisive general election campaign new opinion polls this week suggested that mrs clinton s approach was working especially among democrats americans now view her more favorably than they did earlier this year despite weeks of critical reports about her use of personal email and about donations to the clinton foundation according to a new york times cbs news poll four out of five democrats say she is honest and trustworthy and that she shares the values most americans try to live by one important challenge will be following up on her rhetoric with policy details after mrs clinton s remarks in las vegas on immigration the white house press secretary josh earnest said that president obama had used as much authority as he could to help parents and others facing deportation and appeared at a loss about what more mrs clinton might do clinton advisers said on wednesday that she wanted to try an additional approach of providing a new application process for some parents who are illegal immigrants to pursue a path toward citizenship it remains to be seen how this would work in practice and what positions mrs clinton will take on complex economic issues that she has barely begun to tackle but her allies in the democratic party seem grateful to have so much now on which to agree with her my sense is that she rightfully perceives a much better political landscape for her today than eight years ago said carter eskew a democratic political consultant who is not involved with her campaign then voters were looking for a clean break from president bush and she carried the burden of voting for the iraq war he continued in this cycle voters seem to be much more focused on candidates with confidence experience and perceived ability to get things done which have always been her greatest strengths unless republicans crack those they may find running against her very frustrating advertisement
