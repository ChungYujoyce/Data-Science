 congress republicans face a terrible senate map in 2016 but they re leveraging their cash advantage to pound democrats early by manu raju 08 24 2015 05 10 am edt updated 08 24 2015 12 53 pm edt five republican outside groups have already dropped a staggering 2 5 million blasting gov maggie hassan pictured gov maggie hassan isn t a senate candidate yet and it s not at all certain she ever will be but new hampshire television viewers may have a different impression five republican outside groups have already dropped a staggering 2 5 million blasting hassan an attempt to damage her standing and potentially even scare her away from what would be one of the nation s premier senate races on the other side in the granite state just one democratic outside group has put significant resources targeting gop sen kelly ayotte to the tune of a meager 255 000 advertisement the striking disparity underscores two realities of the emerging race for control of the senate in 2016 to keep the senate majority republicans plan to leverage what s expected to be a huge money advantage led by a hodgepodge of big spending outside groups to bloody democratic challengers taking on a string of vulnerable gop incumbents in pivotal swing states and hassan tops the list of potential challengers they re targeting without her in the race democrats face a much harder path back to the senate majority in 2016 on paper democrats are in prime position to make mitch mcconnell a one term majority leader republicans are on defense across the map with 24 incumbents trying to keep their seats versus just 10 for democrats only two democratic held seats sen michael bennet s in colorado and retiring minority leader harry reid s in nevada are seen as winnable for republicans at least seven gop controlled seats are at risk of flipping republicans currently have a 54 46 advantage so democrats need to pick up five seats or four if they win the white house and have the vice president to break a tie also on politico glenn thrush the problem is that despite that advantage democrats know full well they ll be outspent probably by a lot they re hoping the early attacks won t amount to much given that the election is more than a year away but party officials are increasingly anxious that their big ticket donors need to step up or risk seeing mcconnell remain as majority leader for the next two years we do need our people to get their skin in the game said one senate democratic strategist who asked not to be named to speak candidly about party donors across the country republican groups have already dropped more than 12 million compared with just 2 5 million from democrats according to media tracking sources it s far more cash than at a similar point in the 2012 cycle when groups from both sides had spent about 2 million each republican groups are wasting little time bashing democrats on issues as diverse as the iran nuclear deal and health care outside spending is the name of the game this cycle said sheila krumholz head of the nonpartisan center for responsive politics a group that tracks campaign financing senate candidates have an added challenge they re competing for airtime and coverage from a presidential race sucking up all the oxygen hurting their ability to bolster their name id some are moving to get their message out earlier as former sen russ feingold did in wisconsin with a radio ad wednesday that came after feingold had been whacked by a chicago area super pac called restoration pac that dropped 500 000 blasting his position on iran recognizing the likely disparity feingold has pushed his gop foe sen ron johnson to sign a pledge calling on all outside groups to stay out of his state but feingold refused to say in an interview last month whether all democratic groups should stay out of wisconsin no matter what republicans do a departure from past races and perhaps a sign of the times in some cases democrats say that fundraising has started off sluggishly because of donor fatigue and frustration following the gop romp in the 2014 midterms also on politico marc caputo and anna palmer the biggest spending democratic outside group senate majority pac raised just 1 3 million through june compared with about 3 million during a comparable period in 2013 but the committee was active in early 2013 to defend the senate seat vacated by john kerry in massachusetts officials expect senate majority pac to post bigger numbers in the next round of filings especially now that reid who was sidelined with an eye injury at the beginning of the year is ramping up his fundraising for the group and recently the group received multimillion dollar commitments from wealthy donors sources said republicans are running scared said shripal shah a spokesman for senate majority pac that s why they re already spending so much so early to try to shore up endangered incumbents the early spending by super pacs which are allowed to receive unlimited sums of cash from donors has given more breathing room to traditional party committees like the democratic senatorial campaign committee and national republican senatorial committee allowing them to raise funds for now and preserve their cash to spend when the election season ramps up sen michael bennet s seat in colorado is one of only two democratic held seats seen by republicans as winnable getty this year early spending has often come from obscure gop aligned groups one nation pac a group tied to karl rove s american crossroads has dropped six figures into states like north carolina and pennsylvania to prop up sens richard burr and pat toomey respectively in the pivotal race in ohio several republican outfits including traditional gop aligned groups like the u s chamber of commerce have spent several million dollars to help rob portman against his likely democratic opponent ted strickland in pennsylvania where there are two democratic candidates vying for their party s nomination to face off against toomey 1 9 million has been already spent on the republican s behalf and that s a shade less than the money that s been spent to help ayotte even though the first term senator doesn t even have an opponent yet the 57 year old hassan a second term new hampshire governor is expected to make a decision this fall about whether to run for the seat once she concludes a messy budget fight with the state legislature but americans for prosperity the outfit founded by the koch brothers has already spent roughly 1 2 million on tv there roughing her up for her budget policies levi russell spokesman for afp said the attack is consistent with the group s efforts to regularly bring grass roots pressure to elected leaders pushing them to support pro growth free market policies afp is hardly alone on the gop side an obscure indiana group impact america action spent another 684 000 slamming hassan for her spending problem in a hard hitting ad justin barasky a dscc spokesman said the ad buys show gop senators like ayotte are special interest lap dogs in response nrsc spokeswoman andrea bozek said democrats don t have the resources to recruit quality candidates into states obama won in many ways the gop playbook in new hampshire emulates how democrats went after former sen scott brown who moved from massachusetts to challenge sen jeanne shaheen in the granite state s 2014 senate race for months democratic groups bashed brown as he was toying with a potential run driving up voter antipathy toward the republican who eventually lost by 3 points also on politico michael crowley similarly a university of new hampshire poll from july found ayotte leading by 6 points against hassan in a potential matchup an uptick from a may poll that found the republican ahead by just 2 points perhaps for that reason senate majority pac released its first ad of the cycle earlier this month a 255 000 ad buy slamming ayotte for her position on tax breaks for oil companies how the air war is affecting hassan s thinking is uncertain marc goldberg a senior adviser to the governor said she s focused on the state budget and there is no timetable for any decisions related to 2016 correction an earlier version of this story described hassan as a first term new hampshire governor she is in her second two year term correction corrected by jennifer shutt
