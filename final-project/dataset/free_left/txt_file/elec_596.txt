with the coronavirus the right action looks like an overreaction as it s happening as the harms of social distancing become more and more apparent americans may start to wonder are we overreacting to the coronavirus pandemic a few people although not most of the public seem to think so some federal officials from president donald trump to rep andy biggs r az have asked if the cure is proving worse than the disease itself protesters in several states including michigan ohio and kentucky have called for lockdowns to end arguing that the damage to the economy is too much to bear this is a question public health experts and officials expected from the start as kent state university epidemiologist tara smith told me it s the paradox of public health when you do it right nothing happens the problem with proper prevention the linchpin of many public health strategies is that there s no clear indication when it works there s no public celebration when a coronavirus case or death doesn t happen and in the meantime the economic damage of closing down america is readily apparent some economists warn that the unemployment rate could surpass 30 percent about 22 million have filed unemployment claims since social distancing measures took effect in march the lines for food aid are stretching for blocks across the country it s now much more difficult if not impossible to visit family and friends and partake in many favorite hobbies and activities in other words the benefits of social distancing aren t very visible while the pain from it is that creates a situation in which it can be easy to take for granted that social distancing is according to experts and models likely preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths in the united states but it s important to remind ourselves what we re doing here the us wants to avoid getting to the point where it s obvious we did something wrong and need to correct course we want to prevent what happened in italy spain or new york from happening across the country that means reacting not just to what s visible to us in the present but what s potentially in the future doing that will always at some level seem like an overreaction even if it s the right call related anytime you are dealing with an outbreak if it appears like you overreacted then you probably did the right thing krutika kuppalli a fellow in the johns hopkins center for health security emerging leaders in biosecurity program told me that s particularly true for coronavirus there s still a lot we need to learn about the virus but we do know it seems to spread at least in part through people who aren t showing any symptoms that means it can be spreading in communities without anyone not even the people who are infected knowing it that requires taking action before the virus is clearly visible at least without mass testing in a community there s also evidence from past outbreaks particularly the 1918 flu pandemic that reacting quickly and aggressively even before a disease clearly poses a threat is crucial both to saving lives and in the long term potentially keeping the economy intact yes it demands a shared sacrifice at this time but it s worth it the alternative that we let up to millions of people including our friends family and peers die is so bad we need to do everything we can to prevent it it s true that we still don t know enough about the sars cov 2 the novel coronavirus that can seem like a reason to not do much maybe the virus isn t as contagious or as deadly as we think it is maybe it ll die down in the summer with warmer weather maybe only specific segments of the general population are really vulnerable that s all possible but remember even if all of this and more turns out to be true in the future the reality is we simply don t know that now and didn t know it before we have to act with the best information we have and that information suggests the coronavirus is really bad whether it s a huge outbreak in wuhan china that forced the country to lock down the outbreak in italy that overwhelmed its health care system or the outbreak in new york that has turned the us into the world s leader in reported cases and deaths with more than 694 000 and 31 000 respectively as of april 18 and both figures are likely underestimates we also know that the coronavirus can spread from people who don t have symptoms yet or will never develop significant symptoms that could mean the disease is less deadly than we think if there are a lot more asymptomatic carriers than we realize it could mean a way smaller fraction of the people who are infected are dying but it also means that the virus can spread before it s clearly visible in a community that s been particularly exacerbated by america s poor testing capacity a result of both poor pandemic preparedness generally and president trump s slow reaction to the outbreak leaving the country unable to quickly test people to see if there s asymptomatic spread as a result we actually underreacted to covid 19 and have continued doing so by failing to scale up testing your chance of the first case being the one that comes to your attention is very very very very small george rutherford an epidemiologist at the university of california san francisco told me by the time you have the first death you have to figure that there s been three full weeks of transmission and there are at least several hundred cases in the population so once a city state or country is reporting a few covid 19 cases and especially deaths it s typically safe to assume there is a much bigger outbreak going on just one that s not fully visible at least yet to the public given that coronavirus cases and deaths can double every few days it s important for the public and officials to act quickly and preemptively to stop exponential growth it s in this context that it s so important that countries act though it can feel like an overreaction if you wait until there are already a bunch of cases or deaths in your community it could be too late to prevent an outbreak that even extreme social distancing might be unable to get under control for weeks consider the stories of california and new york california actually reported some of the first coronavirus cases and deaths in the country including the first case of community transmission but now new york has 14 times the covid 19 deaths as california there are important differences between the states such as new york city s much higher population density and greater public transportation use it s also possible new york just got unlucky there s the possibility that there were just more introductions of the virus in the east coast in the new york area jeffrey martin an epidemiologist at the university of california san francisco told me but one likely contributor is that california particularly the san francisco bay area reacted quicker to the outbreak the bay area issued america s first shelter in place order on march 16 and california issued a statewide stay at home order three days later while new york didn t until march 22 even before the government mandates some parts of california seemed to adopt social distancing early restaurant data from opentable suggests that seated dining on march 1 was down 2 percent in new york city but it was down 18 percent in san francisco though it was only down by 3 percent in los angeles so not every place in california acted the same the extra days and weeks may not seem like that much time but when coronavirus cases and deaths can double every few days that short time span can be important with this virus days and even hours matter jen kates director of global health and hiv policy at the kaiser family foundation told me it could have been easy at the time to make the case that california and particularly the bay area were overreacting given that the entire state had fewer than 25 deaths when it locked down but it ultimately seems like it was the right decision while there s a lot about the coronavirus and the nature of this outbreak that we still don t know research from the 1918 flu pandemic which was linked to as many as 100 million deaths globally and about 675 000 deaths in the us provides some useful evidence for strong early action a 2007 study in pnas found the places that took quicker action on social distancing closing schools and banning big public gatherings saw better outcomes c ities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates 50 lower than those that did not and had less steep epidemic curves cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic also showed a trend toward lower cumulative excess mortality but the difference was smaller 20 and less statistically significant than that for peak death rates one example cited in the study is the difference between philadelphia which was slow to act and st louis which was faster as this chart shows st louis did a much better job of flattening the curve and averting excess deaths another 2007 study published in jama validated the findings showing places that acted earlier and more aggressively saved lives but this study also demonstrated the importance of sustaining social distancing measures when cities including st louis pulled back their measures too quickly they saw a spike in deaths here s how that looks in chart form with the line chart representing excess flu deaths and the black and gray bars below showing when social distancing measures were in place the highest peak comes after social distancing measures were lifted with the death rate falling only after they were reinstated this did not just happen in st louis analyzing data from 43 cities the jama study found this pattern repeatedly across the country howard markel an author of the study and the director of the university of michigan s center for the history of medicine described the results as a bunch of double humped epi curves officials instituted social distancing measures saw flu cases fall then pulled back the measures and saw flu cases rise again notably the second rise in deaths only appeared when cities removed social distancing measures the jama study found among the 43 cities we found no example of a city that had a second peak of influenza while the first set of nonpharmaceutical interventions were still in effect while invoking social distancing is often presented as a choice between saving lives and sustaining the economy there s also some preliminary evidence that the early aggressive actions help the economy in the long term as well dylan matthews covered a recent study along these lines for vox economists sergio correia stephan luck and emil verner released a working paper not yet peer reviewed last week that makes this argument extremely persuasively the three analyzed the 1918 1919 flu pandemic in the united states as the closest though still not identical analogue to the current crisis they compare cities in 1918 19 that adopted quarantining and social isolation policies earlier to ones that adopted them later their conclusion we find that cities that intervened earlier and more aggressively do not perform worse and if anything grow faster after the pandemic is over the basic problem is that a lot of people getting sick and dying is also pretty bad for the economy potentially worse than temporarily shutting the economy down the risk for us now by believing we might be overreacting to the coronavirus pandemic is thinking we can ease up on measures doing it and subsequently seeing a spike in covid 19 cases and deaths in fact that already appears to be happening in some parts of the world asian countries that initially contained the outbreak such as south korea and singapore are now reporting signs of a second wave of cases after easing some of their restrictions none of this completely eliminates the possibility that we are overreacting maybe a year or two from now we ll realize that we didn t have to close down certain parts of the country or maybe certain segments of the population could have remained at their jobs or maybe the warmer temperatures could slow the virus s spread more than we think though heat hasn t been enough in singapore where it s currently 80 plus degrees fahrenheit we just don t know but as public health experts have told me it d be much better to end up second guessing ourselves about whether we overreacted than whether we underreacted and maybe caused the deaths of millions because that s the risk right now based on the best evidence we have support vox s explanatory journalism every day at vox we aim to answer your most important
