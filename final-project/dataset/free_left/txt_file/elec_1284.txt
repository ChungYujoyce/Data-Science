advertisement supported by the 2016 race by nate cohn one of saturday s biggest election surprises was the entrance and exit polling measuring hispanic voters in the nevada caucus it found that bernie sanders defeated hillary clinton by eight percentage points among hispanic voters overturning months of conventional wisdom about mrs clinton s strength among nonwhites but there are a lot of reasons to question the findings from the polls they have a small sample of precincts and voters and they simply were not devised to provide precise estimates of the hispanic vote the actual election returns in las vegas s clark county hint at a different story analyzed neighborhood by neighborhood they suggest that mrs clinton might have won the hispanic vote by a comfortable margin she won about 60 percent of delegates in heavily hispanic areas a result that calls the finding of the polling into question there is not much evidence though that mrs clinton won hispanic voters by the sort of landslide margin that she did eight years ago that s a good sign for mr sanders who needs to make up for the huge swing among black voters who have gone from uniformly for president obama to uniformly for mrs clinton but the finding that mr sanders won the hispanic vote is at best extremely questionable and at worst wrong the hispanic vote in nevada is overwhelmingly concentrated in clark county home to las vegas in particular hispanic voters are concentrated on the east side of the city where they make up the vast majority of the population but only a slight majority of registered democrats for a rough map see this tweet in the 76 precincts in clark county where we believe that a plurality of registered democrats are hispanic mrs clinton defeated mr sanders in the delegate count by a margin of 58 percent to 42 percent in the smaller number of majority hispanic precincts she seemed to win about 60 percent of the delegates and she won perhaps 65 percent of the delegates in the precincts where hispanics appeared to be a particularly large share of registered democrats for details on the estimates see my note at the end of the article similarly it was widely reported that mrs clinton fared extremely well in the precincts along the las vegas strip brian fallon the clinton campaign press secretary tweeted that the campaign estimated that mrs clinton won 61 percent of the vote in hispanic precincts throughout the state does that prove the entrance polls were wrong as mr fallon said not on its own it s dangerous to infer much about the preferences of a demographic group based on the results of the areas where they live hispanic voters who live in majority hispanic areas might be particularly likely to support mrs clinton in other words focusing only on the places where hispanic voters are most prevalent could provide a misleading picture of hispanic voters over all we know that this is an issue in other contexts similar analysis would overestimate the democratic share of the vote among hispanic voters or the republican vote among white voters a democratic pollster unaffiliated with either campaign said that mr sanders does better among nonwhite voters in areas where whites represent a larger share of the population which would suggest that a precinct based analysis would understate mr sanders s strength there s another problem there were relatively few homogeneous precincts where almost all of the voters are hispanic even the majority hispanic precincts in nevada have large numbers of non hispanic voters who themselves could have been likelier to support mrs clinton though the findings still hold if one excludes the precincts where there appear to be an above average number of black voters who favored mrs clinton by a wide margin but it is a stretch to say that mr sanders could have done so well among hispanic voters in non hispanic areas that he overcame a deficit in relatively hispanic areas where a large proportion of the hispanic population lives precinct data isn t perfect but i would take it over this entrance exit poll in general entrance exit polls are not well suited to measure the hispanic vote this one is particularly problematic over all the poll included just 1 024 respondents and just 213 hispanic respondents in a normal poll that would imply a margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points but these types of polls are not normal the margin of error is even higher at 7 percent and the true error can easily be much higher that s because an entrance exit poll isn t a random sample of the population like a normal poll it s a random sample of precincts usually between 15 and 60 in a state exit poll this one had just 25 precincts race is not usually used as a criteria for selecting precincts precinct selection introduces a whole new dimension of error into an entrance exit poll for hispanic voters or any demographic group that s concentrated in small areas the 25 precincts could overrepresent an unrepresented group imagine if a new york exit poll by chance included two orthodox jewish precincts in brooklyn and showed a republican ahead among jewish voters or completely miss a small geographically concentrated group you can imagine how this could wind up creating the opposite risk of the precinct analysis what if the entrance exit poll simply doesn t include a heavily hispanic precinct where mrs clinton excelled the danger is real with a sample as small as this especially in a highly diverse state this type of problem is responsible for one of the biggest exit poll controversies in memory the finding that 44 percent of hispanic voters supported george w bush in 2004 simply by chance 3 of the 11 plurality hispanic precincts were in miami dade county where hispanic voters are particularly conservative the 44 percent finding was four points higher than the result from a compilation of the 50 state exit polls a difference well outside the formal margin of error for a sample of that size the exit pollsters are upfront about the issue as they acknowledged in the exit poll s postelection analysis in 2004 a national sample of 250 precincts can do a good job estimating all of the broad characteristics of the electorate but it is not designed to yield very reliable estimates of the characteristics of small geographically clustered demographic groups if we want to improve the national exit poll estimate for hispanic vote or asian vote jewish vote or mormon vote etc we would either need to drastically increase the number of precincts in the national sample or oversample the number of hispanic precincts and that s for a national exit poll of 10 times as many precincts as the one in nevada the exit polls have also been criticized for other issues measuring hispanic voters like whether pollsters conduct spanish language interviews they generally do not although spanish language questionnaires are typically offered in nevada and other states with large hispanic populations in a december interview joe lenski who runs the exit polls for edison research acknowledged that exit polls are not the precise measurement of demographics that people would want them to be he said that he cringes when people say oh that s the number and run with it as absolute truths or precise numbers referring specifically to the nevada results mr lenski added that there are additional errors with caucus and entrance polls the entrance poll measures initial preferences those can change at the caucus and uncommitted is an option that received 3 percent support in initial preference the delegate tallies don t necessarily line up with actual vote counts either the delegates are allocated only after candidates get 15 percent of the vote in other words a candidate could win 60 percent of the delegates without winning 60 percent of the vote there were signs of problems saturday in poll results themselves mrs clinton and mr sanders were tied in the initial entrance exit poll estimates she ultimately won by around 5 5 points clearly the entrance polls missed mrs clinton s strength somewhere is it possible that the precincts missed mrs clinton s strength among hispanic voters in clark county quite possibly even the final entrance exit poll numbers show mrs clinton leading in clark county by just 5 points she actually won there by 10 points it s tough to give a poll subsample of some 200 respondents much weight especially when it s for a clustered group like hispanics it s even harder to give it credit when there s so much reason to wonder whether it s right mrs clinton fared well in majority hispanic precincts national polls show mrs clinton faring well among hispanic voters and mr sanders basically finished in line with national polls among both white and black voters all evidence considered and although we can t know for sure i d err on the side of a clinton win among hispanic voters but it would be hard to argue that she won hispanic voters by a lot sixty percentage points could easily be too high if she indeed fared better among hispanic voters in non hispanic areas the entrance exit poll result may not be perfect but it certainly seems consistent with this possibility if i had to bet i d say she won hispanic voters by a somewhat more modest margin it would still imply that mr sanders made big gains over the last month but it would still be short of what he would need to overcome mrs clinton s vast strength among black voters she won them by a huge margin whether you look at the entrance exit polling or majority black precincts in assessing delegate counts the estimates used are not perfect they were based by matching visually the precinct results reported by the nevada democratic party to estimates of the racial composition of registered democrats from l2 a nonpartisan voter file vendor even if the matching effort was perfect the estimates of the racial composition of registered democrats would not be they are based on the racial composition of census tracts and the surnames of voters the data is often used for analysis of latino voting trends including by the firm latino decisions the l2 data shows that 23 percent of registered democrats in nevada are hispanic a hair above the exit poll estimates for the caucus vote advertisement
