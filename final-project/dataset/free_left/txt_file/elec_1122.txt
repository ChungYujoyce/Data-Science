donald trump s campaign managers at keeping the candidate comparatively on message but even she has to sleep perhaps that is why the republican presidential nominee left unsupervised in the small hours of the morning thought it would be a good idea to fire off a series of explosive tweets between 3 20 a m and 5 30 a m attacking former miss universe alicia machado as disgusting questioning her citizenship and instructing his followers to check out her sex tape https twitter com realdonaldtrump status 781788223055994880 machado became a central figure in the presidential campaign during the first presidential debate four days earlier when hillary clinton described how the venezuelan actress now a u s citizen was mocked and humiliated by trump after winning the miss universe pageant in 1996 trump who owned the pageant forced her to exercise in front of the press after she gained weight allegedly calling her miss piggy and miss housekeeping because she was latina clinton said the next day machado appeared in a campaign ad for clinton recounting her story like his feud with the khan family trump has struggled to counter machado s allegations without making the scandal worse trump has proved time and again that he is constitutionally incapable of allowing slights to go unanswered particularly when they come from women even when they have zero strategic value so on tuesday the billionaire doubled down on fat shaming machado defending his insults by insisting during an interview on fox and friends that her weight was a real problem i know that person and she was a miss universe person and she was the worst we ever had the worst the absolute worst she was impossible she was a miss universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as miss universe she was the winner and you know she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem we had a real problem not only with that but her attitude and we had a real problem with her so hillary went back through the years and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother teresa and it wasn t quite that way but that s o k hillary has to do what she has to do elsewhere trump s allies and surrogates were grimacing publicly telling the media that they hoped trump would stop talking about machado and with less than six weeks remaining until election day go back to talking about the issues ben carson mused aloud that trump needed to disregard that and refocus while conway went on the view to say that she did reprimand trump for his comments machado herself has openly acknowledged her history recently resurfaced by several right wing outlets who dug up old reports that her daughter s father was a mexican drug kingpin and that she was accused of being involved in an attempted murder in 1998 she later allegedly threatened the life of the judge who had issued a warrant for her then boyfriend no charges were ever filed against machado according to politico as for the alleged sex tape it appears that trump is referring to video of her purportedly hooking up with a fellow contestant on la granja a spanish language reality television show a widely circulated excerpt from an actual pornographic video claimed to star machado but the daily beast reported that this was not the case after reviewing the tape machado who admitted that she was no saint girl in the past nonetheless dismissed trump s attacks as cheap lies and slander in an instagram post where she appears draped in the american flag in a further statement on facebook machado continued to denounce the republican nominee whom she has accused of traumatizing her when she was in miss universe this of course is not the first time the candidate insists on discrediting someone or insists on demoralizing women minorities and people of certain religions through his hateful campaign this is definitely one of his most frightful characteristics clinton having successfully baited trump into first defending his fat shaming of machado and then revealing a prurient interest in her sex life called her opponent unhinged friday on twitter what kind of man stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories she asked alicia deserves praise for courageously standing up to trump s attacks and he has the gall to blame her and say he helped clinton continued referring to trump s claim to have saved machado s job by forcing her to lose weight when something gets under donald s thin skin he lashes out and can t let go this is dangerous for a president after a few hours trump tweeted back lamely a t least you know i will be there awake to answer the call but the damage has been done instead of preparing for his next debate with clinton trump is now into the fifth day of a feud with a woman who represents nearly all of the demographic groups that he has offended women latinos immigrants with a dash of fat shaming and sexual slander to boot instead of letting the issue rest as his advisers have begged him to do trump has escalated bringing attention to his long history of demeaning and objectifying women now enraged trump is threatening to make clinton s husband s infidelities a central part of their next debate another self destructive attack that will almost certainly boost public sympathy for hillary while putting his own long public history of marital indiscretions under the microscope the clinton campaign couldn t have engineered a more brilliant masterstroke will be used in accordance with our privacy policy trump allegedly
