the big idea bill clinton spent 13 minutes yesterday forcefully responding to black lives matter activists who were heckling him speaking in an overwhelmingly african american neighborhood of philadelphia the city that will host this summer s democratic national convention the former president offered a spirited defense of his record on civil rights his signature crime bill and his wife one of the protesters held a sign that declared black youth are not super predators that s a reference to when hillary clinton spoke in 1996 of the kinds of kids that are called super predators and said we have to bring them to heel clinton pointed to the signs this is what s the matter he said i don t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13 year olds hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other african american children maybe you thought they were good citizens she didn t you are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter tell the truth you are defending the people who caused young people to go out and take guns the 69 year oldwent on an extended riff about why he and his wife are the ones who have really fought to make black lives matter because of that crime bill we had a 25 year low in crime a 30 year low in the murder rate and because of that and the background check law a 46 year low in deaths of lives by gun violence he said and who do you think those lives were that mattered whose lives were saved that mattered bill noted that hillary unlike bernie sanders did not vote for the crime bill she was spending her time trying to get health care for poor kids he said who were they and their lives matter he also highlighted the democratic front runner swork for the children s defense fund as a young attorney in alabama and her work to stop the spread of hiv in africa as secretary of state i ll tell you another story about a place where black lives matter africa he said watch the full exchange here in a year when the drama has mostly been on the republican side it made for great political theater and it gave bill clinton another unforgettable sister souljah moment in may 1992 the hip hop artist suggested that killing white cops might not be so bad in the wake of the los angeles riots speaking at a convention organized by jesse jackson s rainbow coalition the then governor of arkansas ripped into her if you took the words white and black and reversed them you might think david duke was giving that speech he said we have an obligation all of us to call attention to prejudice whenever we see it c span s archive has the video calling her out became legendary and helped clinton pivot from the democratic nominating contest he was wrapping up when he needed base voters to the general election when he needed independents twenty four years later we are at a very similar phase in the campaign cycle yesterday s showdown in philadelphia quickly became a rorschach test republicans and liberal activists inclined to dislike wjc called it evidence of him being out of touch and over the hill while clinton loyalists said it was the big dog at his best the majority of the crowd of 400 cheered clinton as he made the protesters his foils mostmainstream media outlets arecoveringthe comments as another off message embarrassment for his wife s campaign butlet s dispenseonce and for all with thefiction that bill clinton does not know what he s doing he knows exactly what he s doing from contrite to defiant a year ago most d c pundits would have bet that the 2016 general election would pit hillary versus jeb and that democrats could win by making the campaign about whether voters wanted to give bill or w a third term the bushes are now long gone indeed both donald trump and ted cruz criticize the former president to varying degrees because the democratic primaries turned out to be more competitive than anticipated it s been hard for the clintons to lean on nostalgia for the 1990s instead the former president and first lady have been pressed constantly from the left on everything from nafta to doma bill s comments about the black lives matter movement suggest that a major pivot in the campaign s messaging is on the way smarting from the 2008 defections of african americans to barack obama and recognizing that securing the democratic nomination this time would depend on running up the score among minority voters the clintons set out in the spring of 2015 to inoculate themselves from criticism over the crime bill we overshot the mark bill wrote in the foreword to a book on mass incarceration that came out exactly one year ago the same month hillary gave a speech at columbia university in the wake of the baltimore riots to promise that criminal justice reform to end sentencing disparities which were made worse by her husband s bill would be a top priority as president last july the former president told the naacp convention that he deeply regretted sending minor criminals to prison for way too long i signed a bill that made the problem worse and i want to admit it he said yesterday the former president instead blamed congressional republicans for the parts of the law that have increased mass incarceration he said then sen joe biden told him it could not pass if the tough on crime provisions were not added in after hillary was confronted this february by a protester about the super predator comment she expressed regret looking back i shouldn t have used those words and i wouldn t use them today she said in a statement now as the general election looms polls show that his wife is badly underperforming with white voters in key battleground statescompared to 2008 but bill s strategy is not without risk hillary needs high african american turnout to beat bernie in new york on april 19 and in the pennsylvania and maryland primaries on april 26 she also needs to keep the obama coalition activated through november while you were sleeping bernie sanders is going to speak at the vatican next week john wagner scoops he ll leave forrome immediately after his debate with clinton onapril 14 foraconference on social economic and environmental issues sanders turned his stump speech into comedy on the late show with seth meyers the vermont senator offered a comedic twist on his disdain for the billionaire class roasting the one percenters alongside meyers on a segment called ya bernt one percent what do you need all that money for sanders asked if i didn t know any better i d think you were trying to compensate for something as for the big banks sanders had this to say my advice is the same advice i give to a couple contemplating an open relationship it s time to break up john wagner colorado gov john hickenlooper who could be a contender in the veepstakes hosted hillary for a fundraiser at his home in denver last night isaac slade lead vocalist for the fray performed for the 530 attendees a white noise machinewas

according to anap gfk poll and the negativity transcends typical voter blocs of age raceand ideology it s an opinion shared by majorities of men and women young and old conservatives moderates and liberals and whites hispanics and blacks a devastatingly broad indictment of trump the numbers also suggest trump could be losing his core base in the south a region where trump has decisively won many primary contests close to 70 percent of voters view him unfavorably and among white voters without a college education 55 percent have a negative opinion not ready to make nice ted cruz refusesto apologize to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell for publicly calling him a liar last year that ain t gonna happen the texas senator said on cnn last night and if the washington lobbyists want to see that happen they can hold their breath a long long time so much for trying to win over his senate colleagues american idol is finallyover less than two months after the curtain went down on

social media after trent harmon a self described white dude from mississippi defeatedla porsha renae a black single mother from the same state justin wm moyer get smart fast trump shakes up campaign after getting caught flat footed in delegate hunt trumpannounced yesterdaythat he is reorganizing his campaign giving an expanded role to veteran strategist paul j manafort fromkarentumulty and dan balz manafort who joined the trump operation on march 29 as its convention manager will now have broader responsibilities and will oversee manage and be responsible for all activities that pertain to mr trump s delegate process and the cleveland convention the campaign said in its announcement manafort working from a new d c campaign office will also be in charge of outreach efforts to members of congress the republican national committee and think tanks while the campaign insisted there had been no reduction in the role of embattled campaign manager corey lewandowski it was nonetheless seen that way in republican circles manafort s new portfolio is the operation that could be most crucial to trump s success in the coming months said one gop strategist who has worked with manafort and who declined to be identified i can assure you that lewandowski should be looking for new employment at this point he s half wiped out already trump is not a dumb man chris cillizza writes he didn t get to where he is by not grasping when things are slipping away from him t he writing appears to be on the wall manafort will run things going forward smart frame the strategist vs the showman cruz and trump run very different campaigns by katie zezima cruz is the disciplined strategist who stays relentlessly on message and runs a by the book organization filled with aides and state chairs trump by contrast runs what amounts to a diy presidential campaign while the approach has left trump with little established infrastructure as the race turns into a brawl for delegates it has also allowed him to be nimble cruz s advance work will be on display this weekend in colorado one of five states that leave it up to party members to elect the state s 37 delegates to the national convention organizers said much of the work has been done with little input from cruz headquarters in houston there are 50 different states with 50 different speeds said ken buck the senator s colorado state chairman trump and cruz face their first test in the virginia delegate fighttomorrow a few hundred republicans are set to gather in wytheville a town of 8 000 in the state s southwest corner to elect three delegates to the republican convention the ap reports at first glance the 9th congressional district s local convention appears to be fertile ground for trump but the cruz campaign is counting on a superior advantage with party insiders both in virginia and around the country to get its preferred delegates elected political watchers say these types of party insiders who take the time to register for and attend regional party meetings are more likely to back cruz the issue is who is going to these convention said terry kilgore a republican state house delegate the cruz people understand the game a little bit better trump leads cruz by 7 points in california according to the field poll the front runner has 39 percent with cruz at 32 percent and kasich at 18 percent trump leads in the bay area and in the southern california region outside of los angeles cruz is preferred over trump in l a properand among voters in thecentral valley and sierra mountains whereas supporters for kasich are somewhat evenly dispersed across the state the primary in june will award delegates by congressional districts former supporters of arnold schwarzenegger prefer trump voters who backed his gubernatorial bid in the recall prefer trump over cruz by a three to one margin trump has more than math to worry about in cleveland by politico s kyle cheney every aspect of the republican national convention is a potential tripwire that motivated anti trump forces could deploy to waylay the mogul five tactics cruz could use to try denying trump the nomination ben carson proved again to be a terrible trump surrogate when asked on cnnif lewandowski should be running the show after being charged with battery he respondedthat alot of people have been charged with various things you ve probably been charged with things the interviewer replied that he has not jeff sessions trump s only supporter in the senate said he does not think trump will pick him as vp i think that

that the clinton sanders rivalry is doing lasting damage to the party and the eventual nominee with both candidates launching 10 day sprints ahead of new york s april 19 primary the strain and resentment of a hard fought and unexpectedly long contest boiled over repeatedly in interviews speeches and other public appearances john wagner abby phillip and annegearanreport the senator from vermont refused to retract his assertion that clinton is not qualified to be president clinton dismissed that claim as silly and countered that sanders has repeatedly made promises he can t keep sanders continued to blame clinton for going on the attack and said he has simply been defending himself and while he expressed regret for the tenor of the campaign over the previous 24 hours and said the acrimony will make it harder for democrats to unite in the fall he also said he does not regret his own statements clinton had raised questions in a television interview about whether sanders was prepared to be president but she repeatedly stopped short of saying he was unqualified president obama who has sought to stay out his party s nominating contest weighed in thursday though a spokesman traveling with obama on air force one white house spokesman eric schultz said obama believes that clinton comes to the race with more experience than any non vice president in recent campaign history schultz emphasized that obama feels fortunate that clinton whom he defeated in a sometimes nasty battle for the 2008 nomination served as his secretary of state in an interview with the post s john wagner sanders stood by his view that clinton is not qualified but he also pledged to support her if she is the nominee three highlights congressional democrats expressed hope thatthe dust up over whether hillary is qualified serves as a warningfor both candidates to tone things down and keep the party more cohesive than the republicans it s really important that everybody take a pause that everybody calm down said north dakota sen heidi heitkamp at this point in campaigns people get tired say things they don t mean to emotions get raw i think a lot of this will dissipate with a couple good nights sleep why is berniethrowing the kitchen sink rightnow because he must fundamentally disruptthe race to have any chance of ultimatelyprevailing sanders still trails clinton by more than 200 pledged delegates the math is close to determinative and not in his favor barring a major cataclysm in the race clinton will be the nominee writes chris cillizza this chart compares clinton s lead over sanders to obama s lead over her at this point in 2008 panama financial scandal blows up into democratic skirmishing over trade by david nakamura scotus nomination battle president obama took pains to describe merrick garland as a unifying figure during a speech at the university of chicago law school juliet eilperin and mike debonis in a carefully orchestrated question and answer session with students and faculty including several of garland s family members the president said failure to confirm his court nominee would make the courts just an extension of our elections and our politics and that erodes the institutional integrity of the judicial branch one questioner pressed obama about the lack of diversity on the bench and asked why he picked a white man obama said that s

legislation or other senate business to gain leverage on the court fight an ultimate step would be to force a floor vote on garland without committee action a move that would almost certainly fail but would attract attention and put those vulnerable republican incumbents on the spot a democratic leadership aide said that is being considered as a last resort one that would not be deployed for months lindsey graham said he will meet with garland reversing course on his earlier pledge not to spokesman kevin bishop said it was a courtesy meeting and the south carolina senator remains opposed to
