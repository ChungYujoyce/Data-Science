patrick s roberts is a political scientist with a focus on public management and the policy process at the nonprofit nonpartisan rand corp he is the author of disasters and the american state how the president responds to a disease outbreak is important but it is only one aspect of multifaceted efforts at every level of government does a county have a system for prioritizing who receives virus tests and for delivering the results quickly will public transit be sanitized answering questions such as these is the real work of disease management and it is not done by the white house for all the speculation about whether coronavirus will doom president trump s reelection voters motivated by the outbreak would do well to focus further down the ballot on the state and local races that will determine who bears the lion s share of responsibility for the response as the coronavirus spreads in communities it will be mayors county judges and school superintendents not federal officials who make the tough calls about whether to declare a state of emergency or shutter public schools and other institutions sometimes those calls will even be at odds with what the white house recommends during the 2014 ebola crisis for example the governor of new jersey r chris christie put a health worker returning from west africa under quarantine christie clashed with president barack obama and centers for disease control and prevention officials who thought the lockdown would be ineffective and discourage other health workers from going to africa to assist with the crisis but it was christie not obama who had the jurisdiction to decide today in maryland it is gov larry hogan r not trump who is working with county officials to track down contacts with the three people in the state who have tested positive for covid 19 hogan was easily reelected in 2018 in part because marylanders appreciated his efficient governance across party lines the coming weeks will tell whether voters
