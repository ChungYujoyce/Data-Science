last updated apr 16 2020 10 17 am edt after dropping out of the 2020 race and backing his former rival vermont senator bernie sanders said he believes the vast majority of his supporters will back joe biden in november although sanders acknowledged that everybody in american knows how different the two are he stressed the choice is pretty clear when deciding between biden and president donald trump sanders spoke to cbs this morning co host tony dokoupil in his first network tv interview since endorsing biden to discuss their ideological differences andwhere he expects biden to adopt a more progressive stance the vermont senator was also asked about other concerns some supporters have including a sexual assault allegation against biden his accuser reportedly filed a police report last week now claiming biden assaulted her in 1993 when she was working in his senate office published reports indicate her story has changed over the years biden s campaign called the allegation untrue and said the alleged incident absolutely did not happen read a portion of their conversation below bernie sanders on day one of my campaign what i said is that if i lose i will be there to support the democratic nominee because it is absolutely imperative that we defeat donald trump who in my view is the most dangerous irresponsible president in the modern history of this country tony dokoupil that s an argument against donald trump but making the argument for joe biden is a different matter sanders to defeat donald trump to me and make sure that he is not reelected is enormously important so if you wanna make the point that joe biden s views are not mine no kidding i think everybody in america knows that dokoupil i made a little list of some of the things that have been central to your campaign and i m hoping you let me know which of these you think could be part of a biden administration universal health care is a biggie free college for all canceled college debt national rent control a ban on fracking a wealth tax marijuana legalization a 50 reduction in the prison population these are all things you ve campaigned on that have made you popular joe biden doesn t support any of them which do you see him moving on sanders well i think you will see him moving on making public colleges and universities tuition free for families earning less than 125 000 not where i was i wanted more i think his views on climate change are not my views but i think he is prepared to invest many hundreds of billions of dollars into sustainable energies like wind and solar and in the process create a whole lot of jobs i think on health care he is not an advocate of medicare for all as i am but i think he s prepared to come forward with some ideas dokoupil has he promised you anything sanders well we have talked about a number of issues and you will see those evolving coming out i believe in the next weeks and months dokoupil joe biden is gonna need every vote that he can get how do you improve on your 2016 record to make sure that sanders my 2016 record was a fine record in this house right here i got a couple of letters from hillary clinton thanking me for the very strong support that i gave her i did rally after rally state after state look the issue is that the american people are gonna have to make a fundamental decision i m gonna play a role in that do we come together to defeat somebody who is a pathological liar somebody who does not believe in the rule of law somebody who is prepared to give massive tax breaks to billionaires and ignore the needs of working families or do we elect joe biden as president i think the choice is pretty clear dokoupil i imagine that you will be fundraising for joe biden sanders well we will decide on what we re gonna do with fundraising all i would say is that we re gonna do everything that we can to make sure that donald trump is not reelected dokoupil how do you campaign in the midst of this pandemic should there be conventions can you have rallies in the late summer maybe sanders well nobody can predict that the last thing that we want do is to do anything which gets more people sick and kills more people that is the last thing that we wanna do so i think that whether or not there ll be a convention remains to be seen i don t know nor does anybody else when rallies will be taking place when candidates will be able to be out on the streets shaking hands and talking to people face to face nobody knows that dokoupil i think it s indisputable that this virus has exposed how medically and financially fragile many sectors of our society are sanders that s right dokoupil in that tragedy and our response to it do you think society may reevaluate the need for the policies you ve been arguing for for 30 years now sanders the answer is yes this pandemic the economic collapse has exposed the fragility of our health care system and our economy in terms of protecting working families that is a lesson that i think many americans are gonna learn from this dokoupil one of your most important allies alexandria ocasio cortez said recently that she thinks it s legitimate and relevant to talk about sexual assault allegations against joe biden do you agree sanders i think it s relevant to talk about anything and i think any woman who feels that she was assaulted has every right in the world to stand up and make her claims dokoupil do you think that should weigh significantly in the mind of sanders i think that she has the right to make her claims and get a public hearing and the public will make their own conclusions about it i just don t know enough about it to comment further dokoupil all right watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream
