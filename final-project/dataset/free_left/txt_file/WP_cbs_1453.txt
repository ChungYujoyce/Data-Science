in this extended transcript of time magazine editor at large jeffrey kluger s interview with elon musk for cbs sunday morning the founder and ceo of spacex discusses the aerospace company s ambitions for flying humans to the moon and mars the importance of reusability in rockets the advantage sof being a privately owned company shooting for the stars and the inspiration of douglas adams jeffrey kluger history is usually most viscerally felt by people who lived it if you lived world war ii you understand world war ii you came along two years after apollo 11 and yet space seems to be in your marrow how did you come to that passion and did apollo 11 particularly play a role in that elon musk apollo 11 landing on the moon was probably the most inspiring thing in history and one of the most universally good things in history people can debate whether this or that is good but i think just the level of inspiration that that provided to the people of earth was incredible and it certainly inspired me and i think everyone at spacex i m not sure spacex would exist if not for apollo 11 kluger seriously musk yes what actually inspired me to create spacex was i kept expecting that we would continue beyond apollo 11 that we would have a base on the moon that we would be sending people to mars and that by 2019 probably would be sending people to the moons of jupiter and i think actually if you ask most people in 1969 they would have expected that and here we are in 2019 the united states actually does not yet have the ability to send people even to low earth orbit this is something that we hope to help solve with the dragon crewed flight in about six months or so but the united states has been without the ability to send people to low earth orbit since i believe 2011 when the shuttle retired so just year after year i kept expecting us to exceed apollo and we didn t and it made me sad about the future and i thought well at least for me and i think probably for a lot of people you wanna have a sense that the future s gonna be better than the past and if you don t have that sense it leads to cynicism pessimism and just not being excited about life about the future when you get up in the morning what fires you up like what gets you excited about being alive there s just not that many things but for sure you wanna believe that we re gonna be out there as a space bearing civilization out there among the stars and that s the thing that i get really excited about that kind of future i think most people do i mean anyone who has an adventurous spirit i think does and so this applies to those who have an adventurous spirit anywhere in the world and i think arguably particularly in united states which is a nation of explorers and is in my view a distillation of the human spirit of exploration kluger certainly lots of other people who love space felt that same despair felt that same disappointment i certainly did and yet i didn t build a space company and you did so what was it that made you think yeah this has to be done and i m the guy who can do it or at least one of the guys who can do it musk well i didn t think i was one of the guys who could do it i thought starting spacex would be 90 likely to fail and the way i actually started out was i was gonna do a philanthropic mission called mars oasis to land a small greenhouse on the surface of mars with seeds in dehydrated nutrient gel that would hydrate upon landing and you ve have this incredible shot of green plants against a red background and it thought that this would hopefully inspire the public that we need to advance space beyond what it is what has been before and that we need to send people to mars and just expand our horizons you know do more actually my goal was simply to get the public excited which would get then congress excited so that they would then appropriate more money and increase nasa s budget so my goal was actually i was gonna take half the money that i made from paypal and essentially it would be gone in order to increase nasa s budget and then we d go to mars and then i went to russia a couple of times because i couldn t afford the american rockets they were too expensive and russia was decommissioning a whole bunch of icbms so in 2001 and early 2002 i went to russia to try to buy some decommissioned icbms which sounds crazy laughs but you know they re gonna throw them away anyway so then buying a scrap rocket that s the only kind of rocket that i could afford seemed like the way to go but they kept raising the price on me and i also came to realize that even if we demonstrated this mission that the cost of access to space was just too high and that even if we doubled nasa s budget unless nasa had good options for rocket contractors they would still not make progress cause it would just be more expendable rockets and we d be at risk of a flags and footprints outcome for mars which is still better than not going there at all but not as good as having a base on mars a base on the moon and ultimately a self sustaining city on mars and so i was like okay i gotta try building a rocket company here i thought this was like almost certain to fail in fact i would not let anyone invest in the company in the beginning cause it was like i can t take people s money this is gonna fail so i actually just funded the whole company in the beginning myself not because i thought it would turn out well but because i thought it would fail kluger now one of the sweetest spots in all the world for people who love space is pad 39a musk it s the best pad kluger most historic how could you not love it musk absolutely laughs right kluger apollo 11 left from there virtually all of the lunar landing and orbital missions left from there musk i can t believe we get to use this pad an insane honor kluger and that s my question what does that feel like that is spacex s leased pad now musk well we re not worthy laughs this pad is too good kluger i mean do you ever wake up in the morning and think i got pad 39a musk i mean it s mad laughs what the hell it s really great that nasa s letting us use this pad yeah kluger do you talk to many of the people who are there the controllers the astronauts nasa flight director gene kranz buzz aldrin neil armstrong mike collins jim lovell have you connected with these folks musk yeah i ve talked to most of them over the years not all but most and probably had most interaction with buzz i think he s quite a big supporter of what we re doing and he s got a good technical understanding and so he is also quite pro mars i believe yeah kluger i m glad you said that cause that brings something else up for me you speak a great deal about the need for humanity to become a multi world species not just because it appeals to human ego but because it s an existential question the sun s gonna burn out at some point even if we don t in some way annihilate ourselves so we need other places to live my two questions are how do the moon and mars figure into this idea and second of all how in the world do you focus enthusiastic followers who sometimes can t focus on the next fiscal quarter for a disaster that s gonna happen three billion years from now musk well thank goodness spacex is not public huh if laughs there was a disaster oh my god the nice thing about spacex is we never we think about is a launch in a quarter or out of a quarter we always just what s the right move here it never even enters our minds what s this quarter gonna look like you know whereas a publicly traded company you just get beaten with a stick if things move slightly from one week to the next and one quarter to the next it s insane as warren buffet said being a publicly traded company is like having someone stand at the edge of your property of your house and yell prices at you all day long laughs and you re like what is this person doing they re like manic depressive laughs they don t bring their meds or they re like giving you really negative or they could be overly exuberant and every single day they just keep yelling prices at you so it s just nutty we certainly don t have the whole sort of short seller phenomenon which in my view shorting should be illegal it s a crazy anachronism so we can just focus on advancing the technology getting our launches right and we can be heads down without distraction that s very helpful at spacex and then we re just like how do we advance the fundamentals of a space technology i mean the holy grail of access to space is a fully reusable orbital rocket and we ve made significant progress towards reusability with reuse of the falcon 9 boost aid and that s somewhere around two thirds of the cost of launch maybe 70 of the cost of launch is just the boost aid stage and we ve just recently been successful in catching the nose cone of the rocket we that is a crazy exercise with boat that s basically a giant catcher s mitt laughs the actual complexity of recovering the fairing the nose cone apparatus which holds rocket payloads being jettisoned into orbit is so nuts like i m not sure we should ve done it we have done it but each fairing half is like a tiny spacecraft with little thrusters on it so when it s coming in from space it s in vacuum and little thrusters controlling the fairing cause it s gotta come down round side down cause that s where it s got a heat shield it s got a thermal protection or heat shield on the outer surface but not on the inner surface so it s gotta come down with the rounded surface coming down and it s gotta maintain its attitude as it comes in through space and it comes in hot if you look at the fairing entry video you see super heated plasma and sparks and stuff flying off of it it s coming in at basically five times faster than a bullet from an assault rifle it s insane and then it hits the atmosphere it goes subsonic we deploy the parachutes and the parachute itself is a steerable parachute with actuators so it s steering itself down and coming down on glide path and then the boat closes a data link with each fairing half and the boat adjusts course automatically and then the two just maneuver to touch each other and we only just solved that in the last launch kluger it s like an aerial puppet show with marionettes coming down and the stage moving to catch it musk it s insane kluger all of this of course is with an eye towards again this multi planet species idea so mars is a rather sterile planet right now musk a fixer upper laugh mars is a fixer upper of a planet kluger it s a fixer upper and it does have some potential for fertility the moon well not so much on the other hand the moon is in the backyard so you can practice there so do you see these two worlds as being some sort of tandem would what our unmanned probes un crewed probes are getting us now on mars and what you re doing how do you see all this working together as our first big step toward this idea of multi planet species musk in order for us to be a multi planet species we must solve full reusability of rockets in the absence of that i think the only possibility are flags and footprints cause it would just be far too expensive it would be as though if in the old days ships were not reusable the cost of an ocean voyage would be tremendous and you d need to have a second ship towed behind you just for the return journey so you can imagine if air flights was not reusable if airplanes were not reusable nobody would fly cause each airliner costs a couple hundred million dollars and people do not wanna pay that for a single journey so this is why full and rapid reusability is the holy grail of access to space and is a fundamental step towards it without which we cannot become a multi planet species we cannot have a base on the moon we cannot have a city on mars without full and rapid reusability this is why we ve been working so hard towards reusability at spacex and put a tremendous amount of engineering into achieving reusability of the boost stage and now of the fairing and the one piece that s missing is the upper stage of falcon 9 that is not currently reusable and we have no plans to make it reusable kluger interesting how come musk because starship is gonna be a solution we could technically make the upper stage of falcon 9 reusable but it s just not the right architecture for reusability starship is the right architecture you essentially need a more efficient engine than merlin you need a more efficient propellant mix combination liquid methane and liquid oxygen is just more efficient than rocket propellant grade kerosene which is basically a highly refined jet fuel and so there are all these fundamental architectural things that need to change if we tried full reusability including the upper stage with falcon 9 we wouldn t quite achieve full and rapid reusability which is that s really like an aircraft like when an aircraft lands you only expect to refuel it maybe replace water and food kluger clean out the seatbacks musk clean it out yeah exactly it minor you aren t expecting to change the engines or repaint the aircraft or anything like that it s just refuel food and water and clean it out and maybe there s a few things that occasionally break but the normal expectation is that you can re fly the plane very rapidly you can turn around in an hour and fly somewhere else this is what needs to happen with rockets kluger if the elon musk of 2019 could talk to wernher von braun and chris kraft and all of the heroes of the 1960s and apart from reusability if you had one piece of advice to give them whether it was technological spiritual salesmanship long term vision what would you tell these guys musk well wernher von braun really knew what he was doing i mean his plans were for reusability but those plans were stymied i mean it s so insane the way rockets work today with the exception of falcon 9 it would be like if you got a plane and the way you get to your destination is you bail out with a parachute laughs over the city in question and your plane crash lands somewhere okay that s how rockets work today with the exception of falcon 9 this is completely bonkers it is so hard to make a rocket it s about as hard to make a rocket as it is to make an advance airplane maybe rockets are a little harder in some ways but not that much harder it s just that we live in a deep gravity well and so the technical difficulty of a fully reusable rocket is higher than the technical difficulty of a fully reusable plane if earth s gravity was just 10 lower fully reusable rockets would be easy and if it was 10 higher i think it might arguably be impossible it s very finely balanced so for example on mars which has about 37 of earth s gravity you can go single stage basically a single ship from the surface of mars all the way to the surface of earth no booster required but on earth you need a giant booster even though it s basically four tenths of the gravity it s night and day kluger your largest goal is not to put too fine a point on it but to help save humanity and i know you don t put it that way but musk it s not like there s a desire for appreciation or gratitude or anything like that you don t wanna be sort of morally onerous in this situation but really i think it s just in order to have an exciting future we must be a space bearing civilization the defense of reasons i think are important you know because being a multi planet species the light of consciousness will be preserved it s far more likely or at least for a longer period of time that the light of consciousness which would continue to shine and if we re a single planet species well we re just sitting around waiting for either the self annihilation or some external event and that ll be it kluger but there s some people who would argue that our existential crisis at the moment is a climate crisis musk sure and i m trying to help on that too kluger right i know you are and that s actually what i was thinking about because obviously your solar city your solar panel cars musk yeah solar tesla electric cars kluger and all that s very important but there are people who argue that the same monomaniacal and i mean that in a good way in the best meaning of the term focus the ferocious commitment and the extraordinary creativity that spacex brings to the work it does if that same kind of energy caliber and quality of energy were brought toward developing a truly renewable truly clean power grid the knock off effects in terms of the saving of the species would be more immediate and eas well no it wouldn t be easy but it would be easier to see what the endgame is in relatively short term do you ever think about that in those 3 a m hours maybe i could just save the planet s environment instead musk well i think tesla s actually made great progress towards a sustainable energy economy in terms of from solar to storage to electric vehicles i think for electrification of transport tesla s arguably advanced the cores of sustainable transport by ten years maybe 20 probably at least ten the fundamental good of tesla i would say should be measured by to what degree has it accelerated the advent of sustainable energy and i think it s about a decade maybe it s two decades these are small numbers in the grand scheme of things but they do matter from a total sort of co2 capacity of the oceans and atmosphere and i wish there was some way to do rockets by the way without burning things but there isn t i mean newton s third law no way around it so balancing what is the best for humanity well there s just no other way to do it except rockets whereas there is another way to do terrestrial transport including aircraft and everything else everything except rockets i wanna clean it can be done with batteries and will be done with batteries it s important like to note that i think the world would move towards sustainable energy without tesla as a catalyst it would just get there it would just take longer and so what s the marginal value of effort like how much more could tesla make it happen if let s say if i consider my own time if i were to fully allocate myself to tesla how much faster could we grow versus if i don t full allocate and sort of just put my time between spacex and tesla i think the marginal value is relatively limited i think i could maybe make it happen a couple years faster and then you feel like you could say like the keeling curve of co2 parts per million in the atmosphere like how much of a dent would that make i d rather have a tesla take a couple years longer and still have spacex cause i think this is the right balance for the greater good kluger 1960s we had a very bipolar very binary competition u s soviet it was very bracing we don t have that now but we do have a somewhat distributed one there s the u s there s maybe china there s blue origin there s virgin there s spacex is it too unfocused or do you think this is helping to energize our return to the moon musk well i don t see a lot of progress on reusable orbital vehicles to be totally frank there s certainly talk of such things but the only even partially reusable orbital vehicle right now is the falcon 9 and i hope there are others getting to orbit from an aircraft is actually counterproductive i would say it sort of seems like it would be helpful but it s really not that helpful the aircraft maybe helps 2 and then all the negatives of an aircraft are minus 20 it s like a 10x difference for sub orbital flight aircraft is fine but not for orbit you know like von braun really knew what he was doing like i said he was not in favor of like trying to carry the saturn 5 under some gargantuan aircraft kluger yeah would ve been a bad idea musk a bad idea but i think it s good what for example jeff bezos is doing with blue origin you know occasionally i ll like you know rib him a little bit but you know i think it s good what he s doing kluger do you rib him do you ever talk back and forth the two of you musk yeah yeah occasionally make some fun kluger can i sit in the room for one of those calls laughs one day musk i mean i think he s done a great thing with amazon and obviously nobody s perfect but you know i think it s good that he s allocating a lot of resources to blue origin kluger right right yeah they re doing some good work very good work as you guys are musk 16 43 30 the right general goal musk we re basically taking everything we ve learned from falcon 9 and putting it into starship starship is super next level kluger it seems to be and that a question that i would like to ask you musk yeah starship s mind blowing i mean there s not even anything that s ever been proposed on on the caliber of starship that i m aware of kluger you don t have to be a space geek like i am to know that you folks are building some beautiful machines the original falcon was sleek and lean and beautiful the 9 is terrific the heavy it s the biggest machine flying today musk yes kluger you could get to the moon with maybe two heavies it would take or maybe just one heavy musk yeah well i think you probably would wanna do it with two but you could absolutely do it with three kluger and in that case i guess my question is instead of going with what you ve got and saying let s get ourselves to the moon in three years you re going an even more ambitious step further with super heavy the bfr and starship musk well i think we could sort of repeat apollo 11 and do a few small missions send people back to the moon but it would be somewhat of a repeat of apollo and it s like the remake s never as good as the original laughs so i think like we really wanna have a vehicle that is capable of sending enough payload to the moon or mars such that we could have a full lunar base a permanently occupied lunar base would be i know incredible you know we ve got a permanently occupied base in antarctica and it d be absolutely way cooler to have a science base on the moon kluger i would agree on that yeah musk yeah it d be super great and so if you re having a base on the moon now you need a lotta cargo if you look at say the lunar lander it was pretty small kluger it was tiny kluger and it was made out aluminum foil origami basically musk yes exactly it was incredible engineering but just very tiny so we need something big to have a self sustaining city on mars you gotta decide okay how you gonna get a million tons to mars so that s why we re trying to build it as fast as possible you know i think it s generally a good idea for a company that is building technology to try to make its own products redundant as quickly as possible kluger that s a nice idea musk yeah it s like slightly discomforting cause we ve put so much work into falcon 9 and falcon heavy and dragon but actually the thing we should aspire to do is to render them redundant as quickly as possible and we ll put them in the museum kluger when will we start seeing regular runs to the international space station on a crewed dragon i know that the idea is when you re ready to fly safely but do you have a target date you re shooting for now musk to launch a crew to the space station well this is for sure both a nasa and a spacex readiness thing so from a spacex readiness standpoint my guess is we re about six months away kluger lovely musk and it might be weirdly whatever the schedule currently looks like it s a bit like zeno s paradox you sort of halfway there at any given point in time and then somehow you get there so if our schedule currently says about four months which it currently says about four months then probably about eight months is correct kluger that s a good way of inverse math but that s how these things work musk it often works that way you can t assume eight months otherwise it will be 16 months it s bizarre kluger larger goals if you had to bet your house on when the next boot prints would be on the moon and when those would be spacex so those may be two different questions this is just spit balling what kind of timeframe do you see musk well this is gonna sound pretty crazy but i think we could land on the moon in less than two years certainly with an un crewed vehicle i believe we could land on the moon in two years so then maybe within a year or two of that we could be sending crew i would say four years at the outside kluger and when you say we do you mean the united states or you mean spacex musk well i m not sure i mean if we ve got two choices which if it were to take longer to convince nasa and the authorities that we can do it versus just doing it then we might just do it i think we wanna aim to do it and then enable our capability but it may literally be easier to just land starship on the moon than try to convince nasa that we can it might actually be easier to just do it i don t know cause obviously this is like a decision authority that s out of my hands but the sheer amount of effort required to convince a large number of skeptical engineers at nasa that we can do it is very high and not unreasonably so cause they re like uh come on how could could this possibly work but the skepticism they d have good reasons for it but the for sure way to end the skepticism is just do it kluger just do it yeah musk hey look here s a picture of landing there right now laughs that might be the better way to do it we ll see but i think sending crews to mars in four years i think that sounds pretty doable like internally we would aim for two years and then reality might be four kluger lastly there are gonna be feet on the moon there are gonna be feet on mars could they be yours one day musk i would like to go to the moon and mars i think that d be quite fun but i need to make sure like the overarching goal here is help make life multi planetary this is not some sort of personal quest to go to the moon or go to mars my sort of philosophical foundation is in line with douglas adams the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy everyone has their sort of favorite philosopher but my favorite philosopher is douglas adams kluger that s a good one to have musk well he s dead now but he s got a laughs great attitude and he s fun guy and a good sense of humor and what he was essentially saying is the universe is the answer what are the questions kluger lovely musk and if we expand the scope and scale of consciousness then we are better able to understand what questions to ask we ll learn more we ll become more enlightened and so we should try to do the things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness and becoming a multi planet species and ensuring that we have a sustainable climate on earth these are very important to that overarching philosophy so that s the philosophy i buy into kluger it s a good one and it holds a lotta potential for the future of the species musk right for
