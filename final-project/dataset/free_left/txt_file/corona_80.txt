leading experts on this family of viruses structural biologist rolf hilgenfeld stood out the total number of people infected if you combine sars mers previous related coronavirus outbreaks and this new virus is under 12 500 people that s not a market the number of cases is too small pharmaceutical companies are not interested he told the scientific journal hilgenfeld was on his way to hubei province even as the chinese government was placing the 57 million population of wuhan and surrounding cities under lockdown or f ng ch ng to test early stage drug candidates on animals infected by the new coronavirus designated 2019 ncov he had been asked how quickly it would take to complete preclinical testing and ultimately assuming positive results how soon such a response to the disease might be ready for deployment but his answer suggested that this sort of misses the point because by the time an effective drug might be ready it would be too late not just this time but whenever these sorts of events happen the problem is that once a compound is ready to go by that point an outbreak may be over why would any company make such a huge investment in drug discovery only to find at the end that there were no patients there is the possibility of performing research on coronaviruses in general and developing antiviral coronavirus therapies for many coronaviruses which are also responsible along with many other viruses for the illness we collectively call the common cold instead of just this particular one well ahead of such an outbreak so as to have a decent head start when a novel coronavirus event does occur indeed this sort of preparative work is precisely what he and his colleague university of hong kong microbiologist malik peiris argued was necessary in a 2013 review paper on lessons learned from ten years of research into highly pathogenic coronaviruses in particular from the sars and mers outbreaks in that paper he cheered the huge progress that had occurred into the function and structures of the sars coronavirus including some research into vaccine development and evaluation on animal models but after the outbreak waned by 2005 there was no incentive to further develop sars cov vaccines no money either for development of antivirals for people who have already been infected by the virus that is there is no money to be made but it s not just the private sector he took funding agencies to task as well he did not explain why but we might it is not surprising that a neoliberalized public sector in which tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy are prioritized over human need will also find that the cupboard is bare when it comes to diseases that only kill a few tens of thousands and perhaps fair enough for a given size of pie there are only so many decent sized slices to go around hilgenfeld conceded that virologists themselves likely failed to take the threat of the reemergence of a sars like virus sufficiently seriously but then the mers coronavirus hit in 2013 killing some 850 people researchers and public health officials were now increasingly cognizant of the potential threat from this family of illnesses in 2016 alimuddin zumla a professor of infectious diseases and international health at university college london argued in a paper that the continuing threat of coronaviruses in the wake of the mers outbreak presented a golden opportunity to overcome the obstacles to the development of anti coronavirus drugs he called for the creation of an international collaborative network combining clinicians virologists and drug developers backed with political commitment to carry out clinical trials on anti coronavirus drugs that have already been shown to be safe and effective in vitro popularly described as test tube experiments and in animal models zumla echoed hilgenfeld s concerns that the waxing and waning of numbers of new patients made recruitment for clinical trials difficult and reduced the incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop antiviral drugs adding that mers cases being predominantly confined to the middle east didn t help there is also a lack of industrial incentives to develop antivirals for mild infections for other less pathogenic coronaviruses the ones that cause the common cold to be sure there are other significant challenges specific to coronaviruses that make drug development difficult above all they are one of the most diverse and rapidly mutating groups of viruses and new strains emerge unpredictably this means that drugs that target existing coronaviruses may not be effective against new ones for sars and mers experiments using animal models such as transgenic mice and non human primates can only be performed in a few biosafety level 3 high containment laboratories and they are technically exacting to boot but zumla also wrote that it was the lack of industrial incentives that was the most important obstacle writing in a 2009 book on disaster medicine the associate director of the national infectious diseases service at the veterans health administration shantini gamage and her colleagues also noted the unique challenge of coronaviruses given that information is learned about the pathogen and the disease as the epidemic progresses and even if despite this research is successful it is still the case that it generally takes about eight years in the united states to march through clinical trials approval and marketing but once again gamage hit upon the unavoidable challenge that the market just doesn t work here referring to coronaviruses such as sars and mers she argued that we cannot win this fight unless the public sector leads the charge factoring in the high cost of drug development the relatively low numbers of cases of an emerging infectious disease initially and the chance that the epidemic will end with no further cases pharmaceutical companies would be unlikely to even initiate the discovery process without government intervention or incentives the great news is that hilgenfeld thinks he and his colleagues might have figured out a way around this amoral indifference of market actors they have developed compounds that are not just active against coronaviruses but also a large family of enteroviruses some 500 000 children catch one known as enterovirus 71 annually causing hand foot and mouth disease and if something wins approval for these diseases the researchers reckon that they can also quickly deploy that same drug when we are hit by the next coronavirus outbreak half a million cases now that s market attractive we can get pharma involved he told the journal let s hope he s right three cheers to hilgenfeld for figuring out a way that may make coronavirus therapeutic development coincide with the profit imperatives of the large pharmaceutical companies but why should researchers have to bend themselves into knots attempting to make their work coincide with the imperatives of profit making especially if such work is in the realm of public health and what do we do when for a particular area within public health research development and deployment rd d there just isn t any way to shoehorn in profit making the really great news at least for this particular coronavirus is that it appears to be only moderately infectious and it has a fatality rate much lower than sars or mers but at some point in the future there will be one that is more virulent and infectious alongside this public health officials and researchers are cheering what they describe as unprecedented cooperation freely sharing sequence data setting aside egos and the use of social media for once playing a positive role to facilitate communication between researchers in real time scientists are working around the clock journals have opened some access to relevant papers researchers cum pirates have used the illegal open access website sci hub to make more than 5 000 scientific articles relating to coronaviruses fully searchable and free the initiators of this effort declared dividing the world s scientists with a paywall in the middle of a global humanitarian crisis is an unacceptable and unforgivable act of criminal greed as paleontologist and author of the r evolution in open science jon tennant put it open science saves lives all this extra market cooperation or solidarity the term we on the left use to describe such selfless deep humanism offers a hint of the better world to come where no one does anything for profit any longer but simply works in service of one another and of the collective advance of freedom in other good news where the chinese government was widely condemned internationally for its tardiness and secrecy during the sars outbreak beijing appears to have since learned its lessons the country has been commended by the who for the speed transparency and competence with which it is tackling the outbreak although fresh reportage from the new york times suggests that officials could be doing even more in addition in the wake of the sars outbreak and following on from the challenges faced in dealing with ebola in west africa a raft of new global partnerships including the international severe acute respiratory and emerging infection consortium isaric the emerging diseases clinical assessment and response network edcarn the global research collaboration for infectious disease preparedness glopid r and the who r d blueprint have been established they straddle the public private divide explicitly recognizing that the market left to its own devices is insufficient in dealing with these new threats the establishment of such partnerships networks and mechanisms has long been one of the primary recommendations of public health officials this is undoubtedly a massive step forward another of these networks the nonprofit public private coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi was launched in 2017 to develop epidemic preventing vaccines and antivirals independent of this market failure last week it announced some 12 5 million in funding for a university of queensland lab the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and two small us biotech firms moderna inc and inovio pharmaceuticals to look at three different pathways to develop vaccines for 2019 ncov they aim to have a vaccine ready for human testing in sixteen weeks down from the years that such efforts normally take but even if the cepi coordinated strategy confronts no unexpected difficulties the next step mass production of a vaccine would present a fresh challenge that cepi does not have the resources to tackle according to the journal science inovio s facilities could produce 100 000 doses a year the queensland researchers four times that and moderna 100 million doses that sounds like a lot but as the author of the piece reports in a worst case scenario this would be far from sufficient for the world s population moderna and inovio stocks may have gone through the roof upon the announcement but as mark feinberg the head of the international aids vaccine initiative and former chief scientific officer with american pharmaceutical giant merck s vaccine division during the last ebola outbreak warned medical news outlet stat the prospects and the amount of work involved will necessarily take a small biotech company away from their core business and the interest of their investors in getting a return on their investment and it is not just coronaviruses or other emerging infectious diseases that confront this problem as covered elsewhere in these pages the crisis of bacterial antibiotic resistance that humanity faces which has the potential to undermine much of modern medicine because so much of it from surgeries to catheters and injections to even many diagnostic procedures depends upon a background of antimicrobial protection is primarily a problem of insufficient profitability if successful a course of antibiotics is only taken for a few weeks or months at most and then the patient is cured and stops purchasing those drugs but with chronic diseases the patient has to purchase those drugs on a regular basis for the rest of their lives and so most of the large pharmaceutical companies largely got out of the business of antibiotic research and production more than three decades ago antifungal therapeutics face an identical profitability challenge an extensive 2019 feature in the new york times by science journalists matt richtel and andrew jacobs investigated the spread over the last five years around the world of the fungus candida auris which is resistant to some or all antifungal medications half of all those infected die within ninety days as a result this fungus has forced even a renowned british medical center to shut down its intensive care unit and the paper on the scale of the problem that the reporters depended on for the backbone of their story unsurprisingly lays the blame for the sparse discovery pipeline on a chronic lack of investment in novel antifungal agents because most pharmaceutical companies are not investing in antifungals preferring to focus on other apparently more lucrative areas in 2018 the financial giant goldman sachs issued a report that asked is curing patients a sustainable business model the analyst thought that gilead science s treatment for hepatitis c which produced cure rates in excess of 90 percent offered a cautionary tale while us sales hit as much as 12 5 billion in 2015 they slid to a mere 4 billion three years later because its hepatitis c franchise has gradually exhausted the available pool of treatable patients infectious diseases in particular pose a challenge to profitability because curing existing patients also decreases the number of carriers able to transmit the virus to new patients cancer thank god the report concluded does not pose this problem the unsaid corollary of course being we damn well better not find a cure for cancer as odious as all this appears the problem therefore is not immorality or evil as we often hear but amorality the market can only ever provide what is profitable it is utterly indifferent to human needs so in the end these rd d networks that are heroically responding to what they acknowledge is a market failure are in the end just very advanced forms of charity a sort of well intentioned warmhearted corporate subsidy that addresses the symptoms but not the systemic cause of the problem it is akin to offering drugs to ease a patient s emphysema without telling him to quit smoking instead or rather in addition to this for these research networks are essential not just for the funds they disburse pharmaceutical rd d should be entirely freed from the limitations imposed on it by market amorality the sector should be taken into the public realm and employ the postal model where profitable routes cross subsidize money losing routes but in this case unprofitable drug discovery and manufacture would be paid for by their profitable counterparts this is not the predictable ramblings of a democratic socialist it is rather the recommendation last year of the uk s superbug tsar jim o neill a former chief economist for goldman sachs he suggested that nationalizing drug companies would be the best solution to the antibiotic resistance crisis comparing the current situation to the 2008 financial crash that forced the nationalization of the royal bank of scotland and as with that emergency nationalization within the financial sector over a decade ago today we also don t have a lot of time to wait in the pharmaceutical sector we already confront a crisis of antimicrobial resistance and the threat from 2019 ncov could turn out to be moderate but this may not always be the case with coronaviruses or other emerging infectious diseases the executive director of the who emergencies programme michael ryan said last summer we are entering a very new phase of high impact epidemics at the time he spoke the who was tracking some 160 disease events around the world nine of them at the organization s highest emergency level i don t think we ve ever had a situation where we re responding to so many emergencies at one time this is a new normal i don t expect the frequency of these events to reduce the situation is a product of the confluence of increased travel and trade through the advent of globalization rapid urbanization rising wealth in economies such as china and india as well as climate change deforestation and the consolidation of food animal production in addition to tackling these ecological challenges that contribute to the risk from infectious disease we need a pharmaceutical sector fit for the twenty first century quite simply the free market is holding back the advance of science medicine and public health leigh phillips is a
