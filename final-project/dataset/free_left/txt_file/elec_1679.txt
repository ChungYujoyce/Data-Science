advertisement supported by news analysis by jonathan martin washington when donald j trump descended on the capital friday he was expected to finally concede that the racially tinged falsehood he had gleefully propagated that president obama was born outside of the united states had in fact been a lie but before mr trump got around to what was a grudging and terse admission which itself included a falsehood about the provenance of so called birtherism he had some business to tend to nice hotel said mr trump the republican nominee for president delighting in his newest property and the opportunity to plug it free on live television he was holding his news conference at his new hotel in the old post office building on pennsylvania avenue which he promised is going to be something very special he seemed untroubled in using an ostensible campaign event just a few blocks from the white house to openly promote his personal commercial interests 52 days before the election in fact this past week offered a vivid illustration of how little regard mr trump has for the long held expectations of america s leaders he is not only breaking the country s political norms he and his campaign aides are now all but mocking them besides using his campaign as a platform to make money on a new hotel mr trump leveled an untrue assertion that hillary clinton had been the first to claim mr obama was born abroad he also boasted about his health on the show of a daytime television celebrity while releasing just his testosterone levels and a few other details about his well being mr trump also continued to flout 40 years of tradition by refusing to release his tax returns a decision that his eldest son admitted this week was not based on an audit as mr trump has repeatedly claimed but on a desire not to distract from the campaign s main message beyond his handling of personal information he also casually accused the chairwoman of the federal reserve of corruption claimed that the bipartisan national debate commission was rigged against him and stated that mrs clinton had not proposed a child care plan she has and did so a year before he did he also mocked an african american pastor who had just welcomed him to her church and again referred to senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts who once said she had native american roots as pocahontas people are motivated to vote by a combination of individual priorities group culture candidate outreach and how easy or hard it is to cast a ballot and that was all before friday night when mr trump hinted at violence against mrs clinton by inviting her secret service detail to disarm and see what happens to her routine falsehoods unfounded claims and inflammatory language have long been staples of mr trump s anything goes campaign but as the polls tighten and november nears his behavior and the implications for the country should he become president are alarming veteran political observers and leaving them deeply worried about the precedent being set regardless of who wins the white house it s frightening said vin weber a former republican congressman from minnesota our politics because of him is descending to the level of a third world country there s just nothing beneath him and i don t know why we would think he would change if he became president that s what s really scary stephen hess who served in the eisenhower and nixon administrations could not even contemplate the prospect of mr trump as commander in chief it s incredibly depressing mr hess said of mr trump he s the most profoundly ignorant man i ve ever seen at this level in terms of understanding the american presidency and even more troubling he makes no effort to learn anything mr trump s advocates insist that the critics are missing the larger impact of his candidacy and how his campaign and presidency could be a force for good as a new york times cbs poll released last week indicated voters see him as more likely to aggressively confront what they see as a rotten political system even if they recognize mr trump as a risky choice on the things that are really big he will in some clumsy way force real change said newt gingrich the former house speaker who is an adviser to mr trump washington won t be the same when he s done but that is what is so worrisome to many observers of mr trump s rise his critics fear that his norm breaking campaign portends a political future in which candidates pay no penalty for unabashedly telling untruths disregarding the public s right to know and lobbing racially charged accusations i worry that if those of us in politics and the media don t do a lot of soul searching after this election a slightly smarter trump will succeed in the future said jon favreau mr obama s former chief speechwriter for some politicians and consultants the takeaway from this election will be that they can get away with almost anything as martin nolan a former editor and reporter at the boston globe who has chronicled politics for over 50 years put it truth has a low priority in the misnomer known as reality tv 15 photos view slide show rules mr nolan added are for losers the only salvation this year argue mr trump s detractors is that he is a singular figure in american life and his would be successors will not be able to skirt accountability in the fashion of the celebrity provocateur he has inflicted stockholm syndrome on america said stacey abrams a democrat and the minority leader of the georgia house it s not even that we re numb to it it s just that we ve always enjoyed the show it s entertaining to hate him to like him and to imagine being him but while there may not be another mr trump he does seem to have thrust the country into a new era with american culture increasingly coarse and ever more obsessed with celebrity the country s politics were bound to eventually catch up less than 25 years after bill clinton shocked some by unabashedly answering a question about his underwear preference on television mr trump purposefully brought up the size of his penis at a televised debate it is not difficult to find republicans who recoil at how their own nominee has to borrow the phrase made famous by daniel patrick moynihan the former new york senator and sociologist defined deviancy down trump is reflecting a culture that is more crass more accepting of vulgarity and more attuned to pop culture said matt lewis a conservative writer the bar has been lowered where going on dr oz is perfectly acceptable and maybe even cutting edge where republicans differ is over whether the acceptance of mrs clinton s transgressions is just as ominous for the country you can t have a republic without virtue and i don t think there s great virtue in either of them said tom coburn the former oklahoma senator of mr trump and mrs clinton still mr weber who arrived in washington as a congressional staff member shortly after the post watergate election of 1974 said mr trump s approach would inflict the most damage on his own party you don t want to say this is the equivalent of watergate mr weber said but at least that was a discrete crime in a way trump is harder to deal with and republicans didn t feel compelled to defend watergate they drove richard nixon out of office advertisement
