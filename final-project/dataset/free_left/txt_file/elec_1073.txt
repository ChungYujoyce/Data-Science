 charlotte n c the closely watched special u s house election being held here tuesday is taking place in the shadow of a political scandal that according to the candidates is having a real impact on the race but this time around the issue is not the illegal ballot harvesting that marred last year s contest it s the fact the one of the candidates has been effectively running for over two years democratic candidate dan mccready likes to tell his supporters that he began running for the 9th congressional district seat when his wife laura was pregnant with their fourth child their daughter recently celebrated her second birthday the republican candidate state sen dan bishop agrees saying that mccready s marathon campaign is why the race is by all accounts neck and neck in a district that president donald trump won by 12 points in 2016 the media sorta relentlessly asks me well why is this race close and i have to remind them dan mccready has been running for 28 months bishop told a small gathering of supporters recently at a refurbished barn in union county outside of charlotte mccready s nearly two and a half year campaign and bishop s late entrance into the race is the result of a mail in absentee ballot scheme that led the north carolina state board of elections to throw out the results of the 2018 election after an investigation and a four day trial the board called for a new election then republican candidate mark harris dropped his candidacy after admitting to misstatements during the emotional hearing that led to a new primary election which bishop a conservative state senator won nearly four months ago the scandal of 2018 which occurred in the more rural parts of the district with fewer voters is not in the forefront of this election but the district s history of absentee ballot fraud isn t ignored either mccready mentioned it at a get out the vote rally for supporters at the beer bar brawley s beverage on this final weekend of the campaign a subtle reminder that the fraud happened at the behest of republicans this election on september 10 is the people s chance to get justice and have their vote heard mccready told nbc news

absentee mail in ballots and who submits them they board also provides extensive detail on absentee ballots online and they have a team of investigators to follow up on complaints if there s an anomaly in the absentee ballot data it will be found said pat gannon spokesperson for the state board of elections michael bitzer professor of southern politics at catawba college in salisbury n c who tracks voter data in north carolina elections says that of all the early votes cast fewer than three percent have been cast via mail which he said is on par with the expected state average i haven t seen any kind of mysterious trends appear like exorbitant absnetee by mail absentee ballot requests bitzer said i just think 2018 brought such a spot light that everybody is on their best behavior still the 2018 election is on the back of minds of voters mccready supporter mary lou cagle said that mccready should have declared the winner instead of calling for a new election that is likely to have lower voter turnout i wish what they would have done is let dan win she said i mean just throw those ballots out and let dan win bishop who had nothing to do with the absentee ballot scandal said he doesn t think the republican party is tainted because of it but he did acknowledge that some frustration among voters about holding a new election i do think that people were very discouraged that 285 000 votes were cast aside on an issue that involved very very few bishop told nbc news referring to the amount of votes cast in the 2018 election in a tainted vote count mccready was behind republican mark harris in the 2018 race by fewer than 900 votes when democrats swept congressional districts across the country now that democrats control the house of representatives political

all about pointing to the green new deal and some democrats position to de criminalize crossing the border he is tying mccready to house speaker nancy pelosi rep alexandria ocasio cortez and sen

successfully deployed by scores of democrats who won in 2018 bishop s campaign is also working to put a dent into mccready who has high name recognition after nearly 28 months on the campaign trail mccready has built his image running biographical positive television ads bishop has resorted to a mostly negative campaign in an attempt to shift public opinion of mccready bishop told supporters that his campaign is working we are surging we ve caught him and we re going to beat him bishop said to applause bishop is also hanging on the president s popularity in the district insisting that trump s support here remains strong trump has been campaigning from afar for bishop with tweets and emails to supporters he ll hold a trump style rally monday night in fayetteville and vice president
