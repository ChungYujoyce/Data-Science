advertisement supported by by patrick healy and farah stockman in high school civics classes the usual assignments about political parties and the electoral college have given way to anguished venting about groping and sexual violence in therapy sessions patients feel triggered and even retraumatized by donald j trump s graphic remarks about women and his boasting about forcing himself on them and getting away with it and in conversations before and after church services the stench of moral decay has stirred discussions about bill clinton s behavior with a white house intern in the 1990s and whether his conduct was actually worse than mr trump s sexual abuse is not something most parishioners thought they d have to think about in this campaign said the rev stephen m koeth a roman catholic priest who assists at the holy trinity church on manhattan s upper west side it is a painful moment in our culture for voters across party lines the presidential race was already ugly already exhausting and already dominated by two candidates many voters found deplorable and yet it somehow managed to tip into something worse in recent days a twilight zone of politics where sexual tawdriness and assault accusations have become consuming issues in the final weeks of the campaign among many democrats despair is setting in that the next president could be in their minds a sexual predator among many republicans disgust is widespread that the next president could be married to a man who was as they see it a serial adulterer at best those negative feelings are intensifying to judge by the increasingly angry crowds at mr trump s rallies and the soul baring support for hillary clinton from michelle obama and others the election result now seems guaranteed to feel like a violation of the body politic for one half of the country or the other i was prepared to find trump s comments about women repulsive but i was not prepared to find the comments cutting so deeply said larry iannotti a psychotherapist in manhattan adding that mr trump s bragging had shaken several of his clients who had suffered abuse the election is suddenly causing real pain that people didn t see coming it was deeply personal for nicole smith a 22 year old in phoenix who was a miss arizona usa contestant she said she was angry that her father and others were voting for mr trump even though they knew she was often groped and harassed herself she always carries a taser she said because she does not feel safe in most places you guys talk about protecting me she recalled telling the men in her life who are supporting mr trump but the fact is you re voting for someone like that so how can you protect me when you re electing someone that you re trying to protect me from in interviews late last week with two dozen voters around the country many were quick to argue even without prompting that either mrs clinton or mr trump was the worst offender on issues of inappropriate behavior toward women not only had sex taken control of the political discussion but sexual conduct itself had become politicized with voters arguing about which kinds of disturbing behavior were worse their responses often reflecting the candidate they supported for some voters mrs clinton s harsh remarks about some women who had been sexually involved with her husband and the thought of mr clinton back in the white house are loathsome mr trump stoked that discomfort last week by publicly appearing with several women who had accused mr clinton of misconduct and by bringing them to the second presidential debate darwin rieck a farmer and trump backer in luzerne iowa said he was dismayed that sexual behavior had become a dimension of the race and accused the clinton campaign and the news media of hyping the issue to hurt mr trump now all we re talking about is his sexual encounters that supposedly he had that s all we re talking about mr rieck said how can the clintons talk about it with what bill has done when he was in office they have no room to be even talking about anything but others were appalled by the comparisons of the clintons and mr trump mrs clinton has not made sexually lewd remarks or been accused of physically harming anyone as mr trump has and it is the trump campaign that has been far more aggressive in throwing mud she has nothing to do with his infidelity said salici robinson a sales associate from white plains referring to mr clinton he s not running for president since the debate when mr trump flatly denied that he had ever made unwanted advances toward women at least nine have come forward to accuse him of groping or kissing them forcefully the spotlight on these allegations has been deeply worrisome to parents who describe struggling to keep their young children from listening to the sordid details but the focus on sexual assault has had other ripple effects as well the number of calls to the nationwide hotline for the rape abuse and incest national network has jumped to about 800 a day from about 600 said scott berkowitz the group s president and founder whenever there is a really high profile media story or case we find that a lot of people who have experienced this months or even years ago but never talked about it it prompts them to reach out for help for the first time he said this topic is being discussed at every workplace and every dinner table mr berkowitz continued it becomes harder for them to escape and more likely for them to talk to someone who understands the allegations against mr trump have followed a white house campaign to end the rape culture on college campuses and address what many students and liberals view as a permissive attitude toward sexual assault some college students said they were stunned that mr trump still enjoyed relatively strong support in spite of his comments about women and the allegations against him but added that many voters had already made up their minds and were unlikely to swing toward mrs clinton solely on the issue of sexual misconduct the idea that a candidate with a major party backing has allegations of this nature on his record is vile said alex abbott 20 a senior at hampden sydney college an all male campus in virginia still he added the responses to mr trump s behavior that mr abbott had heard from men are either i would never do anything like that or every guy does that and it s not out of the ordinary while surveys show voters are chiefly concerned about the economy and terrorism the drumbeat of negative attention on mr trump s sexual behavior is hurting him with female voters and independents according to republican pollsters but support for mrs clinton has not jumped noticeably a sign that many republicans still do not see mr trump as morally unacceptable at least compared with the clintons it s what i have termed negative partisanship alan abramowitz a political science professor at emory university in atlanta wrote in an email we vote against the other party candidate more than for our own party candidate and that is especially true this year for republicans the ill will for mr trump is just as strong among democrats like jon robin baitz an acclaimed broadway playwright whose latest work vicu a explores a tailor s relationship with a blustering trump like candidate and will run this fall at the kirk douglas theater in los angeles my heart is broken mr baitz said there is to me a kind of fundamental american decency and it s just been lost in the prurient shallowness of the discourse for richard rapp a social studies teacher in manhattan civility in politics is not a lost cause at the high school for environmental studies on friday morning he led the seniors in his participation in government class in a lively debate about mr trump and mrs clinton and gently coaxed them to focus on policy positions rather than the mudslinging several students were baffled that mr trump still had a chance at all if you re running for president isn t it disqualifying if you talk disrespectfully about women asked genesis luna a 16 year old from the bronx isn t it disqualifying if you do disrespectful things to women what do you think mr rapp said i think it should be ms luna said but i heard bill clinton treated mistresses badly who s worse bill clinton or trump more students jumped in while mr rapp kept his opinions to himself but later he said that listening to the recording of mr trump bragging about groping had reminded him of watching the senate led hearings on the watergate scandal in 1973 when he was in college a trump victory in november mr rapp said would be tantamount to richard m nixon continuing in the white house despite watergate i have the same feeling now that i had then is this what our government has come to he said if trump wins with all these sexual accusations out there what does that say about us as a country advertisement
