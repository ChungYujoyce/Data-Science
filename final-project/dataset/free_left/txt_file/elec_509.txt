atthelibertarian town hallon cnn earlier this month the libertarian party s presidentialcandidategary johnsonand his running mate bill weldmade a pitchto both never hillary and never trump voters on the left and right of the political spectrum as the sane andprincipled third party alternative for 2016 and whether you agree or disagree with what the two former governorshad to say it s hard to deny their likability especially in an election where the two major party candidates are as thoroughly unlikable as donald trump and hillary clinton johnson and weld presumably have a better shotat appealing to never trump conservatives than never hillary liberals or leftists whose political views align much more with the green party s jill stein but the former new mexico governor did make a compelling pitch superficially at least to disaffected bernie sanders supporters at the town hall and whilepolls indicatethat themajority of the democratic socialist ssupporters will vote for clinton in november there is a minority faction that will be voting their conscience and johnson iscertainly in a position towoo some of these voters with thisundoubtedlyin the back of his mind the libertarian candidatesaid that he and bernie are similar on about 75 percent of what s out there from marriage equality and reproductive rights to the legalization of marijuana and the end of futilemilitary interventions overseas from an economic standpoint however johnson admitted disagreement if bernie supporters are really looking for income equality i don t think that is something that government can accomplish taking from peter to rob paul that s an equation that peter really loves but if bernie supporters are looking for equal opportunity i think that is something that can be accomplished in politics you can definitely stand up for equal opportunity it was a cogent response that included an acknowledgement that crony capitalism is alive and well something that libertarians and leftists have long agreed on and equally object to but apart from this johnson s economic worldview is diametrically opposed to sanders egalitarianvision of social democracy and this should be enough to stop the latter s supporters from voting for the former in the economic realm right wing libertarians asopposed to leftlibertarians or libertarian socialists are essentiallyclassical economic liberalswho reject most of the social democratic reforms that were enacted throughout the capitalist world during the 20th century instead of a mixed economy libertariansadvocate laissez faire capitalism and profess that even minimal stateintervention inthe economywilllead to tyranny orserfdom as the famouslibertarian philosopher f a hayek put it in hisinfluential book the road to serfdom this didn t pan out of course instead it was the welfare state that likely prevented more radical assaults on capitalism in the west in his statement johnson said that he doesn tbelieve thatthe government canreduce economic inequality whichhas soared over the past forty years and equatedredistributive measures to theft thisalone reveals thecandidatesdogmatic worldview thesocial democratic reforms of the 20th century clearly demonstratethat wealth and income inequalitycanbe curbed within acapitalist economy andshouldbe if leaders want toachieve greatereconomic and political stability whilejohnson is less fanaticalthan some of his party colleagues indeed he is consideredtoomoderate by many libertarians he is still undoubtedly the most extreme candidate of 2016on economic matters he opposes corporate taxation supports privatized healthcare advocates eliminating the progressive income tax andreplacing them with a regressive consumption tax and is a proponent of widespread economic deregulation and privatization including theprivatization of prisons libertarianismmay sound good on paper championing individualism andmaximumfreedom but in practice its laissez faire prescriptions would result in corporate tyranny the very opposite of freedom libertarians are so consumed with the threat ofstate tyranny that they seem unable to evenconsider the very real threat of private tyranny or asnoam chomsky has describedit tyranny byunaccountable private concentrations of wealth g a cohen the father ofanalytical marxismandnotable critic of libertarianism discussedhowprivate property actually inhibitsthe freedom of the ownerlessin his essay capitalism freedom proletariat private property like any system of rights pretty wellisa particular way of distributing freedomand unfreedom it is necessarily associated with the liberty of private owners to do as they wish with what they own but it no less necessarily withdraws liberty from those who do not own it to think of capitalism as a realm of freedom is to overlook halfof its nature now there was a timewhen the rugged individualism andminimal state interventionthat libertarians advocate could have conceivably produced a greater degree of freedom namely in a pre capitalist pre industrial economy before the prevalence of wage labor and the advent of multinational corporations when independent producers e g yeoman farmers artisans etc whosoldtheir own commodities on the market or simply produced forsubsistence were the dominant economic players butin a modern corporate capitalist economyin whichthe richest 20 citizens control morewealth thanthe bottom half about 152 million people in america these notions are not only antiquated but inimicaltoboth freedom and democracy thus a berniesanders supporterwould have to begrossly uninformed to go from backing the democratic socialist senatorto a libertarian like johnson yes there are similarities between the two but their political philosophies are so antithetical to each other particularlywhen it comes topolitical economy that the single issues where there is some agreement are basically irrelevant
