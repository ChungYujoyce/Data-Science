within his purview to make the decisions about who he d like serving in his cabinet gabbard s most recent fox hit took place on monday night where she spent the eve of the new hampshire primary with sean hannity and complained that her fellow democrats were afraid to come on this show during the interview she called for democratic national committee chairman tom perez to resign due to the iowa

cnn or any outlet that allows her to get her message out to voters democrats shouldn t ignore fox news watchers and she will take her unifying message to any network willing to take it she made the same point in an interview with the hill last month saying it s important to share this diversity of views and not just shut out a huge segment of the population just in general for me i m running for president and asking for the opportunity to serve all americans in this country they re giving me a platform to speak to millions of people one of whom is donald trump to deliver this really important
