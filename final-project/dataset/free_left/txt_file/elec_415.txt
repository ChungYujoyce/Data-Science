advertisement supported by by trip gabriel ames iowa it probably made sense on paper invite presidential candidates to visit the iowa republican party s tent in the parking lot before the big iowa vs iowa state football game on saturday what planners did not anticipate was the portable mob scene that characterizes the candidacy of donald j trump arriving more than an hour late mr trump offered a speech of less than a minute on the state party s stage but that was beside the point as star struck supporters greeted him like a stadium rocker during a sprawling tailgate party before kickoff donald you rock a young man shouted as mr trump encircled by a security team walked through a parking lot another man fought his way into the mob and said donald i m wearing your hat shook his hand i shook his hand a burly student shouted to two friends sounding faint with excitement three other republican candidates not named trump also glad handed and posed for selfies among the tailgating football fans before the game but their receptions were of a different order rarely has the contrast between a conventional politician and the celebrity candidacy of mr trump seemed clearer history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling many iowa republicans expected mr trump s lead in the primary race to be fleeting on friday night a seasoned party activist compared him to the bad boy you date over the summer before returning to college instead mr trump continues to dominate iowa polls as summer turns to fall a quinnipiac university poll of iowa last week showed he is the first choice of all age groups of republicans including young people who predominated outside jack trice stadium where the iowa state cyclones hosted the iowa hawkeyes we re killing everybody in the polls mr trump said in brief remarks from the stage he wore a new make america great again hat this one in camouflage he wished people luck with whichever team they supported stepped down and began the walk back to his s u v a knot of students and others pressing close though he said nothing about the issues of the day the audience seemed satisfied it was pretty cool we got to see him said braiden loreno a sophomore i m definitely voting for him the crowd of several hundred had waited more than an hour for mr trump they had chanted don ald don ald cheers went up several times over false sightings a sign read the trump will set you free it was countered by a protester s sign mr hate leave my state at 2 30 the appointed hour for mr trump to speak a candidate appeared and the crowd parted to reveal gov scott walker of wisconsin running late there was no applause for mr walker who for months had led in the polls in iowa but whose popularity in the quinnipiac poll was measured at 3 percent in brief remarks mr walker promised to wreak havoc on washington as he had in wisconsin when he faced down thousands of pro union protesters mr walker s abbreviated version of his stump speech also included a veiled swipe at mr trump it takes more than just talk he said it takes action actions speak louder than words earlier senators marco rubio of florida and rand paul of kentucky worked the tailgaters not all of whom were thrilled to have a presidential candidate and his entourage interfering with their meat grilling beer drinking and game playing come on bro this is a tailgate dionne harden an iowa state fan protested as mr rubio walked in front of him just as he was about to toss a bean bag in a tent sponsored by the iowa corn growers association mr rubio faced a different kind of challenge when he was pressed on whether he supported federal support for ethanol as i ve said before i understand if people made an investment in something you re not going to just take it away from them mr rubio told a group of farmers but eventually i do believe these energy resources have to be self sustaining jerry mohr a farmer who is chairman of the growers association called mr rubio s position disappointing mr rubio made a better impression on evan monson an iowa state junior who praised him for hanging out at the sigma pi fraternity tailgate party rubio was pretty cool he said mr paul had also spoken free market truth to the corn industry in iowa he visited the growers tent and strolled the parking lots with a more manageable level of attention than mr trump offered a beer mr paul pleaded that he had to fly to st louis later to present a homemakers award to his mother at a gathering of the eagle forum the conservative group founded by phyllis schlafly scott scheidel an insurance broker called out to mr paul you re my man come over to my tailgate i ll give you the microphone he said mr paul greeted him but moved on another fan keven malec who had driven from illinois to visit a daughter at iowa state offered mr paul a choice of two sandwiches he was grilling we ve got a cyclone and we ve got a hawkeye he said i don t want to take sides but the hawkeye tastes like chicken but it was mr trump who dominated the show at a rally earlier in the day mr trump had criticized ben carson the retired surgeon who has surged in iowa polls to claim second place for being too mild mannered to occupy the oval office i don t think ben has the energy mr trump said ben is a nice man but when you re negotiating against china and you re negotiating against these japanese guys that are going to come against you in waves and they think we re all a bunch of jerks because our leaders are so stupid and so incompetent and so inept we need people that are really smart that have tremendous deal making skills and that have great great energy his visit to the ames tailgate scene though short was memorable after his remarks he made his way through the parking lot then climbed into a waiting black suburban he rolled down his window and as he shot out his arm to wave goodbye a diamond cuff link sparkled in the sun advertisement
