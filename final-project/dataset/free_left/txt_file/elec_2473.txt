ben carson briefly rocketed to the top of the iowa polls mr cruz and his team stayed cool confident that the neurosurgeon s support would wither but after months of assiduously following his playbook with expected rivals for evangelical and tea party support exiting the race or languishing in the polls mr cruz is being forced to confront the election season s great mystery how do you solve a problem like donald trump for days mr cruz convinced at last that mr trump will not tire from throwing punches has been testing several strategies in succession true to form when dealing with mr trump the path has been complicated during a long bus tour of iowa mr cruz noted that he lacked a plane with his name on it a barely veiled effort to cast mr trump as anathema to the iowa way of retail campaigning but then the state s six term republican governor terry branstad who preaches to presidential candidates the importance of visiting all of iowa s 99 counties urged mr cruz s defeat according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president mr cruz has described mr trump as someone who s a dealmaker who will capitulate to the washington establishment on wednesday in hollis n h he said insiders were abandoning marco rubio to support mr trump because he unlike mr cruz would not interfere with their gravy train but the establishment label has shown few immediate signs of sticking to a rival better known for business threats lawsuits and a go it alone style than for seeking consensus most pointedly mr cruz has detailed mr trump s long history of liberal positions and contributions to democratic boogeymen from the clintons to mayor rahm emanuel of chicago but this line of attack and mr cruz s broader case that conservatives are coalescing around him were undercut at least briefly by sarah palin s endorsement of mr trump on tuesday even today the g o p machine they re attacking their own front runner mrs palin the running mate of john mccain in 2008 said alongside mr trump on wednesday in tulsa okla adding not every conservative has had the guts to talk about the real issues it would be difficult to suggest that a figure so ridiculed by the political class as mrs palin is part of the washington cartel that mr cruz inveighs against and he has not tried this was not the campaign mr cruz expected since his 2012 run for the senate in texas and through his fights in washington mr cruz has portrayed himself as an uncompromising conservative and his opponents as enablers of a corrupt establishment but that neat white hat black hat construct has been scrambled by the rise of mr trump a candidate willing to go even further outside the traditional bounds of political conduct notably mr cruz s aides do not appear so unnerved by mr trump that they feel compelled to run commercials attacking him even in iowa where mr trump has pulled even with mr cruz in the polls senior aides to mr cruz said wednesday that they had no immediate plans to go after mr trump on television for now mr cruz is seizing on mr trump s absence from the critical fights especially over immigration that have defined the senator s congressional career history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling i would suggest mr cruz said here on monday testing the message before voters for the first time you have reason to doubt the credibility of the promises of a political candidate who discovers the issue after he announces for president perhaps the surest sign of mr cruz s bind has been his sharpening tone after months not only demurring but scolding reporters who invited him to take shots at mr trump mr cruz abruptly changed course last week he derisively said mr trump embodied new york values poked fun at his knowledge of foreign affairs and suggested that he was taking his cues from democrats mr cruz said those remarks merely signaled a new phase of the race as if he were responding to the calendar but the escalation also came after mr trump had made an issue of mr cruz s canadian birth questioning his eligibility for the presidency and disparaged mr cruz s personality yet while mr cruz pledges to contrast himself with mr trump only on matters of policy he has ventured into far more personal territory calling mr trump rattled and nervous he has portrayed mr trump as unsteady fixated on social media and his own popularity in terms of a commander in chief we ought to have someone who isn t springing out of bed to tweet in a frantic response to the latest polls mr cruz said in fort mill s c while mr cruz cited a poll showing him defeating mr trump head to head in a crowded republican field he remains well behind in most national surveys asked in an interview if other candidates needed to drop out for mr trump to lose mr cruz said as a practical matter the field is winnowing already he played down any particular focus on mr trump s followers reporters sometimes you know ask suspiciously are you trying to take donald trump s supporters he said absolutely every single one of them and i m trying to take every one of jeb bush s supporters and chris christie s and marco rubio s and everyone else but it is clear mr cruz s attention is focused on the man he spent much of 2015 bathing in praise at a town hall meeting wednesday in exeter n h mr cruz suggested mr trump had kowtowed to the iowa political establishment by favoring subsidies for the ethanol industry the day before mr cruz sought to exploit the issue in a fund raising plea saying that mr branstad had called for his defeat because he and one of his sons were protecting subsidies the longest serving republican career politician in the nation and his politically connected family mr cruz wrote is coordinating with establishment politicians and super pacs to lead an 11th hour attack against us and sink our campaign advertisement
