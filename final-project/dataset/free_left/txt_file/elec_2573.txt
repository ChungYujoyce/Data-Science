it seems like a million years ago when democratic supporters of bernie sanders andhillary clinton were furiously debating the merits of the superdelegate system it happens almost every time and it never gets less stupid while defending superdelegates is never a popular position to take on social media the value of the system and its distant cousin the electoral college couldnotbe more obvious during this current general election all we need to do is to observe the shrieking wild eyed uncorked flailing that s taking place among supporters of donald trump both online and off and the need for firewalls against ignorant populism becomes abundantly self evident as much as we like to think of ourselves as wise and rational people we too often require protection from ourselves everything from traffic laws to food labels andterm limits are designed as strictures against the human penchant for self destruction indeed the constitution and the system of government it outlines is built upon checking the worst instincts of human nature especially the unquenchable appetite for total power the framers therefore constructed a system in which every structure is checked and balanced with the sole purpose of thwarting too much centralized power and fostering stability in the face of popular whimsy we ll never know if james madison and the authors of the constitution were prescient enough to forecast a trump candidacy but we know they were deeply concerned about the hazards of direct democracy hence the establishment of the electoral college as a bulwark against destabilizing figures with the charisma to easily manipulate low information voters alexander hamilton wrote in federalist no 68 about the dangers of directly electing presidential candidates who possess talents for low intrigue and the little arts of popularity sounds a lot like trump so the framers adapted the roman collegium electorum into a system in which voters choose slates of electors appointed for each party and equal to the respective state s congressional representation rather than directly voting for presidential candidates technically abouthalf of all electors are required by law or party rules to cast their ballots for the winner of their state s popular vote theoretically though electors can break ranks and vote for the other candidate the hope is that electors won t have to deny the popular vote to stop an existentially dangerous candidate and they never have but it s nice to know there s a method for doing so in case of a maniac s rise to power likewise the democratic party beginning in 1984 chose to implement a primary firewall the superdelegate system as a means of blocking similarly frivolous candidates from winning the nomination unqualified or downright scandalous candidates who might look great to radicals and extremists but whowould be a disaster in the general election together both systems provide fail safe mechanisms that while seldom if ever used offer insurance policies against trump like figures or worse who prey upon our natural biases and impulsiveness trump may not know it but he s done the founding fathers a service by successfully vindicated the existence of both institutions i d bet a month s salary that he doesn t even know how the electoral college works anyway the republican party if it s at all interested in blocking another trump ish fiasco would do well to set up its own superdelegate system even if it never has to use it but it s fair to suggest that many republicans wish onewasalready in place superdelegates as controversial as they are wouldhave potentially thwarted trump s nomination and with it many bleeding ulcers more important itwould shield the rest of us from a similarly destabilizing character whose entire strategy is built upon pandering and ridiculousness i m not sure the gop is self aware or self critical enough to appoint its own superdelegates but the rest of the world would be more than grateful for it believe me we never thought it could happen like this but trump has managed to climb to the very brink of acquiring absolute power propelled by upward of the 40 percent of american voters whohave been deceived by appeals to their worst human instincts and the lure of populist bromides delivered to them with the mastery of a professional television celebrity while trump s no longer favored to win it doesn t matter he s already thoroughly beclowned american democracy by his very existence as the gop nominee appearing on television every day with his ludicrous conspiracy theories his childish name calling and his disgustingly misogynistic gropings collectively his 40 percent support ought to be enough to trigger a rethinking of the gop s primary process if for no other reason than to re marginalize the poorly educated voters whose racism and formerly unfocused rage have led them to blindly pledge their loyalty to this reality show clown this saturday morning cartoon villain and designate him as presidential material to further illustrate why the framers were wise to set up a check on mob rule there s this the man in the above video is fairly indicative of the automatons who have elevated trump to this point the very fact that he thinks taking out hillary clinton is his patriotic duty proves that perhaps it s a smart idea to create a buffer between him and directly choosing presidential candidates oh and he s far from beingthe only one even though i disagree with trump on every issue my chief objection isn t simply about policy my visceral grievances with trump have more to do with his lack of character his total lack of qualifications and his terrifying disrespect for the rules and traditions of american presidential politics the latter being the wafer thin fabric that holds this entire american experiment together making his complete disregard for the rules written and unwritten the greatest threat to the american system if events go horribly awry and the election swings in his direction at the 11th hour the fear of a trump presidency isn t strictly limited to hisproposal for building a wall or i don t know nominating omarosa to the supreme court the real fear has to do with the millions of impulsive knee jerk things that we can t even begin to predict and the next trump will be even more devious about his or her demagoguery there will surely be more trumps knowing that thestyle of the current republican nominee has led him to a point in which he hasoccasionally flirted within the margin of error more than once trumpism is on the loose now and even a humiliating loss onnov 8won t make it go away and the next purveyor of it will likely learn from trump s mistakes and improve his or her chances therefore it s incumbent upon the gop to make sure it puts down this white nationalist monster it s created by making sure another trump doesn t end up at large suffice to say i m not holding my breath ultimately if you ve been skeptical or downright opposed to both superdelegates and the electoral college look no further than trump and tell us how else the next one will be stopped without either knowing that there are tens of millions of american voters who are absolutely cool with the idea of a president trump bob cesca is a regular contributor to salon he s also the host of the bob cesca show podcast and a weekly guest on both
