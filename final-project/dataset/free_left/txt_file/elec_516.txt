the big idea scott walker believed that surviving the recall prepared him for the rigors and scrutiny that come with running for president he was wrong winning three elections in four years in a blue state like wisconsin clouded his judgment and made him overconfident in his own abilities he shuffled off to his super pac some of his closest long term advisers who helped him get onto the national stage from there they could not coordinate with him he surrounded himself with an oversized entourage that didn t seem to understand what made him tick he wound up looking like a flip flopper who was not ready for prime time and who was constantly telling audiences what they wanted to hear sign up to get the daily 202 delivered to your e mail inbox walker seemed to blame donald trump last night for changing the dynamic in the race and causing him to drop out but he and his own senior staff deserve more blame than anyone else here are five of the reasons walker blew his very real chance to be the gop nominee 1 he came across as inauthentic trump is leading in the polls because conservatives think he tells it like it is even if they don t agree with him on every issue or find some of what he says offensive walker who has never held a real job outside politics made himself look like a career politician with constant punts and recalibrations it always felt like he had his finger in the wind and was studying the polls a little too closely the post reporter on the walker beat jenna johnson seemed to always be filing stories on how the governor was trying to clarify his position on this or that he flip flopped on ethanol to try winning over iowa agriculture interests he flipped on immigration taking a hard line to match the mood of the moment and to have an issue with which he could contrast himself from the right with jeb bush and marco rubio he seemed to endorse ending birthright citizenship last month then he said he didn t have a position on the issue then he said that he did not want to change the constitution which many believe guarantees citizenship to those born on u s soil over labor day weekend he refused to say if the u s should accept more syrian refugees telling reporters that it was a hypothetical question and that he wanted to talk about reality only to say soon after that the united states should not accept more refugees 2 he was out of his depth on both foreign and domestic policy at a club for growth donor meeting this spring he appeared not to understand what was actually in dodd frank financial regulatory reform or the ins and outs of the export import bank two issues big in washington but not wisconsin he claimed that ronald reagan firing the air traffic controllers was the most significant foreign policy decision of my lifetime even supporters couldn t believe when he likened taking on the islamic state to taking on big labor if i can take on 100 000 protesters i can do the same across the world he said at cpac in february 3 he seemed unserious and thus unpresidential on meet the press last month when chuck todd asked scott walker about building a wall along the northern border with canada walker responded that s a legitimate issue for us to look at then a few days later he said he never supported the idea and blamed the media for twisting his words members of his team thought they were being really clever when they had him announce he d cancel the chinese state dinner if he was president they went out on a limb assuming others would follow instead he got mocked by conservative thought leaders who said he looked na ve 4 he never picked a lane it was not clear if walker was trying to be the evangelical candidate the tea party candidate the establishment alternative to bush or something else trying to be all things to all people made him seem indecisive he didn t take a position on evolution afraid of alienating social conservatives he said early in the year that he didn t know if obama was a christian several months later asked the same question he said he still did not know 5 he staffed up way too much way too fast a recent count put the number of full time walker campaign staff at around 90 including a full time photographer he spent the springrolling out the names of consultants he hired in the early states before he had demonstrated that he could put together a finance operation to pay their salaries walker wrongly assumed that donors who had given to him during the recall fight would naturally support his presidential campaign he was out of practice atrunning against other republicans the highest highs and lowest lows walker led in early iowa polls after a breakout performance in january but he got less speaking time than every other candidate on stage at last week s debate in february the wisconsin governor actually had the largest share of the gop presidential chatter across all forms of media more than one in four mentions of any republican contender on twitter television or online media that month was about walker but that number fell sharply as the field grew and walker was left behind as this graphic fromouranalytics partners at zignal labs illustrates who benefits the most from walker dropping out establishment types turned to walker because they didn t like jeb will they settle for the former florida governor now or will they look to someone else the scramble is on for his donors aides to jeb started approaching top walker bundlers after walker failed to break out in last week s gop debate urging them to jump ship matea gold and sean sullivan report deep pocketed contributors helped unintimidated pac raise 20 million in less than two months this spring the super pac was on track to raise an additional 15 million to 20 million by the end of the year according to a republican with intimate knowledge of the operation among donors there is no clear consensus about who to go with now among the favorites mentioned in phone conversations are rubio fiorina john kasich and chris christie bush is seen as having less appeal in part because many of walker s backers view him as insufficiently conservative

a chinese american internet summit set to occur during xi s visit to seattle with accusations that chinese officials strong armed u s tech titans into attending a minor meet and greet in seattle

catholic faith and abortion rights coexist by jennifer steinhauer for representative nancy pelosi the issue of abortion rights has always been ancillary to her unwavering faith and deep approbation for generations of popes i actually agree with the pope on more issues than many catholics who agree with him on one issue ms pelosi said in an interview but that one issue abortion is adding a thick layer of tension to the otherwise convivial mood as congress prepares for the arrival of pope francis this week if they republicans think they are making the pope more welcome by putting abortion measures on the legislative calendar the week he is in washington they are mistaken pelosi said the pope is his own reason for ms pelosi the notion of disagreeing with other catholics about abortion has not weighed on her sense of faith i think everyone grants everyone their position she said the church has their position and we have ours which is that a woman has free will given to her by god my family is very pro life she added noting that she has lived with the conflict all her life roll call members will be blocked 2 ways from touching pope francis by david hawkings too many members cannot be trusted to behave themselves when pope francis comes to the capitol the congressional leadership has decided and so to enforce decorous discipline some extraordinary measures are being readied each party is assembling teams of lawmakers to essentially act as blocking tackles willing to restrain any of their colleagues intent on trying to reach out for a papal touch as he walks onto the floor of the house and after the historic speech the doors to the cloakrooms and the hallways will be blocked and in some cases locked to prevent lawmakers from leaving the chamber for perhaps half an hour until francis has appeared on a west front balcony to greet the ticketed throng and then departed the hill by motorcade leadership is looking for about 50 members known for their patience and institutional good manners on the promise they ll keep their hands to themselves they ll be assigned to wear dark colors with hems below the knee for women as papal protocol dictates show up when the doors open and fill the three chairs on either side of the aisle in each of the chamber s eight rows of fixed seating vox com s matthew yglesias not exactly a gop primary voter makes the argumentthat rubio is a better bet for the gop than jeb one key reason is that while i personally am of the school of thought that outsider candidates like trump and carson face much longer odds than their current standing in the polls implies there are no sure things in politics it s at least conceivable that one of those guys or ted cruz really could sweep the field george mcgovern and jimmy carter for example both won democratic party nominations over the objections of party insiders all the conventional candidates in the field have something of an obligation to ensure that they don t collectively do so much to divide the establishment that they let an outsider in call itlow energy or blame thelack of support from his mother but from day one every aspect of bush s campaign not directly related to fundraising has been unimpressive marco rubio by contrast is a dynamic public speaker and gutsy political risk taker and crucially rubio has the exact same policy positions as bush wall street

government is an immediate threat from gallup almost half of americans 49 say the federal government poses an immediate threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens similar to what was found in previous surveys conducted over the last five years when this question was first asked in 2003 less than a third of americans held this attitude the remarkable finding about these attitudes is how
