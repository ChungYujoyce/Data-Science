please read our updated privacy notice and terms of use effective on december 19 2019 the unexpected rise of donald trump exposed divisions within the gop but their third presidential debate displayed a republican party that is closing ranks the dynamic was not immediately apparent indeed at first the opposite appeared to be the case when ohio governor john kasich launched a huntsman esque tirade against the fantasy plans circulated by donald trump and ben carson but kasich quickly faded from the scene and his positioning of himself as the champion of reality based governance fell flat indeed judging the performance by body language alone kasich appeared to be the twitching neurotic and his colleagues smooth andassured the general lack of disagreement between the candidates gave special drama to the one largely content free showdown between rubio and jeb bush in that set piece bush mustered all the feigned indignation he could to confront rubio with his high number of missed senate votes a figure that is neither unusual for a senator running for president nor has resulted in any noticeably different outcomes rubio dispatched bush with a tone so understated and almost pitying it marked the instant and widely acknowledged death of bush s hopes rubio now inherits from the vanquished bush the role of champion of bushonomics and the general bush strategy of combining folksy personal appeals tiny dollops of policy for the working class liberal instincts on immigration and a fanatical devotion to the policy agenda of the party s donor class rubio is more like george w bush than jeb bush ever was by the time the campaign is over not only will all of jeb s donors have defected to rubio poppy bush may be signing over jeb s share of the family inheritance torubio the debate allowed the candidates mostly to agree with each other and against the moderators whom they especially resented for their intrusions of reality a recurring trope was for candidates when presented with uncomfortable facts to simply deny them becky quick you d have to cut you d have to cut government about 40 percent to make it work with a 1 1 trillion hole ben carson that s nottrue quick went on to quote donald trump calling marco rubio mark zuckerberg s personal senator a quote trump denied so staunchly and convincingly that quick apologized despite being utterly correct later john harwood asked rubio about the proportionately higher benefit his plan would give to the richest earners versus people in the middle harwoodasked the tax foundation which was alluded to earlier scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after tax income to the top one percent as to people in the middle of the income scale since you re the champion of americans living paycheck to paycheck don t you have thatbackward this description is completely true the tax foundation a right wing group analyzed rubio s plan and found that the richest one percent would get an 11 5 percent increase in their after tax income as opposed to a 1 7 percent increase in after tax income for taxpayers in the middle of the income distribution because it is a right wing group the tax foundation also prepared a dynamic analysis assuming the most fervent dreams of supply side economics would hold true that analysis the numbers from which harwood used perhaps as a concession to rubio found that the middle would get a 15 percent increase in after tax income and the top one percent a 27 9 percentincrease rubio denied it flat out no that s you re wrong first he answered by stating that his plan would give a bigger percentage increase in after tax income for earners at the bottom a different comparison from the one made by harwood who focused on the middle then he tried to say that his plan merely gave higher total dollar amounts to the rich because they earn more yeah but that because the math is if you 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand so yeah someone who makes more money numerically it s gonna be higher rubio was arguing that his plan merely gives higher dollar amounts of tax cuts to the rich because they pay more to begin with but that was not harwood s claim harwood said the tax foundation found rubio gave a proportionally higher cut to the richest earners than the middle income earners which is factuallytrue this is the sort of exchange that will be replayed endlessly in the general election since the entire republican field is unified on the necessity of regressive debt financed tax cuts as the centerpiece of their economic strategy predictably when the subject changed from revenue to outlay the candidates moods shifted suddenly from the insouciant conviction that the budget can withstand the loss of trillions of dollars in revenue to rabid parsimony all the retirement programs are going broke in dire need of cutting for younger people not for current recipients and backed by worthless ious republicans agree that no connection can be made between the federal government s revenue levels and the levels of social spending it can afford tomaintain what the candidates agreed upon above all else is that any intrusions into their alternate reality represent a gross offense by the liberal media media bashing provided the most popular subject for contemporaneous sermons a foolproof way for candidates to bat down any inconvenient query and win wild applause from the partisan crowd the currents of anti establishment rage that had seemed to roil the debate were at least for one night drowned out by satisfiedunity he s a well known lover of the truth for loeffler a lot of damage has already been done the justice department notified three senators on tuesday that it will not pursue insider trading charges against them after an investigation into stock transactions from the early days of the coronavirus pandemic did not find sufficient evidence they had broken the law according to a person briefed on the investigations the department contacted lawyers for senators kelly loeffler republican of georgia james inhofe republican of oklahoma and dianne feinstein democrat of california all threehad sold substantial amounts of stockin late january or early february when lawmakers were being briefed on the novel coronavirus threat but before the pandemic began roiling financial markets or was fully understood by the public law enforcement officials appear to still be investigating senator richard m burr republican of north carolina whose own mid february stock sales have drawn scrutiny from the justice department and securities and exchange commission last week f b i agentsseized mr burr s cellphone good news out of new york katie miller the highest profile trump administration member to have contracted coronavirus is doing better a real sign of the times georgia s governor bids for the rnc amid talk that charlotte might not host after all there needs to be something for democrats to panic about and right now this is it in early april jason furman a top economist in the obama administration and now a professor at harvard was speaking via zoom to a large bipartisan group of top officials from both parties the economy had just been shut down unemployment was spiking and some policymakers were predicting an era worse than the great depression the economic carnage seemed likely to doom president donald trump s chances at reelection furman tapped to give the opening presentation looked into his screen of poorly lit boxes of frightened wonks and made a startling claim we are about to see the best economic data we ve seen in the history of this country he said the former cabinet secretaries and federal reserve chairs in the zoom boxes were confused though some of the republicans may have been newly relieved and some of the democrats suddenly concerned everyone looked puzzled and thought i had misspoken furman said in an interview instead of forecasting a prolonged depression level economic catastrophe furman laid out a detailed case for why the months preceding the november election could offer trump the chance to brag truthfully about the most explosive monthly employment numbers and gdp growth ever risk public health or else president donald trump on monday morning threatened to move august s republican national convention out of north carolina unless there are guarantees the state will let everyone attend i love the great state of north carolina so much so that i insisted on having the republican national convention in charlotte at the end of august unfortunately democrat governor roycoopernc is still in shutdown mood unable to guarantee that by august we will be allowed full attendance in the arena he began in a string of four tweets the rncis scheduled to be held in charlotte on aug 24 27 less than a week after democrats are set to wrap up their rescheduled convention in milwaukee it s not clear where the republican convention might be moved or how easily that could be done on relatively short notice and this is only part of why the way too late european travel ban was a complete disaster the europe restrictions followed six weeks later but unleashed chaos in ways that surpassed even that of the muslim ban current and former officials said key agencies including the departments of homeland security and transportation had no meaningful input in the nature of the europe restrictions or how and when they would be executed an administration official said officials from both agencies were present at meetings where the ban was discussed the administration scrambled to round up contractors to conduct temperature checks on tens of thousands of passengers officials said the magnitude of the mobilization was unprecedented even so the contractors were overrun by the rush of travelers that trump had helped unleash even the most basic screening steps seemed to backfire the cdc failed to distribute a new paper questionnaire in time for it to be shared with airlines in advance meaning passengers had to fill it out upon arrival as a result travelers found themselves reaching around one another for slips of paper and pencils risking transmission as the bottlenecks got worse already a subscriber log in or link your magazine subscription
