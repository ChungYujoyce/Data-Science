the libertarian party nominee can benefit from trump s fall but only if he can convince republicans and democrats that he can really be commander in chief how does gary johnson the libertarian nominee for president currently averaging around 7 percent in national polls plan to benefit from pussygate the release of disturbing audio of donald trump discussing his treatment of women in an interview conducted the day after the second presidential debate listen here he tells me disgruntled and disgusted republicans are now coming his way despite his staunch support of abortion rights marriage equality open borders and pot legalization and given ongoing revelations from wikileaks that show hillary clinton s fondness for holding radically different positions in private and public he s targeting hypocrisy wherever he finds it but if he s going to do more than simply cover the growing spread between clinton and trump the former two term republican governor of new mexico is also going to have reverse the perception that he is out of his depth when it comes to foreign policy and commanding the military alone among the leading candidates in calling for cuts in defense spending and restraint and skepticism when it comes military interventions he s also made high profile gaffes related to foreign affairs and has been likened to don knotts the actor famous for playing hapless nebbishy characters in sitcoms such as the andy griffith show and movies such as the shakiest gun in the west until doubts about his foreign policy acumen are overcome it will be an uphill climb even for a 63 year old triathlete who s climbed mt everest we ll get to foreign policy but first let s note that trump s apparent free fall gives johnson an opening especially with traditionalist gop voters who are barely putting up with the billionaire in the first place i have never engaged in that sort of conversation that degrades women johnson tells me adding that those who do should not be aspiring to becoming president of the united states when the trump tape surfaced johnson issued a strongly worded condemnation that reminded folks of his former party affiliation millions of republicans are facing a moment of truth as a former republican governor i don t envy them in a report from albuquerque s koat he claimed that dozens of gop officials had contacted his campaign after the tapes surfaced saying that they wanted to know how to help his effort he reiterated that in our interview but declined to give any specific names when i pressed him naming names of those politicians who are considering endorsing us and i have to believe many of them will i m going to protect the innocent for now he said it s totally plausible that republican voters disgusted by trump would decide to cast their ballots for him his promise to submit a balanced budget via spending cuts to congress within 100 days of taking office has always appealed to fiscal conservatives and his tax cutting penny pinching record in new mexico and that of his running mate bill weld a two term republican governor of massachusetts might make up for the ticket s apostasies on social issues but until at least some of those dozens of gop officials go public with their support it s not clear how much difference it will make indeed throughout the race so far most polls actually showed johnson pulling more support from clinton than trump clinton has even targeted johnson as a threat especially among millennials where her support is relatively soft and his has been relatively strong as trump falls johnson s appeal to voters leaning toward clinton might rise especially if they now see her lead as safe thus allowing them to cast a protest vote revelations by wikileaks from the so called podesta emails portray clinton in a harsh light with her telling private audiences that we need to resist protectionism and other kinds of barriers to market access and to trade even as she has become increasingly critical of both the north american free trade agreement nafta and the trans pacific partnership tpp despite campaigning on a promise to expand old age entitlements such as medicare and social security in other settings she said the government needs to restrain spending and embrace the reform framework put forth by the commission run by alan simpson and erskine bowles which called for cuts to benefits during the most recent presidential debate she didn t disown those views and instead stumbled through an explanation of her belief that you need both a public and a private position on important policy questions hypocrisy is the one unforgivable thing saying one thing and doing another johnson tells me pointing toward both trump and clinton as prime examples i ve always lived by the credo that if you tell the truth you don t have to remember anything you acknowledge mistakes and there s no quicker way to fix them by acknowledging them the talk of owning mistakes brings us to johnson and foreign policy in early september he blanked on a question about aleppo syria on msnbc by daily beast contributor mike barnicle his puzzled response what is aleppo became a twitter joke and meme not long after that he stumbled when asked by chris matthews to name a foreign leader he admires and compounded the problem by saying he was having an aleppo moment such gaffes didn t just confirm the worst fears of conservative and liberal hawks i spoke recently with a millennial journalist who voted for johnson in 2012 is a dedicated nevertrumper and doesn t want to vote for clinton this time around he even agrees with johnson s skepticism toward military interventions but he s worried that the guy has no idea of what s going on outside america s borders the one thing that would bring him around to johnson he said was if the former governor showed some depth when discussing foreign policy when i raise this with johnson he dismisses the idea that being able to rattle off the names of world leaders and geographic locations is any sort of sign that your military strategies are worth a damn he emphatically takes exception to the idea he couldn t identify north korean dictator kim jong un or a single foreign leader he admires insisting i still can t name a leader i really respect but i m talking specifically here about hillary clinton he says the idea that being able to dot i s and cross t s on names and places qualifies you to put our men and servicewomen in harm s way is pure bunk he says they end up dying hurt maimed psychologically impacted for the rest of their lives and hundreds of thousands of innocent people end up dying in these conflicts that s what upsets me so much he continues we need a skeptic in the white house to actually untangle all of what is happening in the world when it comes to syria johnson stresses that because he s not receiving national security he can only guess at all the promises that the united states has made to various factions but that the only way out is to join hands with russia diplomatically you may not agree with his particular solutions to particular situations but he doesn t come across as barney fife in conversation he argues that our interventions in the 21st century have left the middle east and central asia less stable failed to achieve goals partly because goals were never clearly established and that military spending which is still 50 percent higher in real dollars than it was in 2001 can be cut without sacrificing homeland security he s insistent also that congress step up and do its job of actually authorizing wars and paying for them last week johnson gave a major foreign policy speech that was as substantive as it was little noted it turns out that third party candidates are more popular with the press when they are goofy than when they are credible that speech goes a long way toward addressing the perception that johnson is a gadfly even as it sharpens the distance between options such as hillary clinton who has a track record of supporting virtually every intervention of the past 20 years and donald trump who talks promiscuously of bombing the shit out of countries and calling for torture of terrorists show me an america with less debt greater economic strength and robust trade relationships across the globe and i will show you a safer more secure america said johnson in his speech terrorism and the threat from extremists are real but our approach to those threats must be real as well the notion that we will someday celebrate v i day victory over isis is both naive and misleading it won t happen what must and i believe will happen is that we focus our resources on isolating the extremists containing them and starving them of the funds and support they must have to mount large scale attacks tens of thousands of boots on the ground won t do it dropping bombs on the other side of the globe won t do it and pretending that some military style global war on terror will bring about a clear victory is not realistic whether such an approach allows johnson to pull republican voters disgusted by donald trump s generally unhinged behavior on the one hand and ongoing revelations about hillary clinton s policy hypocrisy on the other is an open question but there s little question that the libertarian has followed his own counsel owned his mistakes and put forth a set of proposals worth taking seriously
