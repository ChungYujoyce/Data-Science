the republican presidential candidates and the far right echo chamber have made politically correct an all purpose dismissal for facts and opinions they don t want to hear take donald trump s claim that when the world trade center towers collapsed on 9 11 i watched in jersey city new jersey where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down thousands of people were cheering the post s fact checker columnist glenn kessler found no evidence to support trump s claim and gave him four pinocchios reserved for the most baldfaced lies politifact gave the statement a pants on fire rating denoting extreme mendacity but when abc s george stephanopoulos pressed the gop front runner to explain himself noting that police say it didn t happen trump resorted to what has become a familiar dodge i know it might not be politically correct for you to talk about it but there were people cheering as that building came down trump said ben carson running second in the national polls is even more fond of the political correctness allegation so much so that it could be considered a central theme of his campaign it is unclear whether he actually knows or cares what political correctness means the phrase is just more verbal romaine to add to the word salad that is carson s discourse he used it when challenged on his stance that a muslim should not be president even though the constitution explicitly states there can be no religious test for public office political correctness is imposed by the secular progressives and those who wish to fundamentally change our society he said therefore they make things off limits to talk about but you know what i m going to talk about it anyway in other words he considers the framers of the constitution a bunch of secular progressives since they re the ones who put a candidate s faith off limits that s not the loopiest thing carson has said his attempts to discuss financial reform are in a class of their own but it s in the top 10 the renowned neurosurgeon took the same route sunday when stephanopoulos who had a busy morning asked him to react to trump s call for the united states to resume harsh interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects including waterboarding i agree that there s no such thing as political correctness when you re fighting an enemy who wants to destroy you and everything that you have anything to do with carson said and i m not one who is real big on telling the enemy what we re going to do and what we re not going to do but carson is a medical doctor who took an oath to heal and alleviate suffering or maybe he believes that hippocrates the father of western medicine was just another pc lemming blindly following the secular progressives who are leading
