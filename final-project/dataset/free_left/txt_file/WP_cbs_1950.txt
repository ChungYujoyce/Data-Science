watch cbsn live by aimee picchi updated on april 16 2020 1 45 pm moneywatch people eager to find out when they would collect their federal stimulus check flocked to the irs s new get my payment serviceafter it launched wednesday but many are expressing confusion and concern after the site told them that the status of their payment wasn t available jason hale 25 of oak park illinois went on the tax agency s website early wednesday to check on the status of his payment after hearing from friends that they had received the funds but instead of getting information on when his money would be deposited a message on the site read payment status not available i thought maybe try it a different way maybe lower case he said of his experience on the website but after a few attempts at entering information the site locked him out suggesting he try again in 24 hours it was very frustrating hale tweeted about his experience and received hundreds of responses with many people saying they d received the same message others contacted cbs moneywatch to express frustration about getting locked out of the get my payment service or being told that the status of their funds wasn t available literally all my friends have received their stimulus checks except me then then i go to the get my payment tab in the irs website and this is what pops up anybody else in the same boat as me ijustwantmystimuluscheck pic twitter com a70zw6edk2 according to a statement from the u s treasury department the payment status not available message means the irs cannot determine your eligibility for a payment at this time for example you didn t file either a 2018 or 2019 tax return or you recently filed and the return has not been fully processed for example taxpayers who recently filed their 2019 returns might not find information regarding their stimulus payment because the irs is still processing their returns the treasury department has said about 80 million taxpayers will receive their stimulus payments by the end of the week but with almost 140 million taxpayers in the u s that means 60 million americans may still be waiting for the payments and are eager for information on when they ll receive them some taxpayers report that they already filed their 2019 returns and are still getting the payment status not available message some like hale have already received their 2019 tax refunds but still can t find out when they ll get their stimulus payments that s left some to speculate why the irs site can t provide tracking information on their stimulus checks but none are certain of what s causing the hold up and getting help from the irs is proving fruitless given that the agency s phone assistance is shut down because of the pandemic i am not sure i have ever been so frustrated by a situation in my entire life said erin feldman todd a single mother in denver who received the same messages as hale on wednesday and isn t sure when she ll receive a stimulus check of 1200 for herself and 500 for her 10 year old son i have tried every irs phone number i can find every single one todd who tried to access the irs get my payment site again on thursday morning without luck said she needs the money to pay for utilities food and her mortgage after her employer slashed her hours to 25 hours a week from 40 she has 109 in her bank account and says she ll be short on her bills this month without the stimulus payment and a refund for her 2019 taxes which she filed a month ago i m one of those people who will advocate for myself and my son to the nth degree and there s nothing i can do she said referring to the lack of information and help from the irs it s literally making me physically ill as for hale although he hasn t lost his job with the democratic party of illinois he said the check would help pay bills and build up his savings in case he loses income or work the irs and treasury created the tracking website and are disbursing the economic impact payments less than three weeks after the 2 trillion stimulus bill was signed into law by president donald trump yet during that time millions of workers have lost their jobs with more than 22 million americans filing for unemployment in about a month one of those is cody brooks 23 of huntsville texas who recently lost his job at a furniture removal company because of the coronavirus pandemic next time i owe the irs i m going to send this screenshot paymentnotavailable stimuluscheck stimuluspayment fraud scam pic twitter com hhwmto2fvv he was able to access the get my payment site
