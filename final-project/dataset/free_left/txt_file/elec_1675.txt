please read our updated privacy notice and terms of use effective on december 19 2019 the bernie sanders campaign was ahead of its time possibly by as little as three months had the democratic primary been held in the year 2040 the socialist s overwhelming support among millennials and zoomers would have made him the presumptive nominee by mid march for the purposes of this hypothetical sanders remains spry at age 98 and human civilization remains a thing in 20 years although the vermont senator ended his 2020 campaign this week boasting a smaller coalition than he d assembled four years prior his resilient hold on a supermajority of voters under 40 combined with that cohort s exceptionally left wing views in policy polling suggests that the moral arc of the democratic party bends toward sandersism that arc may have been much shorter had our present nightmare come a bit sooner the democratic primary was principally contested in a world that bears little resemblance to the one where it ended and by the time joe biden s promise of a return to normalcy had lost all plausibility sanders s political revolution had lost the same the covid 19 pandemic foreclosed america s path back to some facsimile of the obama era but it did so only after super tuesday had all but foreclosed sanders s path to the democratic nomination which makes it hard not to wonder what if the coronavirus crisis had arrived a few months earlier throughout the competitive portion of the primary sanders was tasked with selling economic transformation to a country enjoying record high consumer confidence and half century low unemployment how much more widely might his pitch have resonated in a nation hurtling toward levels of joblessness unseen since the great depression at each democratic debate sanders s rivals shot down his calls for single payer health care with pledges to preserve the employer provided coverage that voters know and love or at least tend to express approval of in gallup surveys how much less effective would these rebuttals have been in a country where millions of workers lose such coverage along with their jobs each week in iowa and new hampshire the senator s exorbitant plans for expanding social insurance and green infrastructure were met with exasperated demands for details on how he intended to offset each cent of new spending in a context where america s currency remains undesirably strong and its borrowing costs historically low even as congressional republicans authorize hundreds of billions of dollars in deficit spending on a biweekly basis might the plea but how are you going to pay for it have packed a bit less punch of course the sanders campaign s faults weren t limited to poor timing and if coronavirus has created more auspicious conditions for the senator s arguments it doesn t necessarily follow that the pandemic has created ones more favorable to his candidacy after all democratic voters saw the trump presidency as a crisis well before covid 19 made its presence felt to the extent that blue america s post 2016 siege mentality drew voters toward the more familiar and conventionally electable of their options the coronavirus may have made biden s ultimate victory more resounding not less regardless debating counterfactuals is only useful for interpreting the world and for supporters of the socialist senator the point has always been to change it what this crisis might have done for the sanders campaign is an interesting question what opportunities it still presents for advancing progressive reform is an important one and there is some reason to believe that the present emergency is at least as promising a vehicle for bottom up social change as sanders s candidacy once was the senator s advocacy for single payer health care over the course of the 2020 race did little to increase public support for that policy in fact medicare for all became 24 percent less popular among democratic voters between march and november of last year in quinnipiac s polling a decline likely attributable to sustained attacks on the program from sanders s primary rivals by contrast between the onset of the covid 19 pandemic and the end of march support for medicare for all jumped by nine points in morning consult s survey sanders s four year crusade to move the boundaries of political possibility on capitol hill yielded few concrete victories while his influence on the national political discourse pulled many democrats leftward his movement s lackluster showing in the 2018 house primaries gave speaker nancy pelosi s moderates little cause for guarding their left flanks the coronavirus by contrast hasn t just shifted policy debates leftward in the democratic house but has also forced the republican senate majority to acquiesce to a historically generous expansion of unemployment benefits the provision of direct cash assistance to all working class families and a grossly inadequate paid sick leave program the vermont senator s evangelism for nordic social democracy may have raised millennials awareness of the u s welfare state s inadequacies but by overwhelming unemployment insurance bureaucracies from coast to coast covid 19 has made the necessity of bigger government apparent even to the likes of florida s republican governor ron desantis most promisingly the pandemic is now broadcasting sanders s most vital message that america s working people deserve more than they ve been given and are collectively more powerful than they realize at a volume too loud for plutocratic propaganda to drown out the coronavirus has forced the u s government to inform grocery store clerks warehouse workers delivery drivers and crop hands that they are among our society s most essential members even as many of their employers have revealed a callous indifference to their personal safety together these developments have fostered a wave of worker militancy with warehouse strikes disrupting amazon deliveries and ge workers walking out in hopes of compelling their bosses to shift production away from jet engines and toward ventilators this is the stuff that change is made of a progressive movement capable of credibly threatening primary challenges would nudge pelosi s caucus leftward a labor movement capable of credibly threatening to shutter amazon s supply chain however could turn joe biden into fdr if democrats manage to win power this november an advanced stage of the covid crisis will almost certainly still be around to greet the new administration come january according to the congressional budget office s latest projections america s unemployment rate will remain above 9 percent at the end of 2021 the damage that coronavirus is doing to the health care industry s finances meanwhile is likely to yield widespread premium hikes and hospital closures next year an america in which the private sector durably fails to provide full employment or affordable health care is one in which the left will find broader sympathy for the green new deal and medicare for all and a well organized progressive movement proficient in the disparate arts of cajoling elites in smoke filled rooms and emboldening workers on picket lines could translate that public support into political revolution he s a well known lover of the truth for loeffler a lot of damage has already been done the justice department notified three senators on tuesday that it will not pursue insider trading charges against them after an investigation into stock transactions from the early days of the coronavirus pandemic did not find sufficient evidence they had broken the law according to a person briefed on the investigations the department contacted lawyers for senators kelly loeffler republican of georgia james inhofe republican of oklahoma and dianne feinstein democrat of california all threehad sold substantial amounts of stockin late january or early february when lawmakers were being briefed on the novel coronavirus threat but before the pandemic began roiling financial markets or was fully understood by the public law enforcement officials appear to still be investigating senator richard m burr republican of north carolina whose own mid february stock sales have drawn scrutiny from the justice department and securities and exchange commission last week f b i agentsseized mr burr s cellphone good news out of new york katie miller the highest profile trump administration member to have contracted coronavirus is doing better a real sign of the times georgia s governor bids for the rnc amid talk that charlotte might not host after all there needs to be something for democrats to panic about and right now this is it in early april jason furman a top economist in the obama administration and now a professor at harvard was speaking via zoom to a large bipartisan group of top officials from both parties the economy had just been shut down unemployment was spiking and some policymakers were predicting an era worse than the great depression the economic carnage seemed likely to doom president donald trump s chances at reelection furman tapped to give the opening presentation looked into his screen of poorly lit boxes of frightened wonks and made a startling claim we are about to see the best economic data we ve seen in the history of this country he said the former cabinet secretaries and federal reserve chairs in the zoom boxes were confused though some of the republicans may have been newly relieved and some of the democrats suddenly concerned everyone looked puzzled and thought i had misspoken furman said in an interview instead of forecasting a prolonged depression level economic catastrophe furman laid out a detailed case for why the months preceding the november election could offer trump the chance to brag truthfully about the most explosive monthly employment numbers and gdp growth ever risk public health or else president donald trump on monday morning threatened to move august s republican national convention out of north carolina unless there are guarantees the state will let everyone attend i love the great state of north carolina so much so that i insisted on having the republican national convention in charlotte at the end of august unfortunately democrat governor roycoopernc is still in shutdown mood unable to guarantee that by august we will be allowed full attendance in the arena he began in a string of four tweets the rncis scheduled to be held in charlotte on aug 24 27 less than a week after democrats are set to wrap up their rescheduled convention in milwaukee it s not clear where the republican convention might be moved or how easily that could be done on relatively short notice and this is only part of why the way too late european travel ban was a complete disaster the europe restrictions followed six weeks later but unleashed chaos in ways that surpassed even that of the muslim ban current and former officials said key agencies including the departments of homeland security and transportation had no meaningful input in the nature of the europe restrictions or how and when they would be executed an administration official said officials from both agencies were present at meetings where the ban was discussed the administration scrambled to round up contractors to conduct temperature checks on tens of thousands of passengers officials said the magnitude of the mobilization was unprecedented even so the contractors were overrun by the rush of travelers that trump had helped unleash even the most basic screening steps seemed to backfire the cdc failed to distribute a new paper questionnaire in time for it to be shared with airlines in advance meaning passengers had to fill it out upon arrival as a result travelers found themselves reaching around one another for slips of paper and pencils risking transmission as the bottlenecks got worse already a
