with new information on thecoronavirus coming in constantly people are struggling to keep up with all the ways it is transforming everyday life cbs this morning assembled a panel of experts cbs news medical contributors dr david agus and dr tara narula and cbs news business analyst jill schlesinger to answer questions from viewers around the country who want to know how the coronavirus affects their health and their finances q can you get tested to see if you may have coronavirus already dr agus that s our dream is to have a test in the blood to see who had the virus and who had an immune response other countries have it it s out in china it s out in some of europe hopefully we will have it in the next week or so and that s critical to know if you can go back because what we think is if you have immune proteins antibodies in the blood that this test will show you cannot get the virus again at least for a short term we don t know long term because the virus has only been around since december q if you have already been diagnosed with coronavirus how do you know when it s safe to re enter society dr agus it is three days after symptoms are totally gone and seven days at least since the beginning of symptoms if you meet those two criteria you can go out q is there any proof that the coronavirus can be caught by pets dr narula a lot of people want to know about pets so there s no evidence to date to suggest that pets can either be a source of infection or that they can contract covid 19 that being said there really is a lack of data and research in this area the cdc says if you are suspected to have covid 19 or you ve tested positive you really do want to maintain distance from your pet the same way you would from humans so you ll want to avoid the kissing snuggling petting that you love to do and if there s someone else in your home that can help take care of your pet you want to ask them to help out if it must be you that does it make sure you wash your hands before and after you interact with your pet q does the 1 200 relief check being sent to individuals include retired seniors schlesinger absolutely it does so even if the only source of income is social security you will get this check as long as you fall below that 75 000 threshold and even if you don t file taxes don t worry the government will access your information through the social security system so seniors you too will be getting checks q when will people see their unemployment benefits schlesinger i m hearing from a lot of people around the states usually states have a one week waiting period they re encouraged to waive that because of these flood of claims we saw over 3 million in a week that is stopping up the system so two to three weeks is what we re hearing from the crowded states where there are tons of claims q are we learning anything from studies that look at the weather and virus effects dr agus not yet it s just too new the virus began in december i mean the hope is that other viruses can go away as the temperature goes up so we don t know with this one we know our behavior changes and as temperatures go up you re outdoors the u v sunlight degrades the virus the virus is not alive will temperature itself get rid of these particles we don t know i hope q is it safe to go to a doctor for nonessential visits like a chiropractor for example dr narula so you want to look at who you are what your vulnerable abilities are but also what is the service or the visit for certainly if it s urgent your doctor the health professional may want to see you if it is non urgent most doctors offices are rescheduling and pushing patient visits out at least 45 days or so this is a great point where telehealth or telemedicine can be useful lots of doctors offices are doing it for non urgent issues q will workers who have been laid off due to the coronavirus receive their full pay through the unemployment department schlesinger no they probably will not so there are two tiers of unemployment one is state of residence that goes 26 weeks and usually covers between 40 to 50 very state specific and then the government program that will tack on 13 weeks to whatever the maximum is in your state and will also provide you with 600 a week for four months through july so you ve got to check with your state probably end up at maybe 70 or 80 of your pay prior to the virus q if i get the 1 200 stimulus check do you have to pay taxes on that schlesinger no you do not that s great news that would be sort of a weird double whammy there s one little issue though because you re basing your check on your adjusted gross income line 8b on your tax return if you have not filed yet for 2019 they re going to look at your 2018 returns the only adjustment that could be made some if your income really changes maybe goes higher in 2019 i don t think that s going to be a problem for most of the people involved here q since this is an illness that attacks the lungs if you had the pneumonia vaccine does that provide protection against the severe symptoms dr agus the answer is no the pneumonia vaccine is against a particular bacteria that can cause pneumonia this virus is totally separate while they both cause pneumonia the vaccine will not affect your response to the virus at all you re still as likely to get pneumonia unfortunately q is it ok to make masks for medical professionals who lack them dr narula well so the surgical masks and the n95sare the ones that are really certified and regulated that s because they re tested for how they fit the materials used how permeable they are what kind of barrier they are that said in a crisis situation which we are in and we re hearing so much from the frontline workers about how they lack personal protective equipment any kind of a barrier even if it s a cloth mask may help prevent those large droplets from entering the nose or the mouth of the health care worker so there are some hospitals in this country that are accepting donations others are not you need to check in the local area where you live but certainly it is inspiring to see how many people have stepped up to try to help q with constant hand washing and dry skin in the winter you can get painful cracks in your skin if you have cracks in your hands are you more susceptible to touching something and having the virus get inside you dr narula well it s not really that the virus would get in through the skin so that s not really a portal of entry but we know that your hands if they touch droplets and then you touch your face you can certainly spread it that way to the nose or the mouth or the eyes so you definitely want to be careful about where you re putting your hands and where you re touching which is why we say keep your hands below the neck if possible i know it s difficult but really try q is it safe to go for a walk in the park outside or are you in danger of catching coronavirus in the air dr agus yeah it s ok to go outside u v sunlight does degrade the virus you need to maintain social distance there s talk of closing streets in new york city to make it easier so they can walk in the street and have the social distance we re going to go stir crazy if we re in a room staring at four walls q is it true that you can pick up the virus on your shoes when you re walking outside dr agus i can t imagine that that being said you can always leave your shoes at the door if you re worried watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand
