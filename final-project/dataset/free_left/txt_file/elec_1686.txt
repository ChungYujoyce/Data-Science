our sincere congratulations to republican vice presidential candidate mike pence who according to the republican party has emerged victorious in the sole vice presidential debate of 2016 despite it not having happened yet the gop appears to have accidentally published a draft of a post congratulating pence on his victory about two hours before the debateactually started it s not uncommon for communications staffers to prepare statements in advance of course it is however unusual to make those congratulations live the consensus was clear well before the dust settled it seems we have to agree that pence s forthcoming top moments of the debate were economy and highlighting hillary s scandals who could forget those moments which we expect to see sometime over the next few hours good memories of those things in the future also congrats to donald trump who earns a little mention in there but you know who did not win was hillary clinton that s for sure the gop had a story ready to go on that too the american people have spoken from the future they say this tonight s biggest loser was clinton we are by now used to the distinction between who actually won the debate and who the losing side says won the debate we also remember that the trump campaign was running ads blaring trump won even before the first presidential debate ended and that the campaign subsequently embraced garbage online surveys as evidence of hisvictory but pre declaring victory is just a smidge further down the line the republican party apparently realizing this retracted both articles meaning that the future is yet to be written we can t wait to see who the gop thinks actually won the debate and what top moments the victor might have experienced update it seems that the gop also took issue with the questions that hadn t yet been asked yo debate moderators you already failed too https t co boaohmw6m9 pic twitter com 9e5b8eastm receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
