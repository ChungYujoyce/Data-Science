as donald trump continues his pundit defying dominance of the national polls with early primaries just days away the once unthinkable has become all too thinkable could trump actually pull this off could he become president i m going to stake out a firm answer no absent extreme and unlikely circumstances trump will never be president jack shafer argues that trump s success so far is a black swan event an unpredictable and unrepeatable concatenation of improbable circumstances that sounds about right but just because some political rules and conventions have been violated doesn t mean they ve all vanished just because trump makes no sense doesn t mean common sense has become worthless one black swan does not foretell a flock of black swans trump might win the gop nomination but as we set off down the long and difficult road of a general election what has been his strength in this election cycle so far will inexorably become his weakness and there s no reason to think he ll be able to pivot to a different approach trump is like wile e coyote sprinted off the cliff hanging in the air he s hung there longer than anyone expected but that doesn t mean he can fly one of the best things i ve read this year about trump s appeal is by josh marshall it harks back to his legendary in some circles 2004 post about bitch slap politics marshall has wisely abandoned that term but the concept behind it has never been more relevant it s about dominance displays about showing rather than arguing that one s opponent is weak it s done not through critique but through attack personal attack demonstrating that the target will not or cannot defend him or herself the attack doesn t make the point it is the point marshall s original application was to theswift boat attacks in 2004 what made those effective was not their substance he says but the optics of john kerry getting beat up and sitting passively by while it happened how could he defend america if he wouldn t defend himself now trump has taken that kind of politics to a new level as i ve said this kind of dominance symbolism is pervasive in gop politics it s not new with trump at all most successful republican politicians speak this language and yet somehow for most it is nonetheless a second language but it s trump s native language wherever it comes from he seems to intuitively get that for this constituency and at this moment just demonstrating that he gets his way always is all that really matters policy details protecting the candidate through careful press releases and structured media opportunities none of that matters though it makes pundits somewhat uncomfortable to admit it most voters especially the politically disengaged working class white voters trump is attracting don t know much about issues and don t have well defined political philosophies when they witness political debate they aren t really analyzing and assessing arguments they are reading the subtext attuned to who s aggressive and who s defensive who s strong and who s weak who seems like a leader and who doesn t trump instinctively gets this his innovation if you can call it that is to abandon the text altogether bringing the subtext to the surface toughness is no longer a side dish it s the main dish the only dish trump will win because trump wins it s a post truth post substance campaign affect from top to bottom that s why the national review style he s a secret liberal attacks simply bounce off him his appeal has nothing to do with consistency on policy or fealty to conservative ideology it is 100 percent about dominance and that s why his gambit on thursday night was so brilliant it replaced a debate which is at least formally about positions and plans with a raw contest of power his weakness with his strength sure enough his absence devastated ratings for the debate he s done this again and again throughout the primary shifting media and public attention to personal power struggles in which policy differences play no role he jam packs the news cycle belittling foes appearance and personalities thumbing his nose at the political establishment and making his lead in the polls the core of his message there s no air for anything else marshall sums it up trump doesn t kiss babies babies kiss him he doesn t have a billionaire backer he is a billionaire trump doesn t ask for support he just tells you that you need to stop being a loser and get on board that approach has proven immensely potent in the gop primary the angry white people flocking to trump feel like they re getting snubbed looked down on and passed over that a new culture is rising up around them and it has no place for them two veterans tell me why they believe in trump he s more of a 19th century president in a 21st century age pic twitter com omzpv6jswm and now here is one of their own okay maybe not struggling like them but definitely pissed off and politically incorrect like them expressing their fears and resentments without apology trump is their avatar and he is making all the fancypants politicos and journalists bend a knee and kiss his ring they can t hurt him and he makes sure they know it he is a florid middle finger to every one of the cultural elites his followers feel disdained by they ve been getting crapped on years now someone is taking their side and doing some of the crapping they love it they don t necessarily love him but they love watching him stick it to the elites and why wouldn t they they are through trump winning again like they used to back in the good old days since 2004 with the debut of trump s reality show the apprentice the us public has only seen the donald in one mode in charge winning dominating he was on top in his show by design he s been on top of the field for the whole primary he s come out on top in every dispute with fox news or the republican party to people unfamiliar with his pre apprentice career in new york trump has always and only been a winner that was not an obvious outcome when he entered the race but he has an instinct for what pleases and excites his audience or what enrages those his audience hates very often the same thing and he quickly discovered that belligerent xenophobia worked as dara lind argues there s good reason to believe that he pursued immigration mainly because that s what hit with his initial crowds so he entered with maximal bluster and has just kept it up posturing bullshitting furiously expressing the most extreme version of everything that pumps up his audience extolling his own dominance and it s working it just keeps working he s wile e coyote suspended in the air floating he seems to my eye as baffled by it as anyone else that s the significance of the i could shoot people comment it s incredible that s not what people say when events are unfolding according to their carefully laid plans he s just as amazed as everyone else by the resilience of his appeal he can t believe it s working either but what happens when he s not on top not dominating presidential campaigns are long and intense with many ups and downs along the way once he is no longer a phenomenon a spectacle but an honest to god candidate in a one on one race trump will not be able to avoid answering questions about policy or substance he will not be able to belittle and marginalize everyone who challenges him or skip every debate that doesn t agree to his terms he will not be able to dictate the terms of the contest as he has so far sooner or later he ll have to navigate situations where he s on the defensive where he s being asked to defend himself or apologize or treat an opponent with respect what then what will arrogant bluster look like in that context also trump s shtick excites a portion of the electorate resentful xenophobic white that is more robust than most political elites realized but the shtick also polarizes trump has higher unfavorables than any of his opponents taken to a national race his current act will even more sharply divide an already polarized country and here s the bedrock obstacle to trump s success there are simply not enough struggling resentful xenophobic white people in the us to constitute a national majority sufficient to win a presidential election so to win trump will have to reach out to moderates or independents or white collar professionals or latinos or college educated women or some other demographic endless dominance displays will not do that he ll have to soften his approach to show some respect and gravitas to display some empathy to demonstrate that he has a grasp of policy bush style compassionate conservatism is the only kind capable of building a national majority anymore can trump do that can he modulate his act can he appeal to different demographics well he never has and nothing in his history or behavior indicates that he s capable of it a few commentators most eloquently philip bump have interpreted trump as wanting to be liked which indicates to them and to some in the republican establishment that trump will be malleable in a way that a more ideological candidate like cruz will not but i don t think that s quite right bill clinton wants to be liked that s why he makes everyone he meets feel like the center of the universe the sole focus of his attention people like that trump doesn t make people feel that way indeed he has constructed his entire professional life around him being the center of universe the focus of any room he s in he doesn t want to be liked he wants to be respected and feared he wants to be the top dog he is obsessed with it i think people often misread that as a species of strength but its true origin is fear deep pre verbal fear down in the brainstem some scientists have looked into what makes conservatives conservative one thing they ve found is that conservatives are more sensitive to negative features of the environment to threat contamination disorder at the far right end of the spectrum is the authoritarian who dreams of total control freedom from all threat peace through strength and that s trump who not coincidentally refuses to shake hands for fear of germs he must be in control have all the leverage in every situation if he doesn t he just declares bankruptcy and moves on he is hyper attuned to disrespect or disloyalty as the feud with fox news this week showed and a hair trigger fight or flight reflex makes him prone to outbursts and personal attacks whenever he feels threatened which is often it s pathological and the thing about pathologies is that they cannot be taken on and off like masks they are pre conscious they order incoming experience trump may pledge a personality change as president but personalities do not change overnight narcissistic personality disorder is not a strategy it s a condition and it is not going to wear well over the long course of a presidential election in a general campaign trump will not be surrounded by supplicants like he s accustomed to he won t be able to skip debates and bully journalists for an entire election he will be put under intense stress and scrutiny forced to improvise answers to difficult questions that he doesn t get to choose and when he s pushed he ll lash out again and again and eventually people will notice that lashing out is all he s capable of he ll face setbacks and people will notice that arrogant bluster sounds a little tinny and desperate coming from someone who s down people will see his personality on display in circumstances not of his choosing for the first time and they ll recoil at the idea of him holding the nuclear codes maybe core republican voters will stay with him no matter what but he ll repel more than enough non core voters to foreclose a winning coalition bottom line the strongman approach is inherently self limiting it flourishes in the bizarro environs of a modern republican primary but there is no evidence at all and much to the contrary that it could be used to assemble a national majority yet it is the only approach in trump s toolbox that is why he will never be president i can think of two scenarios that would fit the bill one trump faces clinton and late in the race something happens to render clinton unelectable two trump faces sanders and bloomberg jumps in splitting the left vote and throwing the election to trump both seem highly unlikely to me the first because clinton is already the most intensely vetted figure in us politics the second because sanders is unlikely to win the primary get our newsletter
