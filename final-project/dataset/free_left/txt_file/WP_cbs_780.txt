at the atlantic council a think tank in washington d c morell and slavin assess the u s foreign policy posture toward iran and the effect of diplomatic efforts made to date slavin offers insight into tehran s calculus as the 2020 presidential elections approach as well as its rapprochement with russia and china she also outlines tehran s likely regional and global objectives in the near term intelligence matters barbara slavin correspondent michael morell producer olivia gazis jamie benson michael morell barbara welcome to intelligence matters it is great to have you on the show and it s great to see you barbara slavin thank you pleasure michael morell there s so much domestic news that s dominating the headlines that i think some very important foreign policy issues are being squeezed out so given that over the last several weeks we ve done episodes on china and north korea just to try to keep up with what s happening on key national security issues which don t go away as you know simply because we re all focused on impeachment so we ve done china and north korea and we thought we needed to do the sa me on iran so thank you for coming on the show to help us do that barbara slavin okay michael morell but before we talk about iran itself i d love to hear how you got interested in the middle east and how you got interested in iran in particular barbara slavin okay well i was a journalist starting in the 1970s and i think one of my early stories as a young reporter for upi i got sent to the united nations on a sunday to ask henry kissinger about the disengagement agreement between israel and syria so that s probably the first time i actually wrote about anything to do with the middle east but i subsequently went to work for the new york times i worked on the weekend review section it was then called michael morell i loved that section by the way barbara slavin yeah we used to do summaries of world news there was a whole column called the world and i was half of the world for six years and for some reason my partner i don t know he was more interested in europe so i got all the middle east summaries to write including when sadat went to jerusalem when the iranian revolution started in 1978 i was the one who was doing a summary almost every week and then the hostage crisis as well so i think that was my first introduction to iran subsequently my husband and i moved to cairo where i was the correspondent for the economist based in cairo but traveling to libya iraq pretty much every place but iran so the four years in cairo was my real education the middle east yeah michael morell yeah so your program at the atlantic council is called the future of iran initiative what is that and what are you trying to do barbara slavin well we sort of changed the name we had a bipartisan taskforce on iran at the atlantic council that i managed that worked very very heavily on the nuclear issue so put out policy recommendations in 2013 some of which were adopted by the obama administration not all of them and then during the negotiations that led to the jcpoa worked very hard on that in january of 2016 we very optimistically thought that we were going to you know turn a page with iran with the implementation of the nuclear deal and that there would be more things that we could do in terms of people to people engagement explaining iran to an american audience of course as we all know trump got elected nine months later and while we still work to the extent possible on people to people engagement trying to explain iranian history and culture to an american audience a lot of what we ve been doing frankly is trying to preserve the bones of this agreement in hopes that we can return to compliance on all sides michael morell so you supported the agreement barbara slavin yes i did you know with open eyes there were a lot of imperfections clearly it didn t do everything that a lot of people hoped it would do but i thought it was a great foundation for more u s iran diplomacy and for me as somebody who s followed iran since the revolution one of the most encouraging aspects of it was that it brought about this direct high level conversation between americans and iranians i thought that was very important michael morell so barbara let s dig into iran maybe the place to start is with a couple of big picture questions the first one is your views on the overall dynamic in the relationship between iran and the united states and i should say that you wrote a book in 2007 it was 2007 i believe barbara slavin uh huh affirm michael morell called bitter friends bosom enemies iran the u s and the twisted path to confrontation what was the theme of that book and would you change anything about the theme if you wrote it today barbara slavin hmm you know it was about this love hate relationship between the united states and iran that has gone on for a long time i mean maybe even before the revolution to some extent i think you always have a difficult relationship when you have a regi onal power and you have a superpower so i don t think it was ever easy even under the shah but clearly since the revolution we ve had no diplomatic relations we had the hostage crisis we have killed each other s personnel in the persian gulf during the 1980s iran has supported groups like hezbollah that have killed americans in beirut and in iraq and the united states has waged an economic war against iran almost since the beginning it s much worse now frankly than it has ever been in many ways and i think the title of the book would still hold what s really depressing though is that we are in some ways in a worse place now than we were when i wrote it because we ve had the experiment of diplomacy with iran leading to the joint comprehensive plan of action the 2015 nuclear deal and then we ve had a president come in and trash it for in my view no good reason michael morell so barbara how do you think they think of us both in kind of a macro picture stepping back over you know several decades and then how do you think they think about us right now barbara slavin you know i think iranians have always had an admiration for the united states because of the freedoms with enjoy because of our economic success because of our openness until relatively recently to immigrants from all over the world including iran we have perhaps a million iranian americans people who ve come before the revolution and since but unfortunately the positions taken by the trump administration have begun to change that while people still admire the united states and on an individual basis like americans are very welcoming to americans they ve been very very upset by u s policy i mean it began with the travel ban trump had barely been in office a week when he decided to make it almost impossible for people from muslim countries to come to the united states and that felt disproportionately on iran which i think had something like 30 000 visitors to the united states before trump people coming to see their families coming to weddings coming to meet new grandchildren michael morell coming to study barbara slavin coming to study 12 000 iranians studied in this country i m sure the number is much lower now so that was the beginning of it and then of course there was this constant undermining of the iran nuclear deal which culminated in the u s withdrawal in 2018 and then in this year the decision to try to prevent iran from exporting any oil so i think people have soured certainly on trump but perhaps to some extent on the united states we re not considered reliable anymore if one administration can break the promises of a previous one then why should anyone trust anything the united states agrees to michael morell so barbara the second kind of big question is in your view what does iran want in the region and beyond barbara slavin you know it s a hard question to answer because obviously different iranians want different things i would say the majority of the population wants to be respected wants to be able to travel and trade freely with neighbors does not want to be seen as any kind of pariah state or a meddler in regional affairs but there are others who see a kind of forward defense is necessary for iran to protect it from its enemies and that means a lot of influence in neighboring countries and countries that have large shia populations so lebanon and iraq syria obviously and to a much lesser extent yemen afghanistan central asia now we should remember that this hegemonic impulse predates the islamic revolution iran was persia it was an empire for centuries michael morell the shah wanted to do this barbara slavin well the shah of course did i mean actually the support for downtrodden shia muslims in lebanon began very heavily under the shah but if you look at the languages that are spoken and the religions in places like tajikistan afghanistan and so on the influence of the old persian empire is still there so those for example the saudis and others who say that iran should you know stay out of arab affairs well iran was an empire iran has never been divorced from its neighbors and of course the arabs invaded iran and brought it islam in the 7th century so these are countries that have been interconnected by religion by trade by personal relationships going back centuries michael morell and you mentioned some of the things that they do in pursuit of this objective right support to terrorism support to insurgents barbara slavin well again we call them terrorists they don t call them terrorists michael morell right right right exactly barbara slavin you know this is our definition we re putting on it just like you know we call it malign behavior and they call it their foreign policy so i mean you know as a former cia person that the essential thing is to be able to see the world through the eyes of your adversaries michael morell right exactly barbara slavin if you re going to be able to influence them michael morell so how do you think tehran looks at the protest movements in iraq and lebanon barbara slavin i think they re looking at it with great trepidation and of course they have their own protest movement as well you know by and large people do not like iran the influence that iran has in those countries hezbollah of course this goes back almost 40 years and hezbollah while it has defended lebanon has also brought upon lebanon the wrath of the israelis and others so very ambivalent feelings i think in lebanon about iran same thing we ve seen in iraq these protests are being led by young people who don t remember very clearly the u s invasion of their country but they re very aware of the fact that iran is very close to a number of paramilitary groups that many of them really act with impunity they re essentially mafia type organizations that extort money from people so this is resented as well michael morell and then you ve already raised it but the third big question are the protests that we see inside iran itself barbara slavin uh huh affirm michael morell right barbara slavin yeah michael morell and these aren t the first ones barbara slavin no michael morell right this happens occasionally how should we think about those how should the listeners think about those protests barbara slavin they re very serious they re so serious that the iranian government shut down the internet for five days in an effort to prevent the videos of the crackdown from coming outside the country and stirring up opinion in an effort to prevent iranians from talking to each other and organizing more protests the government has been tolerated by iranians but has never been really popular i think you know what is it about you know all revolutions die as soon as they succeed a lot of people had buyer s remorse from day one when they saw that they were getting an islamic theocracy that was extremely repressive in place of the shah s repressive regime so i would say the government has never been very popular but what s different now i think is a lot of people have given up hope partly because of the u s sanctions which have been so crippling and partly because of the repressive forces in their own government which they see as being strengthened by u s sanctions it s so unfortunate because really in 2015 you know there was this welling up of optimism that somehow life would be better you know there were lots of europeans americans coming to iran people talking about business deals boeing was going to sell them new airliners well maybe it s maybe a missed blessing that they didn t get those i don t know of course they weren t the 737 max they were other planes i think but you know there was a feeling that finally after 40 years they were going to head into a good patch and now all of that is gone and yes they blame the united states but they probably blame their own government more because you know iran has continued to carry out other policies which are clearly objectionable to the trump administration and many others and so has brought down the wrath of the united states on them in the form of these sanctions michael morell so is there a risk to the regime here in these protests or not barbara slavin you know i don t think there is at this moment because the regime was very well prepared for these we saw that with the internet disruptions we saw that with a move to very very heavy crackdown immediately there were other protests economic protests in late 2017 early 2018 about a half a dozen people died in those in these there have been a number of arrests probably thousands of arrests so i think this was more serious now we have to understand that the catalyst for it was a huge increase in the price of gasoline which was a tremendous shock to people who are already suffering from 40 inflation and high unemployment and this hopelessness as i mentioned a lot of people felt they had nothing left to lose and so they went out on the streets and they burned banks and gas stations and they were very violent which in turn caused the government to be very violent in its response michael morell so barbara the iranians have responded to the trump administration s policy that you outlined earlier with attacks on shipping in the persian gulf a shoot down of a u s military drone and an attack on saudi arabia s most important oil facility abqaiq what do you think the iranians hope to gain from those kind of attacks barbara slavin well i think the iranians showed what they called strategic patience for a year after the u s withdrew and it was only when mike pompeo the secretary of state said that iran could not export one drop of its oil that we saw them shift from patience to resistance they would call it they say that if they can t export oil then others should not be able to as well and i think what they re trying to show and i wrote a piece about this that we can t have our baklava and eat it too if the u s is going to declare economic war on iran then u s allies in the region will bear the brunt iran is smart enough to know that they can t kill americans and get away with it but they tested donald trump they saw that he did not even retaliate for the shoot down of the drone they ve decided that he is a twitter tiger and that they can escalate without risking military action against iran and that s exactly what they ve done their goal is to force the united states to the negotiating table to offer sanctions relief in return for new negotiations and to scare the europeans into providing compensation to iran for the u s withdrawal from the deal when iran was in full compliance with it it s risky but iran you know has iron nerves when it comes to this sort of thing and the fact that the u s withdrew from the jcpoa has strengthened the more hardline elements in the country the islamic revolutionary guard corps entities that are prepared to take these kinds of calculated risks and we ve also seen them escalate on the nuclear front there has been a gradual breach of limits set in the nuclear deal in response to the u s withdrawal michael morell so would you expect barbara that they would continue these kind of attacks barbara slavin i think it s entirely likely you know we had a flurry of diplomatic overtures around the time of the un general assembly the french president emmanuel macron came up with an idea for a 50 billion credit to iran essentially a credit for future oil deliveries after sanctions are lifted in return for new talks on aspects of the nuclear agreement that frankly are lacking and president trump seemed interested in this but he would not announce any kind of sanctions easing prior to a meeting with iran and the iranian president hassan rouhani has made it clear that he s not kim jong un he doesn t give away photo ops for free michael morell yeah and it would be costly to him politically barbara slavin yeah he would gain nothing i mean he didn t even meet with president obama when they reached a landmark agreement so why would he meet with donald trump who has done so much damage to the iranian economy michael morell and how concerned are you i mean maybe you re not given that we re not willing to engage militarily in response how worried are you that these kind of resistance attacks could escalate into a larger military conflict barbara slavin i m very worried because you know i think from an iranian domestic political point of view a confrontation with the united states i mean it s risky but it might solidify public opinion around the government if the united states was seen as being in the wrong and iran is being careful but you know accidents happen and if an american had been at abqaiq at that saudi oil facility and had been killed or an american on one of those tankers that would ve made it difficult more difficult i think for president trump not to respond in some sort of way i mean so far i think the reaction from the u s there s been some cyber meddling probably the u s was somehow involved in trying to encourage the protests in iran i m sure that our intelligence agencies were involved in trying to fan the flames which was probably one of the reasons why the government shut down the internet but you know it s at this gray zone level and my hope is that somehow it stays there at least until our elections because i think the iranians like people around the world are waiting to see who will be the next president of the united states michael morell so what do you think iran s strategy will be between now and november of 2020 barbara slavin i think they will keep the pressure on certainly through nuclear steps they have already started enriching uranium again at fordow which is an underground facility very difficult to attack i would expect more centrifuges to be installed perhaps the level of enriched uranium to creep closer and closer to weapons grade they may begin to play some games with the inspectors the international atomic energy agency right now has 24 7 you know 365 day a year access to iran s declared nuclear facilities perhaps that access will be impeded in some way they will make sure that they stay on the agenda as hard as that is given everything else that s going on in the world and of course everything that s going on in the u s domestically michael morell if president trump wins reelection do you think they ll be forced to come to the negotiating table given how damaging the economic sanctions have been barbara slavin i think there s some in iran who would like to do a deal now because they sense that trump is weak and that he s looking for some sort of big win in terms of foreign policy so you know if the sanctions continue of course the issue with sanctions is that the longer you try to maintain maximum pressure the more they start to fall apart and this is particularly the case with sanctions that are unilateral in nature that are being shoved down the throat of iran s trading partners so i would expect that they will erode further and that more and more countries will find mechanisms to circumvent them by trading in local currencies avoiding the dollar avoiding the u s fin ancial system and we re already seeing this with russia to some extent china and even the europeans have developed a mechanism it s not very robust yet but if trump is reelected and tries to keep the same policy toward iran i would expect to see more trade with iran from all sorts of quarters michael morell and what about a democrat if a democrat wins what do you think iranians would do barbara slavin well i think they re expecting that the u s would return to compliance to the jcpoa i think they also understand that any u s president would probably want new negotiations because a lot of the limits in the deal expire in short order 2024 2025 2030 michael morell so barbara let me ask you kind of a set of seemingly random questions we talked earlier about the street level protests in iran and what those mean what about elite politics in iran how would you describe it is there a struggle among the elites for the future of the country how do you think about that barbara slavin you know iran has always been very fractious it s not a totalitarian state it has politics within set guidelines so it has always had more conservative and more liberal elements within the elite the so called insiders of the regime who are maybe a couple of thousand people basically we re talking about who you know made the revolution and fought the war against iraq in the 1980s and now are in positions of authority in a number of institutions around the country president rouhani and those around him i think saw the nuclear deal as a way to sort of push for a more liberal iran one that was more engaged with the west now i m afraid we re seeing those who think that iran s future lies more with china and russia coming to the fore and these are people who you know want to keep a very tight ship domestically don t want to see more liberalization although i should say that iranian society has changed beyond all recognition since the revolution and it s one of the more secular places in the middle east if you would believe it but they want to keep a lid on it if they can and they want to do their deals with russia china and such countries i think what s happened because of the u s withdrawal because of the protests that we ve seen is that actually there s been a coalescing of the elite behind a rather tough policy this policy of resistance has been confirmed has been supported by almost the entire political spectrum in iran they feel that it is the appropriate response to u s actions and iran is going to have elections parliamentary in 2020 and presidential in 2021 and while unpredictable i mean there could be somebody who could come to the fore who could catch the imagination of iranians probably it will be somebody from the more conservative more hardline camp that will win presidential and will also dominate in terms of the parliamentary elections so i think we re in for a tough period one thing that could affect that of course is our elections if we elect somebody who wants to engage with iran you know that could have an impact on who becomes iran s president in 2021 michael morell so barbara is it fair to say from an iranian domestic political position i m kind of putting together here different pieces of what you said is it fair to say that the nuclear deal gave some weight to the moderates i don t know what you want to call them moderates barbara slavin pragmatists michael morell folks in the barbara slavin pragmatists i call them pragmatists michael morell pragmatists barbara slavin uh huh affirm michael morell who wanted a more liberal iran who wanted an iran that had better relations with its neighbors and that the withdrawal from the nuclear agreement snapped that back and even in a more hard way back to the hard liners is that fair barbara slavin partly i would say that the people who have been set back are people who wanted to put their faith in the west actually one function of the u s withdrawal is that iran has been forced to rely on its immediate neighbors to survive so iraq afghanistan central asia you know iranians would prefer to trade with europe they d prefer to trade with the united states so you know these are fallback positions this is plan b but yeah no definitely as i say i mean there s nothing worse than dashed expectations and during all the time i ve been writing about iran covering iran it was always so controversial the idea of dealing with the united states with the great satan as the hard liners call the u s and then they finally did it and they got this agreement and now it s being destroyed so those who said don t trust the west you can never trust the west particularly the united states you know they re being vindicated and that s a terrible message i think to give a country like this remember 80 million people in the center of southwest asia middle east with oil with natural gas and even more importantly with a very well educated population that was predisposed to like the west that s after all where most of the iranian diaspora is so this is a big set back and it s going to take us a long time to recover michael morell so let me say something and get your reaction to it so i m struck at least it seems to me that the hard liners are generationally challenged that you have the original iranian revolution generation of hard liners you have the iran iraq war generation of hard liners and there s not much after that and so first question is that your sense number one and then number two to what extent are we risking creating another generation of hard liners barbara slavin you know i think that s an excellent question young people you know do still look to the west i mean this is a society that has something like 85 internet penetration almost 70 on social media particularly instagram which is hugely popular you know very focused on western fashion western ideas so i think there is still hope with this generation but if the united states and iran were to go to war if this economic siege were to continue you know that could have an effect and there are young hard liners too you know who use very savvy techniques they have their own movies there s a woman named narges bajoghli at johns hopkins who s written an excellent book about this young generation and their media products so i mean the state supports ten million people these are young activists on college campuses everywhere you look the revolutionary guards all the institutions associated with the supreme leader of the country and religious institutions and no they re not a majority but they re not insignificant so yeah i think there is a danger and that s why the next president has to end the travel ban first and foremost get back into the deal the nuclear deal resume negotiations with iran expand our contacts not constrict them because otherwise i mean we ll have a cuba or a north korea situation which won t be in our interest michael morell well let s assume a democrat wins and the president has to sit down with you and you gave him those points and what if the president asked you how should we handle their activities in the region what should our policy be towards those activities barbara slavin you know we sanction everything now that s the all purpose answer no i think the united states has to engage with other countries in the region these are arab states and you know particularly iraq iraqis would rather have better relations with saudi arabia united arab emirates kuwait other countries where people speak arabic even if many are shia muslim we should encourage the arab countries to get more involved and be more supportive of these countries and compete with iran to the extent we can you know invest to the extent we can engage to the extent we can but we re not going to beat them at their own game they ve been doing this for centuries and sanctions alone and propaganda of the ham handed sort that we re seeing come out of the state department that s not going to do the trick michael morell so barbara let s finish up by having me ask you about iran s relationships with three countries we ve mentioned two of them already so the first is russia how would you describe their relationship with russia barbara slavin well you know russia took away from the persian empire large chunks in the 18th 19th centuries actually invaded iran after world war two and took a chunk of iran at that time the united states helped iran get it back so it is not a relationship of great love but strategically their interests have coincided and together they saved the assad regime in syria and iran is using russia more and more for its banking channels the russians are also under sanction i think we re in danger of creating a coalition of the sanctioned frankly there are dealings that involve repression the old kgb and now the fsb have passed onto iran a lot of its techniques for repressing dissent very brutally so they are getting closer at that level michael morell but how do you think iranians think about growing russian influence in the region barbara slavin i think that they re okay with it now because it generally supports their goals i mean the iranians don t really care about libya for example where the russians apparently are involved now as well but in syria certainly they ve worked together the only caveat would be that of course the israelis deal with russia in syria and get russia s approval for many of the airstrikes that they ve carried out which have killed a lot of iranians and destroyed a lot of infrastructure so you know their interests are not identical but they have coincided and b ecause iran is in the position it s in because of u s sanctions i mean there are not very many big powers they can turn to if it wants to buy weapons not many other places it can go and of course russia has invested heavily in iran s nuclear infrastructure michael morell how about china barbara slavin china has become or had become iran s largest trading partner during the last bout of sanctions which occurred under the obama administration it replaced the european union there are still very strong economic ties again this is not because iran loves chinese products and services it s because it can t get the european products and services that it would rather have so you know the chinese have cut back a fair amount on trade with iran because of sanctions but they have continued to buy oil to some extent they re continuing some of their investments in iran so i think this is an important relationship and this is one that will continue and probably grow michael morell yeah how about turkey barbara slavin turkey is also interesting again there are disagreements you know over syria for example but turkey has been a lifeline for iran a lot of financial transactions go through turkey turkey still buys iranian natural gas and has a waiver i believe to do so because they need it for electricity and you know these are the two great old empires the ottoman empire the persian empire they ve been rivals but there s a stronger and warmer relationship between persians and turks than there is between persians and arabs interestingly enough iranians go to istanbul for vacation or at least they used to when they could afford it so i think that relationship will remain important and we ve seen that erdogan thumbs his nose at the united states frankly and does what he pleases so i m sure he s going to maintain a strong relationship with iran michael morell barbara thank you so much for taking the time to join us today barbara slavin my pleasure thanks for asking end of transcript first published on december 25 2019 6 27 am 2019 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know get the latest
