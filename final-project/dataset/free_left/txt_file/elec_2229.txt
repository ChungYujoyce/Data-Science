 2016 the democrat lets reporters trail her but tucks them away to keep them out of sight and herself out of reach by annie karni 09 03 2016 07 46 am edt trailing hillary clinton since she became the democratic nominee has been less about developing a relationship with the candidate and more like a sensory deprivation experience getty hillary clinton has never felt comfortable with the traveling political press as first lady she would sometimes arrange travel for herself and daughter chelsea separate from her husband partly to avoid the protective pool of reporters assigned to the president in 2008 she fought tooth and nail former aides said to avoid sharing the plane with her press corps and relented only when her campaign was running out of money and had to either bring the reporters on board or downgrade to commercial advertisement and in 2016 with plenty of cash and a winning position in the race clinton has managed to keep the press at arm s length preserving her private plane as a refuge where the only people around are her trusted campaign aides that changes on labor day when the reporters and their press leery candidate will for the first time board a stronger together wrapped 737 and fly from new york to ohio to iowa and remain flying companions for the final stretch of the campaign her team insists clinton is on board with the setup despite her distrust of the national media she does understand that there is very good reason why it s important for everyone to be together in the thick of a general election said her traveling spokesman nick merrill we re going to wrap the plane in blue and get on it together there s a desire to be efficient and be able to do things a little more impromptu but closer quarters are no guarantee of a new level of access the times she ll go back and schmooze will be few and far between predicted one longtime clinton ally she ll send other people back there instead indeed trailing clinton since she became the democratic nominee has been less about developing a relationship with the candidate and more like a sensory deprivation experience when she s speaking at a fundraiser reporters camped outside can sometimes hear a muffled voice but can rarely make out her actual words when she s greeting voters at a coffee shop or on a rope line after a rally the former secretary of state often looks right through the reporters hovering around her like they don t exist and when she does acknowledge their physical presence she smiles through the questions barked at her and encourages reporters to sample a coffee or a chocolate instead by bianca padr ocasio there are full days when the rotating pool of traveling press does not even set eyes on clinton in one instance last month clinton slipped out to martha s vineyard from new york ditching the pool of reporters assigned to cover her altogether certainly the past month has been somewhat out of the ordinary for the campaign clinton has been on a cash dash spending the bulk of the end of summer at private closed press fundraisers rather than public events twice she popped up to call in to cable television programs but there has hardly been a halcyon period of accessibility since she launched her campaign 18 months ago as she enters the final stage of the race sparking new hopes of accessibility onboard hill force one here is a sampling from life on the road with clinton culled from the print pool reports for the past 20 days drowned out by a jet engine aug 31 clinton s plane landed in cincinnati from east hampton new york ahead of

man who described himself as the caretaker of the house where we waited he asked when we were leaving to go into the fundraiser and see her we told him no we aren t allowed to do that he seemed incredulous pool reported no sighting of clinton the entire day intel briefing aug 27 clinton attended her intelligence briefing in white plains while the pool loitered in a parking lot outside pool
