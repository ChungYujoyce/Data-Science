advertisement supported by by jason horowitz washington one recent afternoon senator bernie sanders of vermont gave another of the populist speeches that have drawn the largest crowds of the 2016 campaign to his rallies around the country and have made him the unexpected rival to hillary rodham clinton for the democratic presidential nomination the role of super pacs is corrupt and amounts to legalized bribery he bellowed waving his arms he quoted abraham lincoln and shared his own vision for the future of this country on the campaign trail the speech would have elicited wild enthusiasm from his liberal supporters but this was the senate which was virtually empty except for senator dianne feinstein democrat of california who was busy editing her own speech and senator mike lee republican of utah who was texting you come here it s like o k not much response mr sanders said with some resignation in his senate office earlier this month these days mr sanders a professed socialist does not feel rejected by his colleagues so much as baffled by a clubby institution that does not seem to understand the deep resentment about economic inequality that his campaign has tapped when i m outside of here he said the ideas and the points that we are making are reverberating very strongly with the american people for all his newfound attention mr sanders is still regarded by his senate colleagues as a peripheral figure whose surging presidential campaign is more of an endearing curio than a cause for reassessment senators are kind of surprised at the phenomenon said vermont s senior senator patrick j leahy who like many other democrats is backing mrs clinton but nobody is trash talking bernie that is because many senators respect mr sanders s consistency and fealty to his principles his policy fluency and his ability to work with republicans when he was chairman of the committee on veterans affairs to pass legislation that overhauled the veterans health care system others however consider such legislation a notable exception for a compromise allergic ideologue who has over time managed to infuriate some moderate democratic lawmakers resentful of his self assigned role as the senate s liberal conscience mr sanders is also not much of a favorite of capitol hill reporters who have grown used to his grumbling expressions of displeasure at the political nature of their questions asked about a gleaming excalibur hanging on a wall in his office mr sanders made it clear he knows his reputation that is from ross perot mr sanders said he said when media gives you a problem take it out threaten them it was actually a gift for his work on the veterans bill mr sanders s disdain for the things he views as unimportant is matched by his single minded focus on the things he says are of real consequence like the future of social security at the democratic caucus lunches at which he is a fixture all he ever talks about is social security one congressional aide said he doesn t even try to relate it to the topic at hand that focus was on display a few weeks ago when on an especially slow day in the senate with only a minor vote on the schedule caucus members piled onto buses for a white house meeting with president obama looking around the room mr obama was surprised to see mr sanders bernie he said shouldn t you be out in new hampshire there was a chuckle and then the president asked mr sanders what was on his mind social security mr sanders said while mr sanders takes pride in his record of providing for his home state mr leahy made it clear that when it comes to bringing money back home to vermont i m usually the one who does that mr sanders is more interested in the larger macroeconomic issues said eric l davis a political science professor at middlebury college in vermont asked about his legislative accomplishments over a congressional career that includes 14 years in the house and eight in the senate mr sanders cited some amendments that passed the house and several more recent highlights one was getting billions of dollars of investment in energy efficient technologies as part of the stimulus bill another was inserting 11 billion for community health centers in the affordable care act and tripling funding for the national health service corps which forgives debts for medical students who commit to working in underserved fields and communities donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention he acknowledged that he has gotten little attention for what he has done this is the problem he said i work in areas that nobody knows what i m doing the way he sees it his career has not been that of a gadfly on the margins of congress but rather that of a moral force pulling the mainstream toward his positions stay with me on this one because this is important mr sanders said as he sat in an armchair under excalibur passing legislation is real he said but so is influencing opinion over the long term by speaking out early and often i am a voice he said everybody talks about income inequality well check it out find out who was talking about it 20 years ago with the aid of a yellow legal pad on his lap he went through a litany of instances in which his opposition to an issue now positions him in the democratic mainstream he voted against the defense of marriage act president clinton signed it everyone was for it the deregulation of wall street check the record do it go to youtube look up bernie sanders alan greenspan the war in iraq the patriot act and welfare reform on all the issues he suggested he has moved the party but mr sanders has been more of an outlier than a leader throughout his congressional career when he was a congressman elected as an independent and house democrats decided to allow him to caucus with them to increase their depleted numbers representative bill richardson of new mexico called him a homeless waif and representative barney frank of massachusetts bemoaned his holier than thou attitude since his election to the senate in 2006 mr sanders has become more reliable in his alignment with the democrats though he was a determined and effective opponent to mr obama s effort to reach a grand bargain on the budget in 2011 because of the possibility of cutting social security tom coburn the former republican senator from oklahoma who was also a part of those budget negotiations as a member of the bipartisan gang of six said that mr sanders had a my way or the highway approach to legislating he recalled the time he held up one of mr sanders s bills in the senate he said if you re going to hold my bill i m not going to negotiate with you and i said that s fine i m holding your bill then if you want to adjust your bill and meet some of our concerns then i ll be happy to work with you mr coburn said but he never once did want to do that when senator mark warner of virginia a moderate democratic member of the gang of six working for the budget deal was asked if mr sanders understood the give and take of legislating he smiled and said you always know where he stands before disappearing into an elevator democrats often left their weekly caucus lunch fuming over mr sanders s latest immovable stance i know there are other people who are kind of resentful of that who sit down with republicans and make a whole lot of concessions before the debate begins mr sanders said that s not my style mr sanders is now the ranking member on the senate budget committee and as such would generally be expected to lead the tense and consequential budget negotiations this fall but according to congressional aides familiar with the senate democratic leadership s thinking they have no intention of letting someone so averse to compromise lead the talks mr sanders disagrees he pointed to the compromise he struck on the veterans bill in june 2014 with senator john mccain republican of arizona mr mccain compared the negotiations to an invective strewn world wrestling federation match but added i didn t resent that at all i respected it as a matter of fact because he had strongly held views a year later as a presidential candidate mr sanders has shown an ability to use the senate as another platform for his campaign on june 14 as senators gushed over mrs clinton when she addressed the democrats caucus lunch in the capitol he slipped out early to take advantage of the television cameras outside and he regularly introduces legislation and gives emphatic floor speeches echoing his campaign message he was very enthusiastic for someone speaking to an empty room janet crnich 44 of wisconsin said approvingly after watching mr sanders rail against the influence of money in politics from the senate s viewing gallery last week asked in his office a space decorated with books wage theft in america framed roll calls and pictures of him and president bill clinton if he was a better politician than colleagues gave him credit for mr sanders put his finger to his lips shh he said with a smile don t give it away you are going to ruin it for me advertisement
