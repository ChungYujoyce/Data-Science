advertisement supported by by amy chozick in an election year defined by angry populism hillary clinton made an optimistic economic pitch on friday presenting a wide ranging plan for job growth that would provide incentives for corporations that invest in employees and strip tax benefits from companies that move jobs overseas speaking at an auto parts manufacturer in detroit days before michigan holds its democratic primary mrs clinton proposed a new bargain for the new economy that would bring back manufacturing jobs and increase collective bargaining rights she unveiled her economic proposal as two other presidential candidates senator bernie sanders and donald j trump descended on the state as the campaign entered a new phase moving to the industrial heartland of the country where both men are hoping their anti free trade message resonates a new clawback proposal she unveiled would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas this is the latest revision to the corporate tax code mrs clinton has proposed in an effort to create jobs and lift wages which have been virtually stagnant for 15 years even as the costs of college child care housing and health care have soared she also reiterated her plan to provide tax incentives for companies that share profits with employees and her proposal to raise the federal minimum wage her plan would also place an exit tax on companies that move their headquarters overseas to pay a lower tax rate abroad known as inversions creating good paying jobs and raising incomes is the defining economic challenge of our time mrs clinton said after touring the state s largest business owned by women detroit manufacturing systems which makes plastic assemblies for doors and dashboards michigan proves every day that american workers are the best in the world she said companies have to start treating workers like assets to be investing in not costs to be cut addressing an audience of labor leaders local elected officials and autoworkers mrs clinton singled out companies that she said had received tax benefits as they shipped jobs out of the country they have no problem taking taxpayer dollars with one hand and giving out pink slips with the other she said but unlike mr sanders her democratic rival or mr trump mrs clinton did not espouse a red hot indictment of the private sector or offer a dire assessment of the state s future she provided a stark contrast with their messaging which came on a day in which the government said job growth accelerated in february while wages had stagnated i m not interested in condemning whole categories of businesses or the entire private sector she said but i do want to send a clear message to every boardroom and every executive suite that if you desert america you ll pay a price the speech was a turning point in the democratic contest as mrs clinton who largely relied on the support of minority voters to push her to victories across the south on super tuesday looks to the white working class voters in places like michigan who will vote on tuesday those voters propelled bill clinton to the presidency in 1992 and gave mrs clinton a boost in her 2008 campaign but have since abandoned the party in droves drawn most recently to mr trump s candidacy holding a solid lead in the race for the 2 383 delegates needed to capture the democratic nomination and facing another debate on sunday mrs clinton appeared less inclined to adopt mr sanders s anti wall street message this week the nonpartisan tax policy center released analyses of both democrats plans to raise taxes especially on the wealthy and some businesses to pay for their respective spending initiatives mrs clinton s plans would raise 1 1 trillion in the first decade to mr sanders s 15 3 trillion mainly to pay for his proposal for government run universal health care making her tax proposals incremental by comparison said leonard e burman the director of the tax policy center according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president her experience in government and in politics for a long time tells her that those are the kinds of things that she might get done mr burman said bernie sanders clearly wants to just change things radically it is unclear how effective her clawback proposal would be and whether in the balance of a corporation s business decisions the loss of tax breaks or threat of penalties would tip the scale against moving operations out of the country the proposal would face an uphill battle in a congress that will most likely have at least one chamber the house still under republican control after 2016 mrs clinton repeatedly alluded to the economic successes of the clinton administration when median family income adjusted for inflation increased to 56 080 in 1999 from 48 884 in 1993 compared with a decline to 51 017 in 2012 from 55 987 in 2000 according to census data in the 1990s we made incomes rise for everyone she said and without mentioning mr trump by name she rebuffed his negative assessment of america s prospects i ll tell you when i hear people running for president who spend all their time bad mouthing america it really upsets me she said she named several successful local businesses like shinola a luxury watchmaker and ventower industries which makes the towers used in wind turbines as evidence that businesses have played an important part in the economic recovery mrs clinton s optimistic assessment of the economic recovery under president obama stood in stark contrast to the perspectives of her opponents on both sides before mrs clinton took the lectern mr trump greeted a crowd in warren to raucous chants of build the wall and delivered a fiery message about taking on china and other nations that devalue their currency to hurt american workers this is car country rapidly not becoming car country but we re going to keep it car country mr trump said if you get laid off on tuesday i still want your vote he said i ll get you a new job don t worry about it mrs clinton s address was her most exhaustive yet focused on job creation and leaned on an economic philosophy called inclusive capitalism that many of the clintons s closest advisers adhere to it calls on corporations to invest in employees communities and the environment rather than relying on short term profits that increase shareholder value mrs clinton criticized companies that are overly dependent on dividends and stock buybacks to reward shareholders that s money they re not using to train their workers or give them a raise she said the approach speaks to mrs clinton s belief that the private sector must be part of the solution said gene b sperling an economic adviser in the clinton and obama administrations she is quite comfortable offering more tax relief to companies investing long term in american workers and jobs he said and just as comfortable telling them they are going to face a much tougher tax code when they break their side of the bargain through inversions or short term cut and run strategies if the economic approach of the bill clinton years may evoke fond memories for some voters the policies he and his advisers advanced have also come back to haunt mrs clinton s campaign on friday mr sanders hoping his populist economic message can help him regain his footing in the democratic race with a victory in michigan held two rallies in the state he criticized mrs clinton over the north american free trade agreement which mr clinton signed in 1993 and has become a symbol of voters frustration with free trade if the people of michigan want to make a decision about which candidate stood with workers against corporate america and against these disastrous trade agreements that candidate is bernie sanders he told about 2 000 supporters in traverse city
