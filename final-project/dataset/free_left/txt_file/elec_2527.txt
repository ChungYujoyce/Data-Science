whether you love him or hate him no one can rightly deny that ronald reagan was a transformative president as president obamaput it before he was elected i think ronald reagan changed the trajectory of america in a way that you know richard nixon did not and in a way that bill clinton did not theelection of reagan signaled an end to the new deal era which had endured for nearly half a century after the 1980s american politicsshifted steadilyto the right of the political spectrum with bill clinton accelerating the reagan revolutionwith his bi partisan neoliberal reforms this is why reagan remains such a beloved figure for those on the right even though he would be considered a rino today he is worshipped by republicans while loathed by progressives and yet mostprogressives would probablychoose reagan over any current gop presidential candidate after serving almost as many years as reagan presidentobama recentlycompared himself to the 40th president more or less saying that he was the democrat sreagan while the next democratic president i e hillary clinton by that logic would be bush 41 unfortunately for progressives however obama cannot really be considered the democrat s reagan hehas been much less transformative than supporters once expected him to be andhe has notfundamentally altered america s trajectory as reaganundoubtedlydid sadly this is partially due tohim being a black man which many white americans simply weren t ready for but more to do with his politics as i discuss below the most significant difference between reagan and obama is that the former was an idealist while the latter is a pragmatist or as felix salmon put it in arecent article reagan was a hedgehog and obama is a fox these labels were first popularized by the great philosopher isaiah berlin in his essay the hedgehog and the fox which divided historical writers and thinkers and human beings in general into the two categories based on a line from the greek poet archilochus saying the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing berlin wrote there exists a great chasm between those on one side who relate everything to a single central vision one system less or more coherent or articulate in terms of which they understand think and feel a single universal organizing principle in terms of which alone all that they are and say has significance and on the other side those who pursue many ends often unrelated and even contradictory connected if at all only in some de facto way for some psychological or physiological cause related to no moral or aesthetic principle reagan had a central vision and a rigid political philosophy and was largely unconcerned with details indeed as william leuchtenburg puts it in his new book the american president no one had ever entered the white house so grossly ill informed the 40th president was the antithesis of a policy wonk and often could not answer reporters basic questions about national security and other subjects of importance for many he was just plain dumb indeed a decade before he entered the highest office in the land president richard nixon and his then national security advisor henry kissinger discussed reagan thengovernor of california on the phone saying that he was shallow and of limited mental capacity but the real jewel comes in their contemplating a possible reagan presidency can you think though henry can you think though that reagan with certain forces running in the direction could be sitting right here asked the president to which kissinger simply replied inconceivable what reagan lacked in brain power he made up with in grandfatherly charm and ideological persistence reagan put forth a vision that the government was not the solution but the problem in need of a solution he railed against the new deal era which had come about with the lastgenuinelytransformative president before him franklin roosevelt prior to fdr the government had little place in making sure people were employed and treated and paid fairly as workers as well as ensuring an economy and political system that was not entirely tilted in favor of the capitalist class this new deal philosophy which favored unions and economic regulation came to an end under reagan as i havepreviously written the most notable republican president during the new deal era dwight eisenhower wouldn t dare go after new deal policies which were tremendously popular the former b movie actor took a stand against unions slashed taxes on the wealthy deregulated the financial sector and so on it was a pro capital counterrevolution that ushered in what we now call the neoliberal era after reagan the party of fdr shifted its philosophy tothe right of richard nixon s bill clinton s declaration that the era of big government is over was astark contrastto nixon s earlier claimthat we re allkeynesiansnow while president obama is certainly historic in being the first african american president he has not ushered in any kind of paradigm shift as roosevelt and reagan did before him sadly we are still living in a broadlyneoliberal pro capital country and world and obama has governed only slightly to the left of bill clinton and while hillary clinton has attempted to promote herself as a pragmatic populist one would have to be awfully uninformed to expect any kind of political transformation with her at the helm clinton is more of a poll driven political realist than obama without much of a discernible ideology using berlin s terminology she is the epitome of a fox and would almost certainly govern to the right of our current president so it is that sen bernie sanders i vt whois a hedgehog like reagan is the only current presidential candidatewho could potentially bring reagan style transformation if elected like reagan sanders has a central vision with policy ideas that wouldn t stand a chance of passing in our current congress his goal is to bring forth a political revolution just as reagan did when reagan ran for president he captured the vote of many former democrats namely reagan democrats today sanders wants to recapture their vote and like reagan the idea of sanders becoming president was inconceivable to the establishment not too long ago for many it still is the similarities don t stop there reagan was one of the most personally liked presidents in recent history and sanders has the best favorability and trustworthy ratings of all the current presidential candidates democrat orrepublican he has a stubbornpassion that reagan once brought to the white house though on the opposite side of the political spectrum of course the fact that sanders would overtake reagan as the oldest president elect in history is purely coincidental it should be recalled that unlike fdr s presidency the reagan was largely a failure when it came to enacting actual policy after slashing taxes in his first year he would go on to raise taxes seven times later on in order to make up for lost revenue although he refused to call them tax hikes instead saying revenue enhancements he promised to cut social spending and dismantle government agencies yet ended up adding one of the biggest agency s the department of veterans affairs he also ran against abortion and advocated a constitutional amendment ending it but never seriously attempted this once in office the most successful aspect of reagan s presidency had lessto do with policy and more to do with shifting the debate and convincing american s that the government was the problem he forced democrat s to abandon the new deal philosophy and bill clinton led the way in reforming his party the presidency is not merely an administrative office said fdr in1932 during his first presidential campaign that is the least of it it is pre eminently a place of moral leadership all of our great presidents were leaders of thought at times when certain historic ideas in the life of the nation had to be clarified seven years ago many believed that obama would be the latest transformative president to lead america through aconversion of thought as george packerwroteinthe new yorker the new era that is about to begin under president obama will be more about public good than about private goods the meal will be smaller and have less interesting flavors but it will be shared more fairly the great american improvisation called democracy still bends along the curve of history it has not yet finished astounding the world today economic inequality has grown worse political spending has skyrocketed big banks are bigger than ever and obama is fighting hard forthe trans pacificpartnership which some have called nafta on steroids so much for that transformative change one could argue that if sanders was elected president he would inevitablydisappoint just like obama but he is afundamentallydifferentkind ofpolitician he is personally more like reagan than obama and the differences don t end with personality perhapsone of the biggestdifferencebetween obama 2008 and sanders 2016 is that obama s largest contributor was goldman sachs while the averagedonation to the sanders campaign is about 27 sanders believesin moral leadership which starts with refusing to play bythe current set of rules where special interests hold politicians hostage if that is not a sign of a transformative
