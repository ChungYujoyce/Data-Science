for former vice president joe biden in south carolina as the candidates head to super tuesday can he stop vermont senator bernie sanders joe biden we are very much alive margaret brennan former vice president joe biden won south carolina and won it big joe biden you launched bill clinton barack obama to the presidency now you launched our campaign on the path to defeating donald trump this campaign has taken off margaret brennan with fourteen states up for grabs in just two days biden s victory gives a boost to establishment democrats hoping to deny bernie sanders the nomination senator bernie sanders there are a lot of states in this country nobody wins them all margaret brennan we ll talk with vermont senator bernie sanders about the race plus as the coronavirus crisis prompts questions of whether or not the u s is ready to handle a pandemic the politics of preparedness becomes a big issue president donald trump i don t think it s inevitable it probably will it possibly will margaret brennan now the trump administration faces a crisis of its own calming and reassuring the american public president donald trump we are preparing for the worst we are ready we are ready this is no reason to panic margaret brennan but it s been a rough week of mixed messages and attacks on familiar targets mick mulvaney the press was was was was was was covering their their hoax of the day because they thought it would bring down the president president donald trump now the democrats are politicizing the coronavirus this is their new hoax margaret brennan health and human services secretary alex azar and former fda commissioner scott gottlieb will both be here then the trump administration signs a peace deal with the taliban to end the war in afghanistan secretary of state mike pompeo is just back from that signing ceremony with the taliban and we will talk to him all that and more is just ahead on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation it was a knockout win for former vice president joe biden last night in the south carolina primary he got nearly half the vote coming in close to thirty points ahead over his closest competitor senator bernie sanders cbs news elections and surveys director anthony salvanto is here to tell us more so anthony how did joe biden do this anthony salvanto good morning margaret big keys for him first of all overwhelming support from black voters that was key and they make up most of the electorate in south carolina that was really helped by an endorsement from representative jim clyburn the most influential african american politician in the state more saying that was important than not and then finally big support among those looking for electability that somebody they feel can go on to beat donald trump in november the question now margaret is can joe biden parlay that argument into super tuesday margaret brennan and we ll get details and forecasts from you on super tuesday ahead anthony we turn now to senator bernie sanders he is on the campaign trail in norfolk virginia good morning to you senator senator bernie sanders i vermont berniesanders democratic presidential candidate good morning margaret margaret brennan is this now a two man race senator bernie sanders well all i can say is we have won the popular vote in iowa we won the new hampshire primary we won the nevada caucus we lost last night we re looking forward to super tuesday i think we got a great chance to win in california in texas in massachusetts and a number of states around the country margaret brennan south carolina is the first southern state does that indicate anything to you about your prospects in places like virginia and and north carolina will joe biden really challenge you there senator bernie sanders well we re going to see i mean i think based on the polling we re doing pretty well in virginia i think we got a shot in north carolina all i can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right raising the minimum wage to a living wage dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change those are ideas margaret that i think are resonating all across this country i think we have an excellent chance to do well on tuesday and to win the democratic nomination margaret brennan joe biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning we know from your campaign that you raised forty six million dollars in february that s a significant number what do you think that does for you going into super tuesday what edge senator bernie sanders well margaret it is not only it is not only the amount of money that we raised and that is a phenomenal amount it s how we raised it we don t have a super pac like joe biden i don t go to rich people s homes like joe biden i think joe has contributions from more than forty billionaires what we have done is receive more campaign contributions from more americans than any candidate in the history of the united states averaging eighteen dollars and fifty cents this is a campaign of working people and by working people and i m extraordinarily proud of that but we have enough money now not only to take us through super tuesday but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working class people all across this country margaret brennan your campaign said that if you are the nominee you won t accept the financial help that michael bloomberg has offered he said he d extend it to any party nominee do you really want to turn down his bankroll senator bernie sanders well look mister bloomberg is free to do anything he can with his sixty billion dollars and that s legal all i can say is at this point we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working class and middle class people that we don t have to be beholden to any powerful special interests look one of the things that upsets people margaret brennan so you would accept it senator bernie sanders whether conservative or progressive is i didn t say that what i would say margaret brennan right senator bernie sanders is that he has the right to do anything he wants right now we are confident margaret based on the fundraising that we are doing is that we can beat trump margaret brennan but you are a democratic socialist you have never officially entered the democratic party in fact you constantly criticize democratic establishment so how can you convince the country that you are the best candidate to unify democrats and challenge president trump senator bernie sanders well two points i am a member of the democratic leadership i have been in the democratic caucus from my you know virtually my first day back in congress thirty years ago and from in the state of vermont where i live i am supported by democrats that have won the democratic primary but we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents to democrats and to more than a few republicans look we are living at a time when the american people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in america all over this country margaret and i have been all over this country you got millions of people who work eleven twelve bucks an hour they can t afford childcare margaret brennan mm hm senator bernie sanders they can t afford health care they are scared to death about their retirement they want a government that represents them not just billionaire campaign contributors that s how you win you put together that coalition multi generational multi racial that is what we re doing no campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do that s how you beat trump and by the way almost all of the national polls out there you know i ve had last seventy polls sixty five of them i think have us beating trump margaret brennan yeah senator bernie sanders we re beating them in battleground states like pennsylvania wisconsin and michigan we can beat trump margaret brennan you have rallies planned out in california there is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the west coast is it safe for you have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health senator bernie sanders well actually we have i mean that s a very fair question and my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue and right now we are planning to do rallies not only in california but in utah minnesota and other states around the country margaret brennan you ve been sparring with the pro israel lobby known as aipac you said it gives a platform for bigotry which was seen as a swipe at prime minister netanyahu today israel s ambassador to the u n says of you that you re not welcome in that country and anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar an ignorant fool or both do you see a political cost in taking on the pro israel lobby in this way senator bernie sanders yeah i do i mean they have a lot of money they have a lot of power look i m jewish and i m very proud of my jewish heritage as a kid i spent time in israel i am not in anti israel i will do everything i can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the israeli people but what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects israel but deals with the suffering of the palestinian people as well you got seventy percent youth unemployment in gaza people can t even leave that district that area major major crises it is not sustainable that we continued conflict in the middle east until the united states develops an even handed policy margaret brennan yeah senator bernie sanders so i am pro israel i am pro palestinian i want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region margaret brennan i want to ask you on foreign policy the president just authorized a deal with the taliban what do you think of that because if you re commander in chief you d either follow through with it or halt the withdrawal of u s troops senator bernie sanders well i don t have enough details and the and that peace agreement needless to say is going to have to go through the afghan government we don t know what s going to happen one of the difficulties to be very honest margaret in dealing with trump it is very hard to believe anything that he says whether it s the coronavirus whether what s going on in afghanistan but it is my view that the united states and i i speak of somebody help lead the opposition to getting us into the war in iraq it is my view that we got to end endless wars that when we have five hundred thousand people in america sleeping out on the street and people can t afford health care margaret brennan mm hm senator bernie sanders we got to invest in this country not in endless wars margaret brennan all right senator sanders thank you for joining us former new york mayor michael bloomberg has not yet appeared on a ballot but that will change tuesday he sat down with our scott pelley yesterday in an interview for tonight s 60 minutes here s a preview begin vt scott pelley 60 minutes how do you view this emergency michael bloomberg 60 minutes i find it incomprehensible that the president would do something as inane as calling it a hoax which he did last night in south carolina scott pelley he he said the the democrats making so much of it is a democratic hoax not that the virus was a hoax michael bloomberg this is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem they all around the world say that it is in some places and has enormous potential to become one elsewhere and it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say we don t know but we have to prepare for the fact that if it is we have the medicines and the structure and the knowledge to deal with it end vt margaret brennan scott s interview with mayor bloomberg will air tonight on 60 minutes face the nation will be back in one minute stay with us announcements margaret brennan we want to take a closer look at the growing fears over covid 19 commonly referred to as the coronavirus last week the world health organization said the global risk of the virus spreading is now very high here in the u s there are now seventy one cases of coronavirus and worldwide the death toll is almost three thousand there are also concerns about the global economy here in the u s the stock market took its biggest hit last week since the 2008 financial crisis we begin today with health and human services secretary alex azar good to have you here alex azar secretary of health and human services secazar glad to be here thank you for having me margaret brennan so we just had the first american death on u s soil out in washington state what do we know about how the virus was contracted and how much it has spread alex azar so this individual and we just want to express our sympathy certainly for his family and for all who are suffering from the coronavirus this individual was in the hospital out in calif out out in washington we do not know how he contracted the virus yet and so that s why we and the state of washington are deployed out there to try to trace who he had contact with and how he might have gotten the virus that s why we call it right now a potential community case meaning we don t have a discernible connection to any travel to korea or china or any other impacted area margaret brennan so at this point you don t know if this person came into contact with anyone he just showed up sick at the hospital alex azar we have no evidence so far that establishes a connection to somebody who traveled to an impacted area and so we do not know how he contracted the virus that s really what we do that s the basic blocking and tackling right now of public health is we re going to trace the people that he had contact with we re going to trace the other cases there is a nursing home that sends patients to this hospital and there are cases in that nursing home but who spread to whom we do not know yet margaret brennan the president yesterday when he was speaking referred to this fatality as a woman it is a man alex azar it yes margaret brennan how is a mistake like that made because people are very nervous right now and getting some of these basic facts right affects public trust alex azar well i understand that it s a very fast moving situation our centers for disease control and prevention were up late at night very earl early in the morning working with the washington state public health office and inaccurately recorded that the individual was a female that s what the president was briefed on they ve apologized for incorrectly briefing on that but it s a very fast moving situation obviously we regret the error margaret brennan given that it is so fast moving what are your projections now how many americans do you expect to come down with this virus alex azar so what your viewers need to know is the risk to average americans remains low we are working to keep it low we will see more transmission of cases in the united states we ve got the finest public health system in the world here this is what we do we cannot make predictions as to how many cases we ll have but we will have more and we will have more community cases it s simply just a matter of math margaret brennan well you have to have a number you re working with in order to make sure that you have adequate supply things like testing kits right so alex azar we we don t margaret brennan how are we on shortages you may not want to tell me the number but you have one in your head alex azar no we don t margaret brennan you re using for planning alex azar no we don t we we don t we do not use because it is an unknown the epidemiological spread of this virus in a highly developed health care system that was on it with at the most aggressive containment measures in the history of the united states it is unknown how that will spread in terms of testing kits we ve already tested over thirty six hundred people for the virus we now have seventy the capability in out in the field to test seventy five thousand people and within the next week or two we ll have a radical expansion even beyond that of the testing that s available margaret brennan in washington state in places that have declared emergencies even shutting down schools i mean they are projecting numbers themselves alex azar they might make projections of numbers themselves but we are not we ll take aggressive public health measures it s what we call community mitigation steps so depending on the nature of the disease and depending on what we learn from these in the field investigations margaret brennan mm hm alex azar the state and local government will take measures appropriate to contain the spread of the disease margaret brennan so in france they shut down the louvre museum they re telling people don t kiss don t shake hands in japan they re closing schools for a month canada s health minister told his people to start stockpiling food in the u s there are closures as we just said in washington and in oregon they ve declared a state of emergency out there and the cdc said this week disruption to everyday life might be severe alex azar might might that s margaret brennan what does that mean i mean americans hear this and they are concerned there s about a two percent fatality rate alex azar and i i appreciate that people are concerned of that and that that is why we re being radically transparent about what we know and also what the full range of potential scenarios could be and that s why we say might be but also might not be with aggressive containment and mitigation steps right now it s important for people to understand we re not advising any types of particular measures in the united states like travel restrictions or closures state or local public health offices which are the frontlines of response might make their own decisions to do that but at this point we do not have sufficient spread in the united states that would indicate those measures but we re not taking any of them off the table the full range of options will always remain on the table margaret brennan in a crisis you need public trust alex azar mm hm margaret brennan an inspector general announced this week that they are looking into this complaint by a whistleblower that your agency did not provide adequate training or equipment to those workers who went to receive and welcome back americans who had been evacuated from wuhan china and those workers were not tested for the virus after they had that contact have you personally looked into these allegations alex azar yes we are we are looking into these allegations i am personally involved in doing so first margaret brennan so can you say that this wasn t something that tipped off the spread on the west coast alex azar that is absolutely not the case so first we take the protection of our employees very seriously second we want to make sure isolation and quarantine procedures are followed as appropriate third we appreciate the whistleblower bringing forward any concerns we are aggressively looking into any if to see whether there s validity to the concerns but what the american people should need to know is that we now have passed well over fourteen days since any hhs employee had contact with the individuals involved they are not nobody is symptomatic nobody has a disease even if these allegations prove to be true there was no spreading of the disease from this margaret brennan mm alex azar and we have offered even though it is not medically indicated we have offered to test any hhs employees involved if they would like that extra piece of mind we want to do that for our employees margaret brennan there are cases of the coronavirus in mexico and in canada yesterday the president said he is considering and looking at closing the southern border alex azar well margaret brennan what will decide that are you looking at that alex azar that s not one of the highest priority areas that we re looking at right now because mexico only has a couple of cases canada s epidemiology is similar to the united states right now what the president s making clear though is we ll always be looking at travel restrictions border protections we will take whatever measures are appropriate and necessary to protect the american people but we don t forecast doing that anytime soon margaret brennan do you expect drug shortages as some senators have highlighted concerns there could be because of disruption to the supply chain alex azar so we re very concerned about the intermingling of our supply chain with china in particular we the fda has gone out and worked proactively with drug manufacturers and there are twenty drugs for which the entire molecule or a critical element of the molecule is made exclusively in china and so we re working aggressively with the with the manufacturers to determine if there are any shortages we are aware of one drug which has many many replacements in terms of that therapeutic class available that may be in shortage for a short period of time but margaret brennan what drug is that alex azar i m not able to because it s commercially confidential information that s submitted voluntarily to us i m not able to discuss that but this is a drug in a class where there are many many many alternatives available it s a generic drug very available margaret brennan all right mister secretary thank you for your time and we will be right back with another cabinet official secretary of state mike pompeo so stay with us announcements margaret brennan yesterday the u s signed a deal with the taliban that may lead to a full withdrawal of u s troops from afghanistan since it began in 2001 the war has claimed the lives of more than two thousand four hundred american troops secretary of state mike pompeo is just back from the signing ceremony in doha he got off the plane just a short while ago and thank you for being here mister secretary mike pompeo secretary of state secpompeo thank you margaret brennan so this is significant and according to the deal that was released the u s will bring down troops to eight thousand six hundred in the next hundred and thirty five days and then if conditions are met a total withdrawal within fourteen months but the president said yesterday if bad things happen we ll go back in what s the benchmark there mike pompeo yes ma am this was a historic day american blood and treasure have been expended in this place for an awfully long time we went there after 9 11 no one still feels the anger of that day any more than i do but it was time and the taliban knew it was time president trump has allowed us to take the fight to the taliban these last two years and we have done so it s why they for the first time have announced that they re prepared to break with their historic ally al qaida who they ve worked with much the det detriment of the united states of america you can see go read the document the taliban have now made the break they ve said they will not permit terror to be thrust upon anyone including the united states from afghanistan this is historic in that way and no one should underestimate the trump administration you can see our work on counterterror whether it s al baghdadi qassem al rimi margaret brennan how long will it take mike pompeo the work that we did against qassem soleimani this is a president who is committed to defending and protecting the american people we ll do that every place we battle against terror whether that s afghanistan or any of the other dozens of places we push back each and every day margaret brennan how long would it take to get u s troops out because you re saying this is based on conditions that means the taliban has to follow through on a few things mike pompeo yes margaret brennan what would make the president hit the brakes and stop the withdrawal mike pompeo look we can t get into hypotheticals about what it would take exactly but there is a detailed set of commitments that the taliban have made about the levels of violence that can occur the nature of what s got to take place we are hopeful that in the coming days there will be inter afghan negotiations that commence as well that has not happened before it s going to be rocky and bumpy no one no one is under any false illusion that this won t be a difficult conversation but that conversation for the first time in almost two decades will be among the afghan people and that s the appropriate place for that conversation to take place we re we re prepared to do what it takes to ensure that we keep america safe we ve asked everyone there to reduce the levels of violence both the afghan national margaret brennan right mike pompeo security forces and the taliban margaret brennan but president trump said he s going to meet with the taliban in the near future when where is that camp david mike pompeo i don t know when i don t know where i i m very confident president trump wants to make sure that everyone in afghanistan understands that the united states is committed to making sure that this conversation take place we have been at this for an awful long time you recounted the loss of american life there s a better path forward the taliban now know this because of the work that we ve done and president trump will be actively engaged in helping us get the conditions right and beginning this journey that the first step was taken in doha yesterday margaret brennan we re going to take a break and continue the conversation on the other side of it please stay with us we hope you will too announcements margaret brennan secretary pompeo is here for more on ending america s longest war and then a look at politics and super tuesday announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation and we are continuing our conversation with secretary of state mike pompeo who is just back in the u s after signing a deal with the taliban in doha and and just that statement alone is kind of amazing you were the first u s cabinet official to ever meet with a member of the taliban i think you actually met with one of the founding members of the taliban who is involved in this mike pompeo i met with a senior negotiator yesterday yes margaret brennan you you called them terrorists in the past do you still consider the taliban terrorists mike pompeo they have an enormous amount of american blood on their hands margaret brennan and apparently in a partnership still with al qaeda mike pompeo yep they said yesterday signed a document the gentleman whom i met with agreed that they would break that relationship and that they would work alongside of us to destroy deny resources to and to have al qaeda depart from that place margaret brennan and you trust that mike pompeo don t trust anything we re going to deliver it s about actions the agreements that set out the conditions that set out the space but no this deal doesn t depend upon trusting anyone it has a deep complex well thought out multi month negotiated verification complex and mechanism by which we can observe and hold every member of the agreement accountable we ll do that it s not about trust it s about what happens on the ground to not only yesterday which was an important day but in the days that follow margaret brennan the u s pledged in this agreement which is public as you say that it will help to get up to five thousand taliban prisoners released the president of afghanistan ashraf ghani says no way no how he nothing like that was agreed to all of this is supposed to happen in the next ten days did the u s agree to help release five thousand prisoners mike pompeo you saw what the document says it says we will work with all relevant margaret brennan so ghani what he is saying is wrong mike pompeo it says that we will work with all relevant parties to build on confidence to create confidence building measures amongst all of the parties the afghan government non taliban and others in the afghan we we want this to be an inclusive process margaret brennan but it s a process mike pompeo we want we want women margaret brennan this would be a spoiler in just mike pompeo we want we want margaret brennan the first ten days mike pompeo we want women to be involved they there will be lots of people say things there will be lots of noise everyone is competing for attention and time in the media what matters is the actions that we take the discussions that we had we have come a long ways and we have worked not only yesterday while i was in doha secretary of defense was in kabul along with nato secretary general stoltenberg they made a declaration there was a commitment from the afghan government too we ve made a lot of progress no one is under any illusion that this will be straightforward we ve built an important base where we can begin to bring american soldiers home reduce the risk of the loss of life of any american in afghanistan and hopefully set the conditions so the afghan people can build out a peaceful resolution to their now what for them is a forty year struggle margaret brennan well putting five thousand or up to five thousand fighters back on the field is obviously would have a significant impact on on any of the implementation one would think so are are mike pompeo so there have been there there there have margaret brennan do you expect this to actually happen mike pompeo there have been prisoner releases from both sides before we have managed to figure our path forward we ll know who these people are we are working to build out a set of confidence measures that will do for america what president trump has committed reduce our cost in blood and treasure and keep america safe from terrorism i don t think any american can doubt president trump s seriousness in that margaret brennan congresswoman liz cheney republican and about twenty allies mike pompeo who i know well margaret brennan who you know well wasn t very happy with you this week though because she released a public letter saying that there are problems with this that you you you are pretending that the taliban can be counterterrorism partners and saying you know the taliban is still allied with al qaeda and pointed out you personally when you were a member of congress mike pompeo mm hm margaret brennan she suggested wouldn t accept a deal like this that you raised concerns about secret side deals that the obama administration had cut with iran mike pompeo right margaret brennan back then so that any kind mike pompeo oh i remember it well yes margaret brennan of annex she says there are secret annexes to this deal mike pompeo yes she she i m happy to talk with her there there are margaret brennan are there mike pompeo there are no annexes that the members of congress won t have a chance to see margaret brennan meaning they are all classified details mike pompeo the public the public document margaret brennan that will be shared with congress mike pompeo the public document was released yesterday there are two implementing elements that will be provided they are secret they are military implementation documents that are important to protect our soldiers sailors airmen and marines every member of congress will get a chance to see them they are classified secret there aren t any side deals remember the side deals i was complaining about were deals that the american side margaret brennan mm hm mike pompeo never got to see john kerry never got to see those side deals this is this is not that this is a fully transparent arrangement and as for and as margaret brennan so there is no deal to keep a certain u s military presence in afghanistan mike pompeo and there the document that was made public yesterday is the complete agreement the implementing elements of that will be available for every member of congress to see know this i saw what congresswoman cheney said and i have an enormous amount of respect for her the american people should know donald trump is not going to take words on a paper we are going to see if the taliban are prepared to live up to the commitments they ve made the bush administration and the obama administration both tried to get the words that were on the paper yesterday that the taliban would break from al qaeda publicly we got that that s important now time will tell if they ll live up to that commitment is our expectation they have promised us they will do so and we ll be able to see on the ground everything they do or choose not to do margaret brennan well it s a historic agreement mike pompeo thank you very much margaret margaret brennan secretary thank you for coming on to talk about it we ll be right back announcements excerpt from a campaign video margaret brennan that was businessman tom steyer doing a little pre primary dance in south carolina he did come in third but he had hoped to do better and he dropped out of the race last night but rest of the candidates have moved on to super tuesday and that s this tuesday when fourteen states will hold contests among them california and texas we have some new cbs news battleground tracker numbers for both of them out in california senator bernie sanders is up with thirty one percent support former vice president joe biden and massachusetts senator elizabeth warren come in behind sanders with nineteen and eighteen percent respectively former new york city mayor michael bloomberg has twelve percent and the rest of the field comes in at under ten percent looking to texas the race is tighter bernie sanders is in the lead here with thirty percent but joe biden close behind him with twenty six percent and elizabeth warren comes in at seventeen percent support michael bloomberg is at thirteen percent and the rest of the field comes in at six percent or less joining us once again is cbs news elections and surveys director anthony salvanto we want to bring in cbs news political correspondent ed o keefe ed this was a big and much needed win for joe biden in south carolina what does this mean for him going into tuesday ed o keefe cbs news political correspondent edokeefe well his team would tell you this is the momentum they need to convince any late deciding voter who is not a fan of bernie sanders to side with them instead their hope is that by the end of tuesday he emerges as the clear alternative to sanders it s pretty mathematically impossible based on what polling is showing us right now for somebody to surpass sanders especially because he is going to have such a big win it looks like in places like california but they are hoping the biden team is that in the next few days they are able to raise millions of dollars and again convince people that he is the leading alternative margaret brennan anthony does he have the enthusiasm that you say sanders supporters have anthony salvanto cbs news elections and surveys director salvantocbs well that remains a key difference between these candidates which is that bernie sanders supporters are the most enthusiastic of all the top candidates that s why his numbers remain so stable those folks turn out for him but joe biden still has a challenge in that regard his supporters are less enthusiastic about him can he motivate them to turn out i think it remains a key question and look to that point when you look at california texas at these big delegate hauls the democrats give out delegates just to top finishers and so they could very conceivably end up splitting the delegates along with some of these other candidates and then we move on into the spring margaret brennan and there are a lot of delegates at stake here on tuesday a thousand three hundred forty four it s about thirty percent of what s needed for the nomination so ed how do the candidates sort of crack the threshold explain some of the math here ed o keefe so there is essentially two numbers to look at on tuesday night there s the perception number who wins the state who can say that they walked away winning the most states but the more important number ultimately is the nomination number who gets closest to getting the one thousand nine hundred ninety or ninety one delegates you need to get over the threshold and and win that nomination margaret brennan because it s not winner take all ed o keefe it is not you have to hit fifteen percent in each congressional district and in the states and so the numbers to look for are fifteen so if you look at our california and texas numbers right now mike bloomberg is in trouble because he is not hitting fifteen percent this could have been a very expensive overuse of his money if he can t hit fifteen percent in those two states but this is why despite not winning anything so far elizabeth warren is still in this race because she sees that she is doing well enough in california and in texas and in a few of these other states likely that she can get above fifteen percent and keep a pool of delegates that keeps her in the race going into later march and april anthony salvanto and that bloomberg number that you talk about is so critical because if he does do just well enough to pick up delegates if he picks up delegates in some regions of these states even if he doesn t win them then that changes the math for everybody else now he is a player but if he falls just short of it then all those delegates can go to other top candidates to a to a biden or to a sanders and that changes the math going forward for them margaret brennan ed can four hundred million dollars in ad spending close that gap that s a big gamble ed o keefe it could potentially look and tonight he is he is doing something that hasn t been done in a while he is buying three minutes of advertising on nbc and cbs to talk about the coronavirus and trying to cast himself as somebody who is a competent manager who could probably help solve this problem and would have tackled it sooner than the president he can spend as much as he wants but if he doesn t hit fifteen percent in these states on tuesday it will have been for naught essentially certainly they believe that they can go on into florida and arizona and illinois next and and try to compete in later march contests but perhaps the biggest loser last night in south carolina was mike bloomberg because joe biden did so well they needed biden to stumble or to only win narrowly to help make the argument that he is the better moderate alternative margaret brennan it couldn t have felt good for tom steyer to have spent over three hundred million two hundred million dollars almost three hundred million on spending on ads ed o keefe it s a warning sign because south carolina was his was his petri dish margaret brennan right ed o keefe it was his test that if he could do it there he could do it anywhere he couldn t margaret brennan so anthony and ed there are a lot of headlines after south carolina saying this is now a two person race but there are still a lot of people on the field so anthony salvanto it remains a multicandidate race there s no question about it and i think part of that is you look at bernie sanders and you look at despite that enthusiasm that he has can he grow it can he draw people to him and when we ask folks most of the people supporting sanders say they ve already liked him they ve liked him for a long time but far fewer say they ve taken taken a second or third look at him as he s won these early states so can he translate any success he s had into momentum going forward and build on that twenty five that thirty percent that he s already got that i think remains a key question ed o keefe this will not be clean this is going to be a messy contest it s different than what we ve seen before because we have so many candidates we are down to seven the magnificent seven perhaps who are going into tuesday will the field shrink after tuesday probably but again if you re somebody who can hit viability fifteen percent in a few of these states you have no reason to get out yet margaret brennan it makes for some exciting political watching on tuesday ed o keefe and very little sleep margaret brennan thanks anthony salvanto yes margaret brennan a very little sleep for indistinct anthony salvanto a very long night with delegates coming as we go as we go margaret brennan all right well we ll we ll gear up for that with both of you thank you we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan for a closer look at how prepared we are for the coronavirus here in the u s we turn to former fda commissioner and physician doctor scott got gottlieb good to have you here dr scott gottlieb former fda commissioner scottgottliebmd thanks margaret brennan you served in the trump administration what do you think the administration is doing now that is right wrong in its handling of the virus dr scott gottlieb right well certainly expanding the diagnostic capability is the right move we re going to have the capacity by the end of this week to diagnose probably ten thousand people a day or screen ten thousand people a day with the public health labs hundred labs doing hundreds tests a day by the end of the week after that we ll probably bring on another ten thousand so we ll have testing capacity of perhaps as much as twenty thousand a day by the end of the next two weeks once we bring on the academic labs that was really a critical step bringing on those academic labs margaret brennan mm hm dr scott gottlieb and and leveraging their capacity these are the major medical centers what we need to do now is make a real concerted effort to get a therapeutic we know when this started but we don t know when this is going to end and what s going to end it is our technology our savior here is going to be our technology and we need to make a really robust effort to try to develop a therapeutic margaret brennan meaning a treatment dr scott gottlieb a treatment or a vaccine but a a therapeutic a treatment is going to be more likely to be available in the fall a vaccine is a much longer way off and we always knew when that once in a generation strain came along and this might be that strain that what we were going to have to depend on was our science and something to stop it like a treatment or a vaccine a treatment again we could have by september october potentially margaret brennan but more testing means more positive results i mean you re saying basically expect the number of those who ve been diagnosed with the virus to also increase dr scott gottlieb it s going to increase this right now there s probably hundreds or low thousands of cases everyone s margaret brennan hundreds or low thousands of coronavirus cases dr scott gottlieb in the u s margaret brennan in the u s that aren t reported dr scott gottlieb that aren t reported yet it s a big country three three hundred and forty million people three hundred and thirty million people so anyone s individual risk is is still very low but we need to get those cases diagnosed and identified so we could start getting people quarantined and into treatment and prevent more spread we need to start mitigating the implications of the spread there was an analysis out today by trevor bradford very good researcher out of the hutch looking at the genetic strains in washington state and by looking at the strains and the drift between the different strains for the people who have been diagnosed there he s suggested that there s perhaps hundreds and maybe low thousands of cases it s an interesting analysis there probably are more cases we have community spread now in washington state california perhaps illinois oregon so certainly hundreds of cases margaret brennan so has the administration been slow in its response dr scott gottlieb well look i think the decision the administration made to block the travel which was controversial at the time clearly bought us time it it slowed the introduction of the virus into the country virus was probably here at that time but it slowed additional cases the question is what do we do with that time i think there s some things we did that were very smart we got the country prepared one of the mistakes one of the challenges was getting the diagnostic testing in place i think what what we should have done and i don t want to you know armchair quarterback this we relied on the cdc we always rely on a cdc in a public health emergency but simultaneous to that we should have also been reaching out and trying to get the laboratory developed tests into the game and the manufacturers who have diagnostic capability we ve done that you know a couple of weeks went by and they did that and that is now in place and those labs are going to be coming online so we course corrected i think what it teaches us if you re looking back what is the teachable moment it s don t take a linear approach to these crises take an all of the above approach and we need to do that now in a therapeutic we we can t put all our eggs in the vaccine basket we need to be looking at antibody based prophylaxis treatments vaccines and all of the above approach if case one doesn t work out we have other options margaret brennan so you d suggest that s the conversation the president should have tomorrow with the pharmaceutical companies dr scott gottlieb tomorrow is the vaccine manufacturers margaret brennan when he brings those dr scott gottlieb i think we need to look at the companies that that can develop antibody based prophylaxis as well we did that against ebola that is actually what we could potentially have for the fall fall or a small molecule drug that s currently on the shelf trying to repurpose it for this margaret brennan the nih director anthony fauci a doctor said that from what he s seen if you get infected you likely won t get reinfected but there seems to be so much we don t know if someone has just sort of mild or moderate symptoms how do they last how do you know to go and get tested dr scott gottlieb that s the challenge here you don t you know there isn t the spectrum of disease here is very wide a lot of people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic but they shed virus and they re still infective they can still transfer the virus and a small percentage get very sick and so it s probably the eighty percent that are mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic that are the ones that are spreading it the other thing is that people who get very sick don t get very sick right away the time to hospitalization in in different studies was nine to twelve days so they start off with cold like symptoms and then they progressively get more ill and it s in that phase that people are spreading it there was a very interesting analysis in the new england journal of medicine about two weeks ago that looked at viral load and viral shedding margaret brennan mm hm dr scott gottlieb across a spectrum of disease and the people who are mildly symptomatic shed as much virus as the people who are very sick and that s atypical typically the amount of virus you have and shed to in in some diseases comports with how much how much of virus you have margaret brennan okay doctor thank you very much for coming on and giving us dr scott gottlieb thanks a lot margaret brennan your analysis we ll be back in a moment with a look at super tuesday and more announcements margaret brennan we re back with our panel we brought in two of the big guns from the new york times today edward wong is a diplomatic correspondent and michael crowley is a white house correspondent covering foreign policy good to have you both here michael crowley the new york times michaelcrowley thanks margaret edward wong the new york times ewong thanks margaret margaret brennan i want to start on what we haven t mentioned thus far in the show that the president has made a choice to run the intelligence community he s going to renominate a congressman john ratcliffe is he actually going to go through and get nominated and and confirmed michael crowley well that s a big question you know president trump was getting close to nominating congressman ratcliffe back in the summer and met so much resistance from senior republicans in congress who said this man is not qualified he s only been on the intelligence committee for a year may have inflated his resume and is much more partisan around the people who ve held that job the president pulled back and didn t do it the question is now has ratcliffe changed any minds there s not a lot of evidence to that but there may be a little bit of a game going on here because the president has installed richard grenell his ambassador to germany in that job in an acting basis and because of complicated things that have to do with the the how long acting directors can serve by nominating a new person even if president trump doesn t think ratcliffe can get confirmed that allows rick grenell to stay in that job for a longer amount of time there s another theory that rick grenell is even more unpalatable to people in congress than ratcliffe so ratcliffe may be the more acceptable alternative so there s a lot going on here and people are trying to figure out what s real and what isn t margaret brennan well i bring that up first because it gets to some of what we have been talking about today in terms of confidence in professionals versus political choices made for political reasons and and confidence in in hard fact and in intelligence ed i know you ve been following as you always do you lived in china for so long and you followed the origins of this outbreak of corona when you heard the administration this week change its language so many times in describing and characterizing response what did you make of that and what do you make of what is actually known in terms of what china is sharing with the u s edward wong well i think that everyone agrees that full transparency or a large amount of transparency on this virus is necessary both you know to push forward with expertise on addressing the virus plus calming public fears over it i think when an administration or government appears to be nontransparent on it then that creates problems i think that the trump administration really grappled with that this past week when you saw president trump come out and say it was a new hoax by the democrats or when margaret brennan and his chief of staff went out and and said the media s covering this edward wong right margaret brennan because they think it s going to take down the president edward wong right and i think that they re trying to adjust the language now from what i can tell but i think that you know there s valid criticism of that and i think if you compare that to the way beijing reacted there are some parallels in that communist party officials chinese officials really covered up the start of the virus and there s a lot of information coming out these days that perhaps it started earlier and that they kept the public from learning about it we know that one of the key whistleblowers dr li margaret brennan mm hm edward wong tried to warn health care professionals in a private chat group about it and then he was even taken in by the police because of that and admonished margaret brennan right michael crowley yeah margaret brennan michael i mean does the president now have the credibility and and the trust of the public at a moment of crisis when you need it most michael crowley no that s a huge problem here margaret think back to what happened when hurricane dorian was hitting the united states last summer president trump made an inaccurate comment about the hurricane s path and was criticized for it and then a day or two later he s holding up a map showing the storm s forecasted path in the oval office and it appears to have been doctored with just the kind of sharpie pen that president trump loves to use to sign documents it really looks like they were altering information they were giving the public to make the president look good to cover up for a mistake he had made and president trump has repeatedly bungled basic facts including numbers of victims in the country yesterday he got the gender wrong of the person who died in washington although he may have been briefed inaccurately i will say margaret that i do think that that briefing yesterday was a step in the right direction having all those health experts there margaret brennan right michael crowley particularly doctor fauci there were questions about whether he was being muzzled he said he was not one of the nation s foremost authorities on these things and i think president trump understands he doesn t he wants the markets to bounce back the markets want to see that kind of expertise in trump expertise and and and credibility and at least yesterday there was a step in that direction margaret brennan well we will see when markets open tomorrow what they thought of it but certainly for the public we ll continue to follow the details of this as we have on face the nation thank you all today for watching and each week as
