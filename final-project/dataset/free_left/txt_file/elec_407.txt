advertisement supported by political memo by jonathan martin and alexander burns charleston s c it is not yet clear which republican presidential candidate will emerge from saturday s south carolina primary with the biggest boost but it is becoming increasingly apparent which two would suffer most from a disappointing performance south carolina will render a brutal and perhaps final verdict on jeb bush s campaign if he does not at least finish close to senator marco rubio of florida mr bush the former florida governor has made an all out push here campaigning aggressively for 10 days and bringing in his brother former president george w bush for his first public campaign speech in nearly a decade failing to break through after all that would raise fundamental questions about mr bush s ability to consolidate support from mainstream republican voters late thursday he acknowledged a mounting sense of gloom i hope that you believe that it s possible for us to do this mr bush told voters in rock hill as he wrapped up a town hall style forum i hope you don t think the end is near among the hard line conservatives in the race senator ted cruz of texas will face new questions about the potential of his campaign if he is unable to broaden his appeal and continues to allow donald j trump the heavy favorite here to cut into his support from evangelical christians mr bush and mr cruz are not seen as competing directly with each other and their support comes from starkly different pools of voters but for both men the gravest danger this weekend is that they end up being overshadowed in a lasting way by their most immediate competitors just as the primary campaign begins to spread across a wider map of states in march anybody who finishes below third will raise serious questions about how they go forward former gov haley barbour of mississippi said when asked what was at stake for mr bush and that message will be most pronounced by those candidates donors mr bush and mr cruz are plainly aware of the pressure on their candidacies here and they are hurrying to make their cases to voters while also showing signs of frustration mr bush has alternated between expressions of exasperation we don t have to go vote i guess it s all finished i should just stop campaigning maybe huh he said wednesday and demonstrative pleas for support i m going to get on my hands and knees and ask for your vote after i answer this he told an undecided woman in columbia on thursday when she asked him about education policy mr cruz s performance has been just as dizzying a spaghetti at the wall medley of attacks self defense and spectacle after he absorbed blows on the issue of defense where mr rubio in particular has branded him as dovish mr cruz s team hastily convened a gathering on tuesday aboard an aircraft carrier near here where he unveiled a set of national security proposals on wednesday he mused to the news media for 40 minutes about how much he looked forward to deposing mr trump should the litigious new yorker sue him and on thursday mr cruz suggested that his texas roots left him well positioned to understand south carolinians i m told people in south carolina kind of like their guns he said at a republican women s club event in greenville i have to say as a texan i understand remember the alamo for mr rubio too much is at stake he is seen as the candidate who has gained the most ground over the last week and is campaigning with south carolina s popular governor nikki r haley at his side polls show that mr rubio remains broadly appealing to a cross section of republican primary voters in south carolina and nationally with many voters describing him as their second choice the same is not true for mr bush whose appeal seems confined to moderates or for mr cruz whose popularity among strongly ideological activists has not translated into a wider national following the race in south carolina has illustrated mr cruz s basic predicament he has been pinched between mr trump s anti establishment legions and mr rubio s looser coalition of mainstream republicans and evangelical voters if mr cruz cannot win votes outside of the hard right here he will most likely struggle to win larger states against mr trump and mr rubio even in the conservative deep south cruz s only path in a three way race is to get it to a two way said carl forti a republican strategist absent strong showings saturday mr bush and mr cruz could face the embarrassing prospect of losing their home states mr bush who has little cash left would have a hard time even lasting until florida s march 15 primary mr cruz would still be formidable when texas and a host of other states vote on march 1 but an overwhelming win here by mr trump would force him to spend time and money in texas rather than strictly playing offense in conservative states like georgia and tennessee william j miller an influential texas lobbyist who has not endorsed a presidential candidate said the race in texas could become a blowout for mr trump if no one slows him in south carolina or nevada which votes on tuesday it s his game right now mr miller said of mr trump if he sweeps it these other candidates will get swept out and he ll come into texas with the wind at his back in that event mr miller said the hard line mr cruz would find himself scrambling to get support from people who are not necessarily friends of his mr cruz s advisers argue that they have the potential to build support among several groups most notably libertarians still casting about for a candidate since senator rand paul of kentucky s departure from the race an ad released on thursday titled nevada land seemed directly aimed at libertarians it attacked mr trump for refusing to say he would return federal land to nevada s residents for mr bush the situation is far more dire after finishing narrowly ahead of mr rubio in new hampshire mr bush has been upstaged by him here mr bush began the week with a forceful debate performance and an energetic campaign swing with his brother but by wednesday the center of attention had shifted to mr rubio and his endorsement from ms haley who is appearing in a new ad for mr rubio and campaigning alongside him mr bush s campaign has worked to demonstrate that he is in the race for the long haul and capable of a strong finish here a set of talking points emailed to his supporters on thursday and provided to a new york times reporter by a recipient highlighted mr bush s endorsements from south carolinians including senator lindsey graham and noted that ms haley s endorsement of mitt romney in 2012 had not stopped newt gingrich from defeating mr romney in the primary here but mr bush s problems in south carolina go beyond mr rubio he also appears to be losing votes to gov john kasich of ohio who is wooing the sort of moderates who might otherwise be in mr bush s camp every vote he gets comes from us mr graham said of mr kasich he s done more damage to us than haley has helped rubio advertisement
