hurt very badly but they understand this is the right thing to do and i have great respect for it trump told reporters during a bilateral meeting with egyptian president abdel fattah el sisi on the sidelines of the g 7 summit advertisement they want to make a deal trump continued that s a great thing chinese foreign ministry spokesperson geng shuang appeared to dispute trump s claim that such

liu he had called for talks to resume when trump pressed him for details during a bilateral meeting later in the afternoon with the indian prime minister it was not immediately clear however if mnuchin was referring to a phone call liu made to u s officials or his comments at a technology conference earlier in the day trump reiterated monday that china wants to reach a deal on trade very badly repeating claims that the country s economy is bending under the pressure of u s tariffs i think they want to make a deal i m not sure they have a choice and i don t say that as a threat he said in a joint news conference with french president emmanuel macron but the confusion continued over whether a call between u s and chinese officials actually took place and if so when it occurred in addition no date for an expected round of high level talks in september has been announced we ve had many calls trump said monday when pressed by a reporter on the issue secretary mnuchin is here and he s had many calls over the last 24 hours but certainly over the last 48 hours we ve had many calls not just one these are high level calls they want to make a deal and by the way i think a deal is going to be made macron said trump in private meetings with other g 7 leaders clearly showed us his willingness to arrive at an agreement with china what s bad for the world economy is uncertainty and the quicker an agreement is arrived at the quicker that uncertainty will dissipate macron said that s what we discussed yesterday and that s the american president s wish trump s whiplash inducing comments come just 24 hours after white house officials seeking to clarify a statement the president made about having second thoughts on his escalating trade war said his only regret was that he didn t raise tariffs further on chinese imports that claim followed trump s announcement friday that he planned to increase existing tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods from 25 percent to 30 percent and to hike a new round of tariffs on another 300 billion in chinese exports from 10 percent to 15 percent asked about the mixed signals coming out of the white house trump shrugged and said sorry it s the way i negotiate it s done very well for me over the years and it s doing better for the country then he again blamed his predecessors for allowing china to run up a huge trade surplus with the united states and failing to take strong steps to deal with unfair trade practices and the theft of u s intellectual property adding to the confusion trump projected an air of indifference over the past several days about whether a deal would be reached because of the tariff revenue now being collected on chinese imports i m getting a lot of money in tariffs it s coming in by the billions trump told reporters here sunday morning adding that he believes china wants to make a deal much more than i do the president also opened the door to using his executive powers to declare a national emergency with respect to china s trade practices saying however that he currently has no plans to do so it has become unquestionably clear that the administration s tariff war against china is politically motivated what washington wants from its largest trade partner is for it to be content to play second fiddle and meekly do as it demands china daily a state owned newspaper wrote in an editorial on sunday by monday however both u s and chinese officials appeared open to resuming talks on trade that is as long as such discussions remain calm liu said at a conference in china we think an escalation of the trade war is against the interest of china the u s and the entire world said liu who is china s top trade negotiator trump said he appreciated liu s call for discussions to remain calm and said he felt the same way even though it was the united states that ratcheted up tensions in recent weeks by announcing a new round of tariff increases i thought it was a beautiful statement trump said in response to liu i thought it indicated a lot liu added that china will strive to protect the integrity of industrial chains an element of the trade dispute that trump mentioned earlier in the day they have supply chains that are unbelievably intricate and people are leaving and they are going to other countries including the united states by the way trump said many household u s companies have supply chains in china where major disruptions have occurred as a result of the ongoing trade war on monday trump suggested the u s is going to get a lot of production back if his administration reaches a deal with the chinese liu who never mentioned whether phone conversations took place said beijing is willing to solve the problem through consultation and cooperation with a calm attitude trump has used the g 7 summit to advance his trade agenda in the face of skeptical european allies including by announcing sunday that he and japan had reached an agreement in principle on trade he and british prime minister boris johnson also discussed the broad contours of a bilateral trade deal once the united kingdom leaves the european union johnson has set a deadline of october for his nation s departure from the european union which he s repeatedly said will occur with or without a deal with the eu with hours to go before the three day summit concludes and he returns to washington trump said the u s is in a stronger position now to do a deal a fair deal for everyone with china anything s possible trump said monday we re having very meaningful talks much more
