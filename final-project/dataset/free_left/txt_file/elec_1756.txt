 analysis a broad convincing win should make republicans nervous about november scott olson getty images by tim alberta 03 11 2020 08 37 am edt link copied tim alberta is chief political correspondent at politico magazine maybe you ve never heard of livingston county michigan it s not oakland county the vote rich behemoth located next door nor is it macomb county the much mythologized home of the culturally conservative reagan democrats who began defecting to the republican party decades ago it s a lot less populated and a little too far from detroit to attract much notice from journalists and pundits and yet as the returns rolled in tuesday night from michigan s primary it was livingston that told the most compelling story not for what it said about bernie sanders or joe biden but for what it said about donald trump four years ago livingston was a safe haven for republicans voters there white educated upper class commuters who head east to detroit south to ann arbor and west to lansing gave no hint of a coming realignment the county s congressional seat property of the gop for 15 years was locked down its political culture anchored by a love of god guns and tax cuts seemed uncrackable when the presidential primaries were held the republican contest attracted nearly three times as many voters than the democratic counterpart trump carried the county by 30 percentage points against hillary clinton in november 2016 arguably his most impressive pound for pound showing in the state advertisement today republicans are looking over their shoulders in livingston county and for good reason they re not worried trump is going to lose there they re not worried about a wholesale change in the area s political dna they re worried about the only thing that matters in michigan margins the reason livingston is now represented by a democrat in congress is because elissa slotkin the freshman democrat only lost the county by 19 points limiting the damage in a way that allowed her to eke out an upset win with strong performances elsewhere in michigan s 8th congressional district there was a temptation for republicans to dismiss slotkin s victory as an outlier to not sweat a 30 point margin slipping to a 19 point margin but there can no longer be any doubt about the trajectory of livingston county and the trouble it poses for the gop in tuesday s democratic primary there were 27 458 votes cast in the county compared with 17 591 four years ago for democratic turnout to jump 56 percent in any affluent well educated suburb is incredible for it to happen in a deeply fundamentally conservative place like livingston county is astounding some people might think a difference of some 10 000 votes is no big deal but in a state that was decided by some 10 000 votes it s a very big deal biden had a spectacular showing on tuesday winning every single county in michigan and blowing sanders out in three other states that voted essentially sealing the nomination by leaving his lone rival no plausible path forward but the big takeaway from the day s big prize michigan isn t that biden is a spectacular candidate the big takeaway is that he doesn t need to be two things happened on tuesday in michigan first democratic turnout exploded second biden performed far better with key demographic groups than clinton did four years ago if either one of those things happens in november trump will have a difficult time winning the state again if both things happen the president can kiss michigan s 16 electoral votes goodbye and with them more than likely the electoral votes of wisconsin and pennsylvania there goes the white house this week from politico magazine china by anka lee history dept by dan goldberg investigation by ben schreckinger and mona zhang culture club by bryan bender the friday cover by matt dixon letter from michigan by tim alberta opinion fourth estate by jack shafer altitude by john f harris opinion by rich lowry trumpology by michael kruse far fetched hardly beating trump in november does not require an electoral juggernaut this is because trump himself despite his frequent boasts to the contrary is no electoral juggernaut the president won the electoral college in 2016 by a whisker he carried three states michigan wisconsin pennsylvania by a combined 77 744 votes notably in those states clinton won roughly 600 000 fewer votes than barack obama did in 2012 the reason a failure to mobilize black voters and dismal performances among both affluent suburbanites and working class whites the question that has hung over this democratic race is one of electability the search for someone who could address those specific shortcomings in those specific states and defeat trump biden still has plenty of detractors in the party he still makes many democrats queasy every time he starts speaking off the cuff but after tuesday there can be no disputing his capacity for winning in november last night proved it beyond doubt joe biden is no hillary clinton and that may be enough to take down trump on march 9 2016 the morning after the michigan primaries i published a reported analysis in national review michigan shows trump could redraw electoral map vs clinton this wasn t clairvoyance by any stretch between studying the exit polls and splicing the election results it was impossible to ignore the storm brewing in my home state trump was supercharging turnout and forging a unique appeal with independents and white working class voters clinton was flopping with those same groups while struggling to energize black voters and young people two vital pieces of the coalition that had lifted obama to victories in 2008 and 2012 if this was happening in michigan i wrote it was happening in ohio wisconsin and pennsylvania too nothing i ve ever written provoked so much scorn emails rained down by the hundred didn t i know about the blue wall of states democrats couldn t possibly lose yes i sure did but the evidence of change was too compelling to ignore and so even though i reserved the right to change my mind which i did buckling to the onslaught of lopsided polling and predicting that trump would lose in november there was ample reason to suspect that those primary results might foreshadow the november election in that sense tuesday felt like a mirror image of 2016 there is no question trump has advantages heading into the fall he has a sprawling campaign apparatus an unprecedented amount of money and as always the attention of the world and a knack for knowing how to exploit it by every tangible metric the president will be tougher to beat as an incumbent than he was as a rookie candidate and yet the evidence of his vulnerability is too compelling to ignore this is particularly true of a match up with biden in the three states that will help determine the outcome this november if the 2016 primary resembled a giant mitten shaped red flag for democrats as i wrote the other day this 2020 primary resembled a giant mitten shaped red flag for trump start with the suburbanites politico newsletters get politico magazine s newsletter featuring the best stories

won the 11th district much the same way slotkin did in the 8th by limiting her losses in the most conservative precincts running for governor on the same ticket gretchen whitmer won oakland by a whopping 17 points more than twice clinton s margin of victory in 2016 bending sharply the trajectory of a county that for decades has been a bastion of country club center right republicanism if tuesday was any indication things won t get easier for the gop this fall voters overran the polls in oakland county four years after a total turnout of roughly 180 000 in the democratic primary oakland had counted more than 250 000 votes on tuesday with 90 percent of precincts reporting when the final votes are tabulated oakland will have witnessed a turnout increase in the neighborhood of 45 percent the story isn t just the voting spike but biden s concurrent performance unofficially he beat sanders by 22 points in oakland county where clinton beat sanders by just 4 points in 2016 and whereas clinton won roughly 92 000 votes there biden is on pace to win more than 150 000 it was a similar story in neighboring macomb county a more downscale suburb of detroit where turnout soared and biden vastly outperformed clinton nearly 130 000 people participated in the democratic primary up 33 percent from 2016 and whereas four years ago clinton and sanders fought macomb to a virtual draw with clinton winning some 47 500 votes biden topped sanders by 17 points collecting more than 66 000 votes in the process biden s performance among the wealthier suburbanites in these counties should be highly worrisome to trump these voters particularly whites with college degrees are accepting of the former vice president in a way they never were of clinton four years ago exit polling of michigan s primary showed sanders winning college educated whites by 11 points biden beat sanders among that demographic by 14 points on tuesday a 25 point swing if more of those upper scale suburbanites are found in oakland then macomb is home to more middle class metro detroiters interestingly and just as worrisome for republicans both groups behaved the same way at the polls sanders who won whites without a college degree by 15 points over clinton lost them by 10 points to biden that s an identical 25 point swing this was visible not only in southeast michigan but in mid michigan northern michigan and the upper peninsula conservative rural areas that were dominated by sanders four years ago with most of the votes counted biden appeared poised to win every single one of those counties north of ingham many of them by healthy margins an astonishing feat the story of the trump realignment has been an exchange between the two parties more of the well educated suburbanites fleeing the gop for the democratic ranks with more of the blue collar rural and exurban voters joining the republican party this tradeoff while unsustainable for the gop over future election cycles never figured to torpedo trump s reelection but what biden demonstrated on tuesday was an ability to have it both ways accelerating the gop s exodus in the suburbs while stopping his party s bleeding in the exurban and rural areas beyond if he can do that in november he ll win but there s an even more pressing imperative for biden next fall mobilizing black voters for all his successes in michigan on tuesday here s an area where he failed to distinguish himself from clinton and thus an area where his campaign might want to worry exit polls showed black voters accounting for 18 percent of the primary electorate down slightly from 21 percent four years ago biden carried this group by 39 points essentially identical to clinton s 40 point win making this all the more intriguing was turnout in wayne county the democratic beachhead that s anchored by detroit participation was up but only by 41 612 votes over 2016 a modest 15 percent increase the statewide voting increase will clock in at more than 400 000 votes or roughly 35 percent overall once the final precincts are tallied it was a similar story in genesee county home to flint where turnout bumped up just a few thousand votes from 2016 the numbers were better for democrats in ingham county and saginaw county both of which have sizable black populations but given the well documented failures of clinton to energize this core constituency in michigan and considering trump s determination to whittle away at those all important margins particularly among black men this is a problem democrats need to address it might be meaningless that exit polls show biden winning blacks by far bigger margins in the south than in the midwest but it s not something democrats can leave to chance setting aside these mixed results with black voters the breadth of biden s win in michigan suggests he ll be formidable in november he won men and women college graduates and non college graduates middle income voters and high income voters union households and non union households there is room for improvement not just with blacks but with young people and self described progressives as well but the truth is no democratic nominee in recent memory has had so much of the party consolidated around them this early in the nominating process this electoral climate is historically volatile having been impeached only months ago and now presiding over a reeling economy and facing a potential pandemic as the novel coronavirus spreads throughout the united states the president will be walking through a minefield all the way to november trump has proved to be such a masterful political houdini escaping from one jam after another that he has taken on an aura of invincibility his inner circle has come to believe trump cannot be defeated nothing they say not the mueller investigation or the crisis at the southern border or the government shutdown or the ukraine whistleblower or the blue wave in the midterm elections or even the early primary results has demonstrated any capacity for the democrats to take down the president that might be true but tuesday felt different a day we ll look back on if in fact trump loses there are six to eight battleground states that will decide the election this fall and three that will continue to receive the most attention by far michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania finally one of them has voted giving us a long awaited window into november if the president was looking he couldn t have liked what he saw link copied 2020 politico llc
