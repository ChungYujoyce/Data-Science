the need for federal funding as they deal with the pandemic s brutal impact on their state budgets sayscbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro most states are expecting to see a substantial loss in tax revenue due to the economic downturn and some are already acknowledging the incoming budget cuts to come republican governor kristi noem said that while her state has always been a really thrifty state they ll be seeing a substantial tax revenue loss all i really want to do is make sure that i don t have to slash teacher funding to make sure that i don t have to slash highway maintenance she said i don t want to have to cut funding for nursing homes but that is situation that they are putting me in now that is not conservative in response to senate majority leader

dumb ideas of all time the entire nation is dependent on what the governors do to reopen but then you re not going to fund the state government you think i m going to do it alone how do you think this is going to work cuomo said thursday i mean for crying out loud if there s ever a time to stop your obsessive political bias and anger now is the time the decimating of state budgets comes as states

drop from the 5 2 million claims for the week ending april 11 more than 6 million people filed claims in the weeks ending april 4 and march 28 the advance number of continuing claims for the week ending april 11 is just under 16 million that indicates how many people are actually receiving unemployment benefits before the coronavirus pandemic the previous weekly high for continuing claims was 6 6 million people in may 2009 those numbers are all seasonally adjusted which attempts to measure and remove the influences of predictable seasonal patterns to show how employment levels change over time the unadjusted numbers show that more than 24 3 million workers have filed claims the past five weeks that dwarfs previous five week stretches according to heidi shierholz who served as chief economist at the labor department from 2014 2017 during the obama administration and is now with the economic policy institute in the period before the coronavirus hit just over a million workers would apply for ui in a typical five week span and in the worst five week stretch of the great recession it was less than four million shierholz wrote in ablog post she says more than 1 in 7 workers have lost jobs based on the unadjusted jobless numbers shierholz also estimates that about 71 of people who have filed for unemployment between march 14 and april 11 are receiving their benefits
