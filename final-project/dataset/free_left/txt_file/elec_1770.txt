advertisement supported by by alan rappeport senator bernie sanders the vermont independent announced thursday that he was running for president as a democrat injecting a progressive voice into the contest and providing hillary rodham clinton with her first official rival for the party s nomination avoiding the fanfare that several republicans have chosen so far when announcing their candidacies mr sanders issued a statement to supporters that laid out his goals for reducing income inequality addressing climate change and scaling back the influence of money in politics after a year of travel discussion and dialogue i have decided to be a candidate for the democratic nomination for president mr sanders said in an email early thursday transcript shows washington dc united states april 30 2015 reuters access all 1 u s senator bernie sanders walking to podium 2 soundbite english u s senator bernie sanders saying this country today in my view has more serious crises than any time since the great depression of the 1930 s for most americans their reality is that they are working longer hours for lower wages and inflation adjusted income they are earning less money than they used to years ago despite a great increase in technology and productivity so all over this country i have been talking to people and they say how does it happen i am producing more but i am working longer hours for lower wages my kid can t afford to go to college i am having a hard time affording healthcare how does that happen while at exactly the same time 99 percent of all new income generated in this country is going to the top one percent how does it happen that the top one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and my conclusion is that that type of economics is not only immoral it is not only wrong it is unsustainable it can t continue we can t continue having a nation in which we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major nation on earth at the same time as we are seeing a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires 3 wide of sander at microphone pan to press 4 soundbite english u s senator bernie sanders saying we now have a political situation where billionaires are literally able to buy elections and candidates let s not kid ourselves that is the reality right now so you got the koch brothers and other billionaire families now prepared to spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in elections to buy the candidates of their choice often extreme right wing candidates i am the former chairman of the senate veterans affairs committee and i can tell you i don t believe that the men and women who defended american democracy fought to create a situation where billionaires own the political process mr sanders s bid is considered a long shot but his unflinching commitment to stances popular with the left such as opposing foreign military interventions and reining in big banks could force mrs clinton to address these issues more deeply on a patch of grass known as the swamp outside the capitol mr sanders later articulated before a horde of journalists and a few curious onlookers why he was running he acknowledged that he faced big financial challenges but said that as a politician with the most unusual political history of anyone in congress he was optimistic about his chances we re in this race to win he said mr sanders plans to hold a formal campaign kickoff on may 26 in burlington vt where he was once mayor but he will hit the campaign trail this weekend holding an event in manchester n h where the nation s first primary is being held in february and he is expected to make accessibility a hallmark of his campaign this is not going to be i ll give you two questions and see you later an adviser said in an apparent reference to mrs clinton s campaign style donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention mr sanders 73 has said that he will not run a negative campaign and that he has never run an attack ad in his life a self described democratic socialist and grumpy grandfather type mr sanders has promised to steer the democratic party toward a mature debate about the issues he is passionate about while traveling the country considering a run mr sanders has acknowledged that going up against mrs clinton will be a daunting financial challenge he has 4 6 million available for his 2018 senate re election campaign that he can use for a presidential run and mr sanders said he hoped to galvanize a movement of small donors to give himself a fighting chance we re not going to raise 2 billion and we re not going to raise 1 billion said mr sanders who added that he did not intend to use the help of a super pac i do not have millionaire or billionaire friends in a speech at the national press club in washington on march 9 mr sanders said he fantasized about getting 3 million supporters to each donate 100 to his campaign the total he joked would be about a third of what the billionaire koch brothers planned to spend to elect a republican president born in brooklyn mr sanders served for 16 years as vermont s sole congressman before he was elected to the senate in 2006 he often brags about being the longest serving independent in congressional history but he plans to run for president as a democrat to avoid the obstacles of getting on state ballots and participating in debates democrats who have been hoping for more liberal candidates to enter the race such as senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts or former gov martin o malley of maryland cheered mr sanders s decision having bernie sanders in the race calling for populism will help open the political space for people like hillary clinton and others to take bold stands said adam green a co founder of the progressive change campaign committee if anything mr sanders who embraces his reputation for being gruff abrupt and honest promises to be bold recalling that he has defeated democrats and republicans with far greater financial resources in his long career mr sanders suggested that his campaign should not be taken lightly i think people should be a little bit careful underestimating me he said advertisement
