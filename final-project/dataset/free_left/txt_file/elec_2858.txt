advertisement supported by by peter baker washington at 6 14 p m on june 7 2016 donald trump jr clicked the send button on an email to confirm a meeting with a woman described as a russian government attorney who would give him information that would incriminate hillary and her dealings with russia three hours later his father donald j trump claimed victory in the finalprimary racespropelling him to the republicanpresidentialnomination and a general election contest against former secretary of state hillary clinton in his victory speech mr trump promised to deliver a major address detailing mrs clinton s corrupt dealings to give favorable treatment to foreign governments including the russians the white house said the timing wasa coincidence the younger mr trump said this week that he never told his father about the meeting with the russian lawyer and the president said on wednesday that he did not know about it until a few days ago but the time frame raised questions that investigatorswillpresumablyexamine as they try to piece together who knew what and when last year duringwhat american intelligence agencies have calleda russian effort to influence the presidential election transcript how many times do i have to answer this question russia is a ruse i know you have to get up and ask a question so important russia is a ruse i have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and i did not have communications with the russians i didn t take any money from russia if that s what you re asking me did any adviser or anybody in the trump campaign have any contact with the russians who were trying to meddle in the election well of course not was there any contact in any way between trump or his associates and the kremlin or cutouts they had of course not why would there be any contacts between the campaign we have no relationship this is an absurd attempt by the clinton campaign to try to get the focus off of what the real issue is so to be clear mr trump has no financial relationships with any russian oligarchs that s what he said that s what i said that s obviously what our position is we hear experts you know his house cat at home once said that this is what s happening with the russians it s disgusting it s so phony can you say that nobody from the trump campaign had any involvement with the russians before during or after the campaign yes i can did anyone involved in the trump campaign have any contact with russians trying to meddle with the election absolutely not can he say definitively that nobody in his campaign nobody that he s been associated with had any contacts with any russian agents no first of all the answer is no and we don t know of any any contacts with russian agents the meeting with the russian lawyer came at a crucial stage inthe elder mr trump s against the odds campaign as he pivoted toward taking on mrs clinton who was widely seen as the front runner for the presidency withmr trump sparty still divided histeam was eager for information that could be used against his democratic opponent just as any nominee would be at that stage the difference was that the kremlin according to intelligence reports was eager to play a role in the campaign and was in the midst of unleashing an operation to damage mrs clinton the younger mr trump said the meeting with the russian lawyer yielded no useful information about mrs clinton and instead turned into a discussion about a russian american diplomatic dispute by happenstance or not in the days and weeksafterthe meeting with the russian lawyer emails purloined from democratic computers were made public which investigators tied to russian hacking as a candidate the eldermr trump who had expressed admiration of president vladimir v putin of russia took positions that summer that caused head scratching he expressed openness to lifting sanctions on russia that were imposed after its annexation of crimea and suggested he might not defend nato allies that did not spend enough money on their own security the republican platform at the party convention in july 2016 was crafted to keep out a call to provide arms to ukraine to fight pro russian separatists the president s legal team declined to comment about the close timing of some of these events a white house official said the president s threat to air allegations about mrs clinton on june 7 was part of a long planned speech andwasnot related to his son s decision to meet with the russian lawyer at a briefing on wednesday sarah huckabee sanders a white house spokeswoman dismissed the latestarticlesabout the emails and meeting as much ado about nothing mr trump said on wednesday that he was not aware of the june 2016 meeting with the russian lawyer at the time no that i didn t know until a couple of days ago when i heard about this he told reuters he did not fault his son for sitting down with thelawyer i think many people would have held that meeting mr trump said democrats said the timing of donald trump jr s emails andhismeeting with the lawyer showed an intent to collude going back now a lot of things seem to be falling into place said jennifer palmieri who was mrs clinton s campaign communications director she dismissed the president s assertion that hehadknownnothing about the meeting it s not plausible to me understanding how much control donald trump exerts over whatever organization he s in charge of how many times did he tell us i m in charge i m the only one who matters i m my own strategist lawyers with experience in political inquiries said the timetable would certainly interest investigators but did not necessarily mean they would find a connection you have two pieces of the puzzle and they re important said cliff sloan who was an associate independent counsel during the iran contra investigation but you have to see how all the pieces fit together before you can draw final conclusions in a speech in san diego mrs clinton castigated mr trump for his affinity for mr putin saying the republican candidate had an affection for tyrants that would make him a poor commander in chief if you don t know exactly who you re dealing with men like putin will eat your lunch she said donald trump jr received an email from rob goldstone aformer british tabloid reporterwhoknewthe trumps and spent a lot of time in russia in recent years citing a russian contact mr goldstone offered to help provide very high level and sensitive information that would incriminate hillary as part of russia and its government s support for mr trump mr trumpreplied with interest 17 minutes later if it s what you say i love it especially later in the summer he wrote after several more emails mr trump and mr goldstone agreed to a meeting at trump tower on the afternoon of june 9 with what mr goldstone described as a russian government attorney who is flying over from moscow mr trump said he would probably be joined by paul j manafort the campaign chairman and jared kushner his brother in law who would later become a white house senior adviser that evening the republican primary season wrapped up with contests in five states mr trump the presidential candidate took the stage in new york and focused on mrs clinton i am going to give a major speech on probably monday of next week and we re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the clintons he said hillary clinton turned the state department into her private hedge fund the russians the saudis the chinese all gave money to bill and hillary and got favorable treatment in return donald trump jr mr manafort and mr kushner met with natalia veselnitskaya a russianlawyerwho contrary to mr goldstone s email did not openly work for the state but was a former prosecutor with deep connections to the russian government and a history of arguing for russian interests in an initial statement to thenew yorktimes the younger mr trump said ms veselnitskaya primarily discussed a ban on american families seeking to adopt russian children imposed by mr putin as retaliation for american sanctions on russians suspected of human rights abuses donaldtrumpjr later acknowledged that he had agreed to the meeting because he believed ms veselnitskaya would provide the campaign with incriminating information about mrs clinton only after an inquiry by the times prompted him to release his emails did it become clear thathehad beentold that the information was coming from the russian government ms veselnitskaya for her part has maintained that nothing about the campaign was discussed andshesaid she provided no incriminating information about mrs clinton in an interview on fox news on tuesday night the younger mr trump saidthatms veselnitskaya s discussion was sort of nonsensical inane and garbled and that hehadconcluded the original email was probably some bait and switch to get him to take the meeting he said mr kushner left the meeting within 10 minutes while mr manafort spent most of the time looking at his phone mr trump said he did not mention the meeting to his father there was nothing to tell he said it was literally just a wasted 20 minutes which was a shame at 4 40 p m that day or roughly right after the meeting if it began at 4 p m as scheduled theelder mr trump posteda message on twitterjabbing mrs clinton about email messages that had been deleted from her private server on the grounds that they were personal and not about government business mr trump the candidate ended up not giving the major speech about mrs clinton s dealings with russia and other countries despite his promise mrs clinton s campaign spent the day waiting for the attack we were very concerned about it ms palmieri said we put a team together the campaign figured the attack would be a reprise of some of the allegations raised a year earlier in a book called clinton cash by peter schweizer so mrs clinton s advisers drafted responses and recruited surrogates to go on television to defend her then the day came and i was in the room with hillary and we re monitoring what he said and he didn t do anything ms palmieri said on wednesday the white house saidmr trump had switched speeches because of the mass shooting at an orlando fla nightclub theday before a hacker calling himself guccifer 2 0 posted opposition research and donor documents stolen from the democratic national committee a cybersecurity firm that investigated the breach concluded that russia was behind it too bad the d n c doesn t hack crooked hillary s 33 000 missing emails mr trump the candidate said in a statement the activist group wikileaks posted nearly 20 000 emails from senior democratic national committee officials intelligence officials have said that the emails were taken from the party s computer system by russian hackers the same day mr trump delivered the speech denouncing mrs clinton s ethics that hehadpromisedearlier relying mainly on clinton cash and other known controversies linked to her in an interview on cnn donald trump jr dismissed democratic suggestions that the russians were trying to hurt mrs clinton and help his father it s disgusting he said it s so phony he added i can t think of bigger lies but that exactly goes to show you what the d n c and what the clinton camp will do they will lie and do anything to win the elder mr trump publicly dared russia to hack mrs clinton s emails russia if you re listening i hope you re able to find the 30 000 emails that are missing he said i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press advisers later said he was only joking transcript i have a real problem when hillary clinton who gives open access to a phony server is allowed to get these briefings how does hillary clinton get a national security briefing when she s been probably hacked when so much of her information the director of the f b i said it was essentially negligent but it would be interesting to see i will tell you this russia if you re listening i hope you re able to find the 30 000 emails that are missing i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press i have nothing to do with russia i said that i said that putin has much better leadership qualities than obama but who doesn t know that because it s under audit i ll release them tax returns when the audit s completed nobody would release what it s under i ve had audits for 15 or 16 years every year i have a routine audit under audit when the audit is complete i ll release them but zero i mean i will tell you right now zero i ve nothing to do with russia advertisement
