advertisement supported by by maggie haberman and patrick healy in manchester n h on monday after a traditional town hall style event the candidate who prefers dashing home from speeches on his private jet stopped by the red arrow diner and ordered a cheeseburger plate piled high with french fries his debate performance thursday night was polished a clear result of some forethought and of absorbing lessons from debates at which he seemed to wing it on saturday morning he will visit a barbecue in new hampshire hosted by former senator scott p brown of massachusetts then he will speak at a tea party convention in south carolina in the afternoon until now donald j trump s campaign has broken all the rules eschewing rope lines diner visits and decorum in favor of one hour rallies twitter commentary and one provocation after another but now as some polls have tightened and voting nears mr trump is very gingerly starting to balance his unique style with running the iowa way and the new hampshire way letting his unconventional instincts accommodate certain conventions corey lewandowski mr trump s campaign manager said that his guiding principle in the campaign s early months was you don t change success you let trump be trump and that huge rallies were a perfect fit because he loves to be with other high energy people mr lewandowski who has spent years working on campaigns in new hampshire said that the trump operation was not abandoning its bigger is better approach but that there would be an increase in smaller more intimate events as mr trump makes his final pitch to voters in as many settings as possible it s the close for lack of a better term he said winners like barack obama george w bush and bill clinton spent considerable time in up close settings with voters a strategy that hillary clinton is now pursuing in hopes of persuading undecided voters the risk for mr trump is that too much baby kissing people pleasing mr nice guy politicking will come across as inauthentic to voters who like that he is in their view a tough talking realist about perceived threats from muslims illegal immigrants and budget busting democratic and republican leaders in washington republican strategists were divided about whether he could win the party s nomination without embracing retail politics this was one of the reasons romney lost in my view he just did largely rallies and stump speeches and was not seen rolling up his sleeves and talking to people where they live said greg mueller who advised patrick j buchanan when he ran in new hampshire in 1992 and 1996 trump is positioning on the issues as a populist and a nationalist he now has to connect with people where they live not just in speeches transcript na but doug gross a republican strategist in iowa said politics as usual could undercut mr trump s brand when you do conventional things you take away your shtick mr gross said vickie daniels a republican from plainfield n h who attended a trump rally in nearby claremont this month said she would be less likely to vote for him if he started sucking up to people in diners like usual candidates i love that he s not your run of the mill politician and just speaks his mind ms daniels 57 said that s his whole appeal to me donald t critchlow a historian at arizona state university and author of the coming book future right forging a new republican majority said the only candidate who had succeeded by relying on mass rallies and oratory as mr trump has was the populist william jennings bryan a young nebraska congressman who won the 1896 democratic nomination after his demagogic cross of gold speech in which he denounced the gold standard bryan lost decisively to william mckinley in the general election and mr critchlow noted bryan hung a cross of lead around the democratic party for years and it took the great depression for the democratic party to recover when mr trump flirted with running for president in 2011 he tested the waters like a typical politician he shook hands at the roundabout diner in portsmouth n h visited a manufacturing plant and attended a state party fund raiser with a congressman the strongest hint of controversy during his stroll through portsmouth came when a television at the diner broadcast an msnbc report about mr trump s birther push against president obama mr trump watched it silently then moved on and ultimately sat out the election according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president mr trump is proud of doing it differently this time he frequently notes that he has been told he has accomplished something no one else has in politics marrying social media and his celebrity to lift his political message he amplifies his views and attacks rivals several times a day on twitter with his messages often shared by thousands of people bookers for cable and sunday news shows follow his every word and frequently arrange for him to call in to their programs a v i p status that generates even more attention most politicians are expected to show up at studios for interviews but accommodations are regularly made for mr trump so he can opine from his office or home only sporadically does mr trump take questions from actual voters and even those town hall style events have an atypical feel with people shouting out questions or mr trump answering them in lightning round fashion term limits are fine medical marijuana is good he rattled off in claremont initially in the campaign mr trump spent little time shaking hands on rope lines having once described himself as a clean hands freak he adapted to the custom in the fall most of his republican rivals are campaigning the old fashioned way gov chris christie of new jersey has staked his fortunes on embracing new hampshire primary customs like town hall style meetings and private dinners with activists for days on end and has been rewarded with the endorsement of the new hampshire union leader former gov jeb bush of florida and gov john kasich of ohio are also focused on persuading voters in smaller settings though mr trump has mocked them for it usually when people do the small diners and everything is because they can t get anybody to show up to be honest with you mr trump said during his manchester diner stop according to abc news he has not completely abandoned his 2015 playbook small gatherings for mr trump might be on the scale of his event friday at living history farms a museum in urbandale iowa which attracted 250 people maybe we ll stop and get a slice of pizza at a pizza ranch mr lewandowski said earlier in the week a reference to the local chain that rick santorum used for gatherings while campaigning for the 2012 caucuses in iowa which he won narrowly over mitt romney mr trump visited one in waukee iowa still it was not quite the conventional eat and greet campaign stop his staff ejected a new york times reporter who had recently written an article raising questions about the campaign s iowa field operation other reporters were allowed in according to the associated press mr trump delivered a pep talk to campaign volunteers and announced an endorsement from pizza ranch s president and co founder adrie groeneweg the restaurant was not open to the public and mr trump did not try a slice mr gross the republican strategist said that for mr trump interacting with voters in a no rules setting would be different he s the reality tv candidate out here mr gross said it s hard to entertain people when they have fried chicken curling out of the corner of their mouths that s a dangerous move for him to transition from reality tv to politics in real time advertisement
