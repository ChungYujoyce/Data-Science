lost among the repetitive sniffing the incoherent rants about the cyber and his non canonical lackof restraint or decency on the presidential debate stage republican donald trump threatened to abandon at least two of our closest eastern allies unless they help pay for our diplomatic and military aid there were nearly too many egregious violations of every presidential debate rule to properly index all of them any one of which wouldhave ended the presidential aspirations of any previous candidate which was worse al gore walking up to george w bush and muttering dingell norwood a move that many believe cost gore the 2000 election or trump confirming that he doesn t pay federal taxes that yes he was in fact sued for refusing to rent to african american tenants that democrat candidate hillary clinton isn t presidential because she s a woman that he engaged in a five year racist crusade against the first african american president s background or that in the face of all his yelling and his used car salesman believe me guarantees he claimed to havea better temperament than clinton our system and yes 45 percent of the american voting public is so unrecognizably damaged perhaps beyond repair that this incompetent man child has made it this far and worse hasnotbeen summarily eliminated from contention following his historically epic meltdown on monday night while we re discussing trump s heretofore undisclosed health issues and his misogynistic mansplaining to a woman who s absolutely his superior in every way competence experience and yes temperament we almost overlooked trump s dangerous remarks about how he would likely abandon many of our closest international partners in peace worse clinton was forced to apologize for trump s knee jerk awfulness to at least two of those partners again clintonhad to apologize to make sure our allies recognize that we plan to honor our treaty obligations per domestic and international laws as trump said the single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament nuclear weapons not global warming like you think and your your president thinks nuclear is the single greatest threat just to go down the list we defend japan we defend germany we defend south korea we defend saudi arabia we defend countries they do not pay us but they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and we re losing a fortune that s why we re losing we re losing we lose on everything i say who makes these we lose on everything all i said that it s very possible that if they don t pay a fair share because this isn t 40 years ago where we could do what we re doing we can t defend japan a behemoth selling us cars by the million yes we defend other countries as the last remaining superpower that is what we do it s our role in the world likewise those nations provide us with bases intelligence technology and so on it s fair to saywithout these treaties therewould be many more overseas conflicts and surely ones that involve shooting nevertheless with the entire world tuning into the proceedings trump made it perfectly clear in the context of nuclear weapons no less that our allies would be left to fend for themselves unless they ponied up some cash and naturally this required the only responsible leader on the stage hillary clinton to clean up trump s mess a growing pile of harrowing threats clinton said well let me let me start by saying words matter words matter when you run for president and they really matter when you are president and i want to reassure our allies in japan and south korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them i d wager a month s salary that trump has never even uttered the phrase mutual defense treaties and that he has nounderstanding that such documents exist or that they re binding it makes sense really given that trump has abandoned thousands of subcontractors without payment despite agreements to the contrary but amid all of his otherwise career ending gaffes and blurts under normal rules that is clintonhad no choice but to interject with an apology so as to maintain solid relations with our partners on the international stage all because trump thinks honoring our treaties is a matter of personal whimsy in fact clintonwasn t just apologizing to world for trump by proxy clintonwas also apologizing for 45 percent of american voters who think this smirking twitter troll is presidential material and that it s okif we renege on our defense obligations now just imagine how trump will actually comport himself when and if he s elected imagine the unnecessary conflicts in which we d become entangled with otherwise friendly nations because trump and his gaggle of cheerleaders don t realize what s going on this is far worse than the bungling antics of george w bush trump would make enemies out of friendlies and launch shooting wars with unfriendlies and the irony is the white non college educated men who compose trump s legion of fanboys would be stationed on the front lines as designated bullet blockers in those wars for now however the overseas reaction was tentative in the philippines victor andres manhit president of the think tank albert del rosario institute for strategic and international studies welcomed clinton s assurances that the u s would honor its treaty obligations if she becomes president i m really hoping that that kind of statement reminds our own government that we have an ally in the united states vis a vis our fight for territorial integrity and our maritime rights in the south china sea he said and insouth korea cho june hyuck a foreign ministry spokesman said it would be inappropriate for the seoul government to respond to comments made by u s presidential candidates in the run up to the vote trump said during the debate that south korea should burden larger costs for the u s troops stationed in the peninsula and that the united states should let china have a larger role in controlling the actions of north korea japan sbusiness oriented nikkei asian review called clinton the clear winner headlining its lead story bullish hillary tamed trump face off in 1st tv debate in addition narushige mischishita a japanese analyst said it was in some ways heartening to hear his country mentioned in the debate since japan is often overlooked these days but he disagreed with trump s criticism that japan and other u s allies aren t contributing enough to their defense it s not a matter of whether a trump presidency would destabilize the world economy and our relations with international alliances it s how apocalyptic the destruction would be until now members of theinternational community has been following along in a cursory way not unlike swing voters but now that they re getting a glimpse of the two contenders side by side the contrast couldn t be more striking and if trump ends up winning we re in for a long cold four years of unpredictable mayhem on a global scale trump has tolose this election and last night s debate gave us and the world countless new reasons why bob cesca is a regular contributor to
