Hillary Clinton announced on Saturday that she would introduce a constitutional amendment within the first 30 days of her presidency to overturn the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, which paved the way for unlimited corporate, union and individual spending on elections.

Clinton unveiled her plan in a video at Netroots, an annual progressive gathering taking place this year in St. Louis.

Clinton has also pledged to issue an executive order to require government contractors to disclose campaign contributions, and has said she would push the Securities and Exchange Commission to require all publicly traded companies to disclose political contributions to their stockholders.

As The Huffington Post’s Paul Blumenthal noted in September, campaign finance reform is notoriously difficult to pass, since politicians are loath to support anything that makes it more difficult for them to win elections. An amendment must be approved by a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate and then ratified by three-quarters of the states.
