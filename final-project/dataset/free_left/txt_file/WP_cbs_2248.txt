but as fear grows globally and president trump calls america s multibillion dollar who contribution into question politics are bound to dominate and no one will be immune end vt elizabeth palmer it s been a tense week in british politics as prime minister boris johnson was admitted to intensive care with coronavirus but in a bit of easter good news we ve just heard in the last few minutes that he s actually been discharged from the hospital and is going off to his country residence to recuperate margaret margaret brennan that is liz palmer in london thank you we turn now to new jersey governor phil murphy he joins us this morning from red bank governor good morning to you we heard from doctor fauci on another network cnn this morning that there could be a rolling reopening of the u s economy by next month is new jersey ready for that governor phil murphy d new jersey govmurphy margaret good to be with you and happy easter boy i ll be the happiest guy in new jersey if not america if we are but i do know one thing any sort of an economic reopening or recovery depends first and foremost on a complete health care recovery getting that sequencing right i think based on the data and the the facts that we re seeing is incredibly essential and that if we either transpose those steps or we we start to get back on our feet too soon i fear based on the data we re looking at that we could be throwing gasoline on the fire so the pain is awful we get that in terms of unemployment small businesses but i i based on how we see this evolving i m all for an economic recovery but it s got to be on the back of a of a full health care recovery margaret brennan sounds like you re saying not so soon you said yesterday at a press conference that your state is literally on edge when it comes to the supply of ventilators that you need right now have you asked the white house for more governor phil murphy we have and and i have to say that the white house over the past number of weeks has delivered a series of tranches of ventilators and other personal protective equipment but we continue to be shy on all all fronts and we are constantly and persistently not just asking the white house from this federal stockpile for more support but also turning over every stone in new jersey around the country and frankly around the world margaret brennan you have a call with the white house tomorrow scheduled is that your chief request governor phil murphy yeah it would be at the top of the list ventilators i think would be number one and ppe again is something that we are constantly on the prowl for we have these calls which are very helpful by the way at least once a week but as you can imagine we re on with the administration every single day margaret brennan right governor phil murphy morning through night having bilateral conversations on this stuff as well margaret brennan doctor birx spoke from the white house podium this week and said that more than ninety percent of abbott coronavirus tests delivered to labs haven t been used i know your state is one of those that has been chosen to use some of these tests from abbott labs do you know why there is such a backlog governor phil murphy i don t know i mean i know that all the testing companies both private sector as well as public have big backlogs and and i i don t know the specifics on abbott we were very happy that abbott picked new jersey as one of its first states particularly in bergen county which which is the county which had this virus has hit the hardest and we re we re hoping that the backlogs we we can pass through as fast as possible and expand the testing as as quickly as possible we re i think we re in the fifth most tests of any state in america but we still need more margaret brennan the the national association of governors released a bipartisan letter yesterday calling for about five hundred billion dollars in unrestricted aid for states and and asking congress to give that money why is the money that the federal reserve has made have made available why is that not enough governor phil murphy let s add both margaret this is not one in lieu of the other the the fed s steps are important and we hope to take our steps to take advantage of them but that s no replacing direct cash on the barrel to states assistance from the federal government either from the cares act from a couple of weeks ago or from any other steps that will be taken i support completely the nga s ask of five hundred billion dollars in fact governor cuomo in new york governor lamont in connecticut and governor wolf in pennsylvania and i a few weeks ago said we our four states alone think we need a hundred billion dollars of direct cash assistance so it s both that as well as the steps taken by the fed we re going to need all of the above margaret brennan you know every expert we talk to tells us that in order for any state any part of this country to reopen there needs to be a plan in place for surveillance that means testing and that means tracing you sit right between new york and another hotspot in philadelphia you re right in that corridor what is the regional strategy what is your strategy to start to do that kind of surveillance governor phil murphy yeah so you you you use the exact right word regional we re the densest state in america but we sit across the hudson from new york and across the delaware from philly we ve got to do this in concert with our neighbors and it s frankly it s still early stage partly because the house is still on fire and job number one is to put the fire out in the house but we have begun a rather intense this weekend discussions with our neighboring states on the whole question of testing contact tracing what are the rules of the road going to be for things like bars and restaurants to make sure we don t have unintended consequences on one side of the river versus the other there are a whole series of steps in health care infrastructure that we need to take i was on the phone with one of your guests this morning a new jersey guy scott gottlieb on this very topic a couple of days ago so we re early stage but you re absolutely right we need to have a regional approach we can t do this alone margaret brennan and we will be talking to doctor gottlieb shortly thank you governor for your time this morning good luck to you and chicago is one of many cities that has seen a disproportionately high number of coronavirus cases within its minority community and we go now to the mayor of chicago lori lightfoot mayor thank you for joining us this morning lori lightfoot mayor of chicago chicagosmayor it s my pleasure to be here margaret brennan mayor the data you shared this week frankly shocked a lot of people around this country seventy two percent of your city s deaths have been among black chicagoans according to your office lori lightfoot yes margaret brennan even though they make up just thirty percent of the city s population why is this having such a heavy toll in the black community lori lightfoot well this is an issue that s not unique to chicago unfortunately we re seeing similar kinds of numbers reported across the country in large urban centers and the answer that we believe is right is because of the underlying conditions that people of color and particularly black folks suffer from whether it s diabetes heart disease upper respiratory illnesses the kind of things that we ve been talking about for a long time that plague black chicago that lead to life expectancy gaps this virus attacks those underlying conditions with a vengeance just this morning i learned of a man that i know well african american had an underlying condition and went very quickly as a result of the coronavirus so it is devastating our community margaret brennan what you said got the attention of the white house as well as the surgeon general said from the podium that black americans are not biologically or genetically predisposed this is socially predisposed because of pre existing health issues lori lightfoot right margaret brennan he rattled off a number of other factors the point being this is so layered in complexity how do you as a mayor start chipping away at this lori lightfoot well you start by making sure that you ve got the data one of the first things that we did is made sure that we issued an order to require all providers who were doing testing not to skip providing demographic information we need to be able to accurately understand the impact of this virus so that s one get the data share the data and then what we also put in place was a racial equity rapid response team so this is a team of healthcare providers public health clinicians as well as stakeholders in the community faith community block clubs we have street intervention folks who normally work on responding to violence we are going all in in a hyper local focus to make sure that we are tapping into those neighborhoods where there s a high death rate where there s a high positive test rate and we are bringing people into healthcare systems and making those kind of connections that may not have otherwise existed but that s the kind of hyper local focus along with some other measures that we re doing to disabuse people of the myth that was circulating up until recently that black people actually couldn t get coronavirus margaret brennan one of the other stats that stood out is that so many essential workers frontline workers lori lightfoot yes margaret brennan are people of color lori lightfoot that s right margaret brennan so when it comes to that factor whose responsibility is it to provide protective equipment is it that individual s employer is it the mayor like you lori lightfoot well i margaret brennan is it the federal government lori lightfoot look i think it starts with the the employer we re calling these people to work we have a responsibility to make sure that they re taken care of so for the employers that we are in contact with whether it s our our city employees or sanitation workers whether it s the public transportation workers who are out there every day we re making sure that they have the equipment that they need masks gloves and training and then we re doing things about the places that they gather lunchrooms and other places to decontaminate them clean them on a regular basis but also make sure that we re educating them about why congregating even those seemingly innocuous places can be a significant problem on our bus lines we ve added additional buses so that people who are dependent upon public transportation can ride in safety and making sure that we are doing everything we can to educate people about the danger of this disease and emphasizing hand washing if you ve got an underlying condition staying at home margaret brennan mm hm lori lightfoot and making sure that you re isolating yourself within your home from other people who have to go out and work every day margaret brennan doctor fauci said this morning there could be a rolling reopening of the economy by may do you plan to open up chicago by next month lori lightfoot well i i heard the comments of governor murphy and i think he s got it a hundred percent right we cannot open up the economy until we make sure that we ve got all the healthcare controls in place that means widespread testing contact tracing and we ve got to see not just a flattening of the curve but a bending down we re we re trending in the right direction here in chicago we started out seeing that cases were doubling every one to two days then every three to four we re now on a trend of nine to ten but we ve got to see a lot more progress on the healthcare front before we can even start talking about reopening the economy margaret brennan mayor thank you and good luck to you lori lightfoot thanks so much i appreciate your time margaret brennan we will be back in a minute with former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb stay with us announcements margaret brennan former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb has been helping us on face the nation educate our viewers since we began devoting our broadcast to covid 19 coverage and he joins us from his home in connecticut once again this morning thank you for your help doctor i want to ask both the governor and the mayor said before they even consider what doctor fauci said which is a rolling reopening in in their areas that they need surveillance they need testing they need things that they say they do not have in place right now who s leading that effort whose job is that scott gottlieb m d former fda commissioner scottgottliebmd well unfortunately i think it s going to be the states leading the effort i the feds are going to backstop the states but the feds are pretty tapped out as well and and didn t have a lot of resources to put against this to give you sort of a basis for comparison you re going to be hearing testing tracing treating as sort of the mantra going forward and the tracing part of that that s actually doing contact tracing when you identify people who have the infection you want to trace who their contacts are to give you sort of a reference in wuhan in china they had eighteen hundred teams of five people each doing contact tracing at the height of that epidemic so about nine thousand people right now cdc has about six hundred people deployed across the country the states are supplementing that but the states need to increase their resources now the feds are going to have a hard time pulsing their resources in the throes of this crisis and so i think it s going to be up to the states and a lot of it s going to be on to governors in massachusetts you saw baker make a move to hire one thousand people to do that contact tracing work other governors are going to have to follow that lead margaret brennan well difference between china and the united states is protection of civil liberties here so how do you do something like surveillance which is an uncomfortable world word for a lot of people here is it something like an app like apple and google proposed this week scott gottlieb well that app that s a platform that that google and apple are are fashioning it s basically like a pipeline for public health authorities in states or localities to try to use if they want to do electronic contact tracing and i think a lot of people are going to be concerned about that but remember contact tracing is sort of the bread and butter of public health work we do this when we have outbreaks of multi drug resistant tuberculosis or measles where when you identify people who have an infection you want to identify people who they were in contact with isolate them and get them tested as well that s how you can control outbreaks i think one of the concerns that we need to address right now is what happens when you identify someone who has the infection you re going to want them to self isolate for a period of time while they re infectious but people may be reluctant to do that and they may be reluctant to have governments enforce that self isolation say you have to stay at home for two weeks and so i think businesses need to think about how they provide compensation basically paid leave for people who are forced to self isolate because they have the infection and the government might actually want to pay those people to give them an incentive to step forward because if it s seen as punitive if it s seen that when you get covid 19 you re going to be forced to self isolate for two weeks you re going to miss work and you re going to be out of money then people aren t going to want to step forward margaret brennan yeah scott gottlieb and get diagnosed and you don t want to create a disincentive to diagnosis margaret brennan doctor stay with us i have to take a commercial break here but i ll be back in a moment with you and stay with us announcements margaret brennan there was big news this week on the democratic presidential campaign front vermont senator bernie sanders suspended his campaign all but assuring former vice president joe biden of the nomination we look forward to getting back to the presidential campaign and politics just as soon as our country can announcements margaret brennan we ll be right back with more from former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb and later we ll hear from the university of washington s christopher murray and minneapolis fed president neel kashkari plus stay tuned until the end of the broadcast for the archbishop of new york cardinal timothy dolan announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we want to pick up where we left off with former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb we were talking about the projection by doctor fauci that you could have a rolling reopening of the economy by next month what parts of this country have the systems in place or the ability to open up that soon scott gottlieb well look i don t think anyone s optimized really right now we re not going to have the testing in place we re not going to have the public health employees hired to do the effective contact tracing so you know there s no question we re going to be opening at some at some risk i think that s inevitable there s a lot of pressure right now from the business community on not just the administration but governors as well to start reopening the economy so i think inevitably we re going to see a slow reopening of business activities through may with some risk but there s always going to be risk and if you ask public health officials like me what the optimal amount of testing is the answer we ll give is more but we re not going to be where we want to be so i think you re going to see a gradual reopening where businesses where governors and mayors say well businesses can reopen but you can only bring back fifty percent of your employees that are on any one shift so you force the employers to break up the shifts maybe you tell people over the age of sixty five to stay home a little longer you tell businesses you can t have meetings more than ten people you can t have conferences so there ll be measures put in place to try to limit interactions at the workplace but allow some work to get on margaret brennan the fda has said it it may approve a serology test that s the the test for the antibodies in your blood in sometime in the next few weeks what does that do to your timeline and how widely available would that be scott gottlieb well it may be widely available but i think it s of marginal utility and impact for these kinds of discussions what serology tells you is if you have circulating antibodies in your blood if you ve been exposed to the virus and you ve developed some level of immunity but i think when we actually do serology on the population we re going to find the actual level of exposure across the population is very low somewhere between maybe two or five percent and i d put on the low end of that range that s certainly the modeling the data coming out of europe where they have anywhere from two to five percent of their populations exposed if you look in certain professions healthcare workers police people who work on grocery checkout lines flight attendants tsa agents people who come in contact with a lot of people as part of their work the rates may be higher maybe on the order of ten percent that have been exposed and developed some immunity so you can make decisions in those professions to preferentially return certain people or put certain people on the frontlines right away but on the whole we re going to find that a very small percentage of this population certainly in the single digits have actually been exposed to this infection so the perception that there s thirty or forty percent margaret brennan mm hm scott gottlieb that have been exposed and developed immunity it s not going to be the case margaret brennan we know that this is a global pandemic the president has said that he is reviewing u s funding to the world health organization the u s gives about a hundred million a year to it they re leading the response around the world what changes do you think need to be made scott gottlieb well look i don t think this is a time to defund at who given the fact that i think this is going to become epidemic in the southern hemisphere in parts of the world that don t have resources to deal with with this kind of a global issue but the president raised a lot of valid concerns china was not truthful with the world at the outset of this had they been more truthful with the world which would have enabled them to be more truthful with themselves they might have actually been able to contain this entirely and there is some growing evidence to suggest that as late as january 20th they were still saying that there was no human to human transmission and the who was validating those claims on january 14th sort of enabling the obfuscation from china i think going forward the who needs to commit to an after action report that specifically examines what china did or didn t tell the world and how that stymied the global response to this i also think they need to embrace taiwan s role in the global health community and allow them to attend the world health assembly right now they ve frozen china out the who has at sort of the behest of china and that s hampered the global response because china s been a very important partner to give you just one more anecdote china didn t share the viral strains margaret brennan right scott gottlieb and the who should have made them do that had they shared those early on we could have developed a diagnostic test earlier validated earlier margaret brennan well we will see what the president decides to do in the coming days doctor gottlieb as always thank you for your time scott gottlieb thanks a lot margaret brennan one of the models that the white house is watching closely in terms of hospital resources and what the death toll could look like going forward is from the university of washington s institute for health metrics and evaluation you often hear it referred to as the ihme model the director is doctor christopher murray and he joins us this morning from seattle doctor murray good to have you here what would a rolling reopening of the economy look like and what would that do to your projections christopher murray m d director institute for health metrics and evaluation university of washington ihme uw well we ve been trying to investigate that because i think there the issue is if you open up too soon and there is a big load of cases still in the community that have the potential to go back to community transmission we can quickly see resurgences in some states so some states it s possible in may but in other states it s going to be very you know very unlikely that that would not lead to an immediate resurgence margaret brennan which states are safe to reopen christopher murray well what what we re seeing is that the states such as out here on the west coast seem to be farther along the epidemic peaking and then we need multiple weeks of closures after that peak to bring the burden of cases down to the point where testing and contact tracing has a has a chance of working and then of course there s the big issue if states are on different time timings of their epidemics which we know is the case how are they going to control importation from other states into their state so it poses a whole series of new questions that haven t yet really been addressed margaret brennan you know this week your model projected that around sixty one thousand americans will lose their life to the virus by the end of this summer that is a a breathtaking number but it is far lower than your april 2nd estimate of nearly a hundred thousand your discrepancy there has been heavily criticized i d like you to explain why there was such a significant change christopher murray well about two weeks ago our first prediction was about eighty thousand cases with a very wide range from about thirty thousand to a hundred and fifty thousand and all of our subsequent forecasts have been within that range what the the advantage of the model that we run which is we keep updating it you know three four times a week is that it s driven by the data and so the trend up in some states has been faster in new york for example at the beginning that pushed our forecasts up and then the trend the peaks that we re seeing in california and washington have been lower than expected and that s brought these forecasts down a bit but they ve all been within the same range we re now the last series of forecasts have been around sixty sixty one thousand deaths we predicted the peak about now and that seems to be occurring at the national level but because of the incomplete implementation of social distancing closures in many states it s adding a degree of uncertainty about what s actually going to happen in places like texas as an example margaret brennan texas is a hot spot that worries you still christopher murray well all the places where we have only partial closures for example on the essential business list those are the ones that it s really much harder to know what s going to happen margaret brennan okay christopher murray we have rock solid evidence that the full closures work we ve seen that in italy and spain we re seeing that out here out west but what we don t know is do these sort of incomplete closures have the same impact margaret brennan you know doctor fauci likes to say that that a model is only as good as the assumptions you put into it i believe your models assume that social restrictions stay in place until the end of may so if you start reopening parts of the country how high of risk of rebound is there christopher murray if the the first testing we ve done on this is if you opened up the entire country may 1st then we would very clearly have a rebound we don t think the cap capability in the states exists yet to deal with that volume of cases and so by july or august we could be back in the same situation we are now i think what doctor fauci was talking about this morning is that different states are on different timings margaret brennan yeah christopher murray and so maybe some states can open up mid may but we have to be very careful and make sure that we don t sort of lose all the effort that the american people have put into closures margaret brennan mm hm christopher murray by premature opening margaret brennan and this is a global pandemic this could be a seasonal virus where are we as a world right now christopher murray well that s the really big question most of our work at the institute is actually focused on tracking health around the world in a thing called the global burden of disease so we re we re used to looking at all the data around the world and the big worry is what will be the toll in places in low and middle income world that don t have the capability perhaps of implementing social distancing measures they don t have the icu capacity they don t have the ventilator capacity to deal with patients and that s what i think many people are trying to focus their attention on now what s coming down the pike margaret brennan doctor thank you for your analysis we will be right back announcements margaret brennan we turn now to neel kashkari president and ceo of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis he also led the treasury department s 2008 tarp program he joins us from minneapolis thank you for joining us clearly you know what a crisis is like and how to navigate one i want to ask you about the jobs crisis right now because sixteen million americans have filed for unemployment since these restrictions went into place due to the virus the st louis fed says we could see forty seven million americans losing their jobs where is your prediction of a bottom neel kashkari president and ceo federal reserve bank of minneapolis neelkashkari well we just don t know i ve been listening to your program this morning margaret and we just don t know the path of the virus that s going to determine how long the shutdown needs to take place and ultimately how many americans lose their jobs and how quickly we can get them back to work when the economy turns back on so there are a wide range of estimates of how wide or how high the unemployment rate is going to go but it s all driven by the virus and how effective we are in the health care system is to catching up and to controlling it margaret brennan so these estimates or predictions of a v shaped economy that the economy is just going to turn right back on when people go back to work is overly optimistic neel kashkari i think so i i you know it d be wonderful if some new therapy were developed in the next couple of months that people could have confidence to go back to work that they could get treatment then potentially we would have a v shaped recovery but borrowing some barring some health care miracle like that it seems like we re going to have various phases of rolling flare ups as we heard from your guest from washington different parts of the economy turning back on maybe turning back off again this could be a long hard road that we have ahead of us until we get to either an effective therapy or a vaccine it s hard for me to see a v shaped recovery under that scenario margaret brennan well it looks like congress and the administration underestimated the amount of pain small business owners are in there are predictions that the three hundred and fifty billion put aside could be exhausted and that s why congress is talking about adding another two hundred and fifty billion they re fighting about it at least what will the impact be if congress doesn t make that package bigger this week neel kashkari well i think it s very important a a lot of small businesses are saying they want to keep their business together they want to keep their employees employed which is really really important so that we don t have even more job losses so that s good the banks are trying to step in the small businesses are trying to do their part but we know that the three hundred and fifty billion dollars is not going to meet the needs across all the small businesses in america so it will end up being first come first serve who end up getting the assistance and who s left on the sidelines i m optimistic i think congress will come together to provide more support to small businesses but then again we don t know how if this support is going to be long enough because if we need to have different phases of shutdowns for the next several months or until we have a therapy or vaccine they re going to need more help than that margaret brennan right and and the fed is part of this strategy because as we ve detailed this week there are about 2 3 trillion dollars in loans that the federal reserve that you re part of could issue to businesses to states and to local governments you said in in the last crisis that the mistake was going sort of too small and being too timid this time around is there enough money being thrown at this problem neel kashkari i think there is in terms of what the fed can do i think our chairman is being very very aggressive he s learned from our experience in 2008 and the whole federal reserve is being as aggressive as possible that s the right thing to do i think congress is also being very aggressive but again it goes back to the progression of the virus if we re going to have economic distress until we have a vaccine then it s going to be up to congress to keep coming back to provide support to the american people we can t shut down the economy for eighteen months but we need to find ways of getting the people who are healthy who are at lower risk back to work and then providing the assistance to those who are most at risk who are going to need to be quarantined or isolated for the foreseeable future that s a real challenge for all of us margaret brennan your colleague james bullard of the st louis fed was with us last week and he said that the answer lies fully in technology it s testing and surveillance getting people before they walk into their employer to have a test and wear a badge i mean is that your your guidance here too neel kashkari oh i would love it if that were possible i ve talked to some healthcare experts who who say that it s a fantasy that we re going to be able to test tens of millions of people every day that there simply is not the equipment there s not the supply chain i hope they re wrong that s a real concern i don t think we should put all of our eggs only in the mass testing basket we should try to make that work we should also invest fully in vaccines fully in therapies but then i think we re going to need to be smart about how we start to reopen parts of the economy with those who are at lowest risk until that capacity and that testing and those vaccines and therapies come online i think we need an all of the above approach because we don t know where we re going to have the breakthrough margaret brennan many americans this month had to suspend their mortgage payments they just couldn t pay because of what their reality is and i know jay powell the head of the federal reserve has said they re watching carefully the mortgage servicers what is the degree of risk here that we are looking at some kind of housing crisis financial crisis neel kashkari well we know that ultimately if this goes on long enough these losses roll up into the banking sector people don t pay their mortgage coffee shop doesn t pay their landlord the landlord then can t pay the bank s mortgage and so it ends up rolling up into the banking sector right now the banks are well capitalized relative to where they were in 2006 but if this goes on long enough it could pro produce strains in the banking sector and then the fed and congress and treasury would have to step in to make sure that the banks are sound so it s something i think we re all watching very closely margaret brennan when you say long enough what is the timeline that you re worried about neel kashkari i m i m focusing on eighteen months because we re looking around the world as they relax the economic controls the virus flares back up again and that makes intuitive sense because so many people have the disease but they don t show any symptoms so you don t know who s spreading the disease and who isn t so we could have these waves of flare ups controls flare ups and controls until we actually get a therapy or a vaccine i think we should all be focusing on an eighteen month strategy for our health care system and our economy if it ends up being shorter than that that s great we should prepare for the worst case scenario margaret brennan all right neel kashkari thank you for your insights we ll be back in a moment announcements margaret brennan the easter and passover holidays are a little different this year for a look at how some americans are finding solace in faith we go to the archbishop of new york cardinal timothy dolan cardinal thank you for joining us cardinal timothy dolan archbishop of new york cardinaldolan margaret a blessed easter to you and your listeners margaret brennan thank you this is easter week it is passover it will soon be ramadan as well how would you counsel people to observe their faith while in isolation timothy dolan well you use the word faith and that s key faith of course doesn t depend on things physical and we have faith these days that even though we can t sadly get to the synagogue or or to our parish churches we can still be in union with god through prayer through sincerity through earnestness through charity to others and thanks be to god so many are using the technological advances that that we have live streaming radio tv you name it people are are plugging in it at overwhelming numbers to be part of a community at easter and passover margaret brennan you are the archbishop there as we said of of new york that means that your diocese you are administering to the people right at the epicenter of this outbreak there and i think one of the most painful things that i can think of is all those families who cannot hold funeral services hold all the rituals for the people they just lost we saw those pictures from new york of mass graves these are things you see in war zones you don t see in the richest country in the world how do you grieve without that that ritual surrounding death timothy dolan it s it s difficult just as you have faith that the person you love is still enjoying eternal life and is still with you so our faith needs to kick in that even if we can t be next to mom and dad or grandma and grandpa and even if we can t embrace the family at a time of mourning our faith tells us we re still united we re still together i ve experienced it myself margaret i ve i ve had to bury a number of priests and and people at graveside and i say to them you know your grief is complicated because not only if you lost someone you cherish you were even unable to be next to them in their last moments and you re unev unable even to to mourn and cry and hug one another here at graveside this is this is an extended enhanced deepened sense of grief which i hope whenever we got that loss whenever we got that emptiness you know who wants to fill it god so i m hoping it s an invitation from him that as we re empty he will fill margaret brennan pope francis gave an interview recently and he said about the virus it s it s a time for integrity what does that mean from a social justice perspective what is he asking timothy dolan sure you margaret brennan people to do timothy dolan you know integrity means a connectiveness that what we believe deep down inside is mirrored in the way we act okay that s integrity the opposite of integrity is disintegration when our life falls apart because there s a a division there s a a fracturing between the inside and the out the holy father s asking us to integrity you see it you see it when people discover an interior strength and they re telling me that margaret they re saying these days i m alone in my apartment i m missing all the things i usually count on and yet i ve discovered deep down within a a resilience strength and virtue and talent i didn t know i had i m discovering the warmth and tenderness and love that i have for family and friends even though i can t be with them and they ll tell me i m even rediscovering a faith that had grown somewhat dormant as i m sensing god s presence and and talking to him and and feeling his consolation that s an integrity when things come together and when that flows out to the way we love and treat other people as we see so radiantly all over in our health care workers in our first responders and in neighbors who are looking out for one another shopping checking on one another i think we ve got an integrity a connectiveness a unity of purpose and i am rather confident that s what pope francis meant margaret brennan there still is no vaccine to stop this virus even when we get through the worst of it how are you going to reopen church doors are you going to keep the social distancing and for someone this morning who wants to get in their car and go to any denomination to to to worship what would you tell them before they make that decision timothy dolan well we ve god gave us common sense and god told us we have to pay attention to the common good the decision that i would make about opening our churches and please god it s as soon as as can be is that we have to listen to the experts we have to listen to the physicians the scientists we have to listen to our civic officials because they re on top of things and and we re people of common sense god gave god gave us a brain and part of the way he answers prayers is in the direction the guidance the illumination that we get from other people when they tell us we can go back and when those medical experts offer some ways that perhaps at least until we re sure this virus is behind us we can protect one another that ll be the time to go and that s what i say to to god s people who today are really missing they want to get in the car and drive around until they find a church open god is telling us use your brain use your prudence use your common sense don t tempt the lord margaret brennan cardinal dolan thank you happy easter timothy dolan thank
