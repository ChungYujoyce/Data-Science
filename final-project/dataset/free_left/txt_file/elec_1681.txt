phoenix republican presidential nominee donald trump declared saturday that the silent majority is back as he predicted victory in a presidential race roiled by new questions of democrat hillary clinton s legal jeopardy over her use of a private email system trump seized on fbi director james b comey s announcement friday that he is at least temporarily continuing an inquiry he had previously declared closed democrats frantically demanded answers about the scope of comey s additional inquiry and questioned the timing and motives of his announcement as you ve heard it was just announced yesterday that the fbi is reopening their investigation into the criminal conduct and the illegal conduct of hillary clinton trump said that was a broad overstatement comey recommended in july that clinton not be charged in the case and his letter to congress on friday said that it is unknown if the emails now being reviewed are significant justice warned fbi that comey s decision wasn t consistent with policy but the crowd at the trump rally roared hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal difficulties he said her criminal action was willful deliberate intentional and purposeful he continued hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure and exposure he said knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk trump floated his own theories shifting focus away from his own controversies in the hope of scoring a last minute surge in an race that even his staff admits he has been losing he said the only explanation for the fbi move is that very very serious things must have been found the clinton email probe questions and answers trump stuck closely to a theme that has held resonance throughout the long presidential campaign the idea that the nation s political system is corrupt and weighted toward those who already have power and money hillary clinton s corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation and it must be stopped he said he invoked the history of scandal or controversy attached to clinton and her husband former president bill clinton haven t we had enough drama with the clintons he asked as he did earlier in the day in golden colo trump congratulated himself for suggesting that former u s congressman anthony weiner s connection to clinton could trip her up i had no idea it was going to be that accurate he said according to two people familiar with the situation the newly discovered emails were found on a computer seized during an investigation of former u s congressman anthony weiner weiner is separated from his wife top clinton aide huma abedin before trump took the stage carl mueller whose daughter kayla mueller a captive of the islamic state who was killed in syria spoke at the rally in his support at one point during trump s remarks a man in the back off the crowd tuned toward the press who were working in a dedicated area at the rear of the venue and loudly chanted jew s a the crowd also cheered maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio whose hard line stance on illegal immigration has made him a folk hero for some and a symbol of racism or intolerance for others and former republican governor jan brewer when hillary s lips are moving what is she doing brewer called as the crowd shouted back lying amid chants of lock her up brewer went on the bombshell that was dropped yesterday looks like she was just too reckless even for fbi director comey brewer said mispronouncing the name hillary thinks arizona is in play in november and arizona will turn from a red state to a blue state brewer said as the crowd began to boo don t boo vote brewer said laughing it s a line also used frequently by clinton and first lady michelle obama democrats see arizona as an opportunity to expand the map of battleground states this year owing largely to trump s high unpopularity with women and hispanic voters or at least to force him to spend money and time defending the state clinton will campaign in phoenix on wednesday earlier saturday clinton demanded answers about what she suggested is a politically motivated renewal of the previously shuttered federal inquiry into her email with just days to go in the presidential election it s pretty strange to put something like that out with so little information right before an election clinton said as a supportive crowd cheered her on and booed the mention of comey s name other democrats went much further issuing scathing assessments of comey s motives and timing the assault signaled a decision to go fully on offense against comey and confront the email issue and republican attacks head on the congressional black and hispanic caucuses organized a news conference to denounce comey at least three democratic senators drafted a letter of complaint saturday and the democratic national committee issued a tartly worded statement by releasing a letter within sixty days of the presidential election comey broke with long standing department tradition that is meant to prevent any influence on the electoral process the dnc statement said the letter did not offer enough detail that would allow americans a full understanding of the development and whether or not it is even significant which has led to speculation on the part of the media and irresponsible claims by republican leaders the fbi must move quickly to release additional clarifying information podesta sent an email message to supporters saturday night summarizing the development and asking for solidarity and for donations by being vague and obfuscating comey opened the door to conspiracy theories republican attacks against hillary and a surge of fundraising podesta wrote there is no evidence of wrongdoing no charge of wrongdoing and no indication that any of this even involves hillary polls had begun to tighten even before the fbi development and it is unclear what effect it will have clinton closed her day with what had been designed as a celebratory concert in miami featuring supporters jennifer lopez and marc anthony rain dampened the event which included no mention of the email development from clinton or the performers just remember how low our opponents go we go high clinton exclaimed no matter what they throw as us we don t back down not now not ever only 2 points separate clinton trump in latest tracking poll in his letter comey said the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information comey said it is unknown if the information may be significant in fact it s not just strange it s unprecedented and it s deeply troubling clinton said saturday we call on director comey to explain everything right away and put it all out on the table jenna johnson contributed to this report jenna johnson contributed to
