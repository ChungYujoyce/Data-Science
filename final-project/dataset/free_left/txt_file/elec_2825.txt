remarkably stable just look at the national nbc wsj poll numbers since sept 2015 but does that stability change after fbi director james comey s bombshell friday that his organization learned of the existence of new emails that appear pertinent to its previous investigation into clinton s email practices one the one hand the polling we ve seen so far suggests that voters remain in their partisan corners according to this weekend s washington post abc poll 63 of voters said the fbi s review makes no difference and among the 34 who say it makes them less likely to back clinton those voters are disproportionately republicans and gop leaning independents what s more the post comey polls we ve seen here and here haven t really budged at least not yet on the other hand it has never been a positive for clinton throughout this entire presidential race when the focus has been on her especially on the subject of emails eight days to go the latest developments in the comey surprise meanwhile here are all of the latest developments in the comey surprise the fbi obtained a warrant to search emails related to the probe of hillary clinton s private server that were discovered on ex congressman anthony weiner s laptop also on sunday senate minority leader harry reid accused comey of violating the hatch act which bars government officials from using their authority to influence elections former attorney general eric holder wrote a scathing op ed condemning fbi director james comey for his handling of the investigation into hillary clinton s use of a private email server i fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the justice department and the fbi and nbc s ari melber has a piece concluding that newly discovered emails even if they contain classified information would unlikely change the earlier conclusion not to charge clinton this site is protected by recaptchaprivacy policy terms of service fbi s review of the emails could be quick additionally nbc s pete williams reports that it s possible the fbi s review of the emails could end quickly now that the fbi obtained a warrant to search them they ll narrow them down to look at just those dating from the time hillary clinton was secretary of state then they ll weed out any that are not about government business agents will use automated software to search what s left for duplicates they ve already found during the investigation of the clinton e mail server any that remain will be checked for classified information williams reported on today this morning officials say there s no way to tell how long that will take but they say if it goes quickly and nothing classified is found the fbi could say so within the next few days it largely depends on how many of the e mails are duplicates and how many are new to the investigators nbc wsj marist polls clinton up in nc deadlocked race in fl over the weekend we released brand new nbc wsj marist polls of florida and

washington post piece into trump s charitable giving or lack thereof for as long as he has been rich and famous donald trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous he spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public even nationally televised promises to give his own money away it was in large part a facade a months long investigation by the washington post has not been able to verify many of trump s boasts about his philanthropy instead throughout his life in the spotlight whether as a businessman television star or presidential candidate the post found that trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other people s giving as his own how violence and retaliation are constant themes in trump s rhetoric also do read nbc s benjy sarlin on how violence and retaliation are common themes in trump s rhetoric and in his events in his eyes the world is an unforgiving place where cities are war zones where rapists are streaming across the border and where jealous rivals are hatching plots to humiliate america and trump personally to prevail in such an environment he suggests the response to any slight must be swift and overwhelming dwelling on limits imposed by law or tradition is usually a secondary concern this framework has expressed itself in policy in which trump has extolled the use of torture threatened reprisals against the families of terrorists and pledged to jail clinton a former senator and secretary of state it has expressed itself rhetorically in vicious insults against critics and in his encouragement of violence by supporters first read s downballot race of the day florida senate marco rubio rode to republicans rescue when he reversed his pledge not
