 the politico caucus a growing number of republicans think he can defeat hillary clinton but they worry his campaign s ground game is a disaster by steven shepard 09 09 2016 05 09 am edt despite donald trump s improving prospects gop insiders express little confidence in his campaign s infrastructure getty once resigned to a november defeat swing state republicans are increasingly optimistic about donald trump s chances now that the gop presidential nominee has closed a once yawning deficit in the polls against hillary clinton that s according to the politico caucus a panel of activists operatives and strategists in 11 battleground states 10 of which president barack obama carried in 2012 while a majority of gop insiders still say clinton would carry their state if the election were held today significantly more republicans now say trump would win than even just a few weeks ago advertisement but despite trump s improving prospects gop insiders express little confidence in the trump campaign s infrastructure particularly compared with how democrats feel about clinton s campaign still the uptick in how republicans view trump s chances is striking in this week s survey 61 percent of gop insiders said clinton would win their state but the 39 percent who picked trump to win is a new high water mark for the gop nominee it s a measure the politico caucus tracks on a weekly basis and for most of august only about one in five republican insiders thought trump would win their state trump has turned the tide in ohio and he would win by a microscopic margin if the race were held today said a republican there all respondents completed the survey anonymously the political landscape has changed in the past few weeks in colorado as well as the nation added a republican there reluctant republicans are realizing the choice is ideological angry bernie supporters just can t support hillary because of what the dnc leaks exposed and independents are indicating many will also throw support for trump in colorado because hillary is so toxic an iowa republican added hillary has spent millions here she s pounded on him for months unopposed and unrelenting and she s still behind she s functionally the incumbent and she has little to no room for growth in short she hasn t put him away she probably can t put him away so he wins still many republicans still think clinton s organizational advantage will prevail tightening numbers make the ground game even more important said a new hampshire republican and without a trump ground game he can t win here gop insiders are mostly downcast about the state of trump s organization only 17 percent said they have a lot of confidence in the trump campaign infrastructure in their state while 39 percent have only some confidence in the campaign and 44 percent have no confidence at all democrats are much more confident about clinton s campaign 82 percent said they have a lot of confidence much more than the 17 percent who express only some confidence and 1 percent who have no confidence at all anecdotes from the field about the trump ground game amount to the stuff of nightmares for national republicans a colorado republican the most visible manifestation of trump s campaign in jefferson county colorado is a small office in a low rent building that also happens to feature a psychic and a massage parlor add to that the constant robocalls and trump s colorado effort has the look and feel of a county commissioner campaign a florida republican said trump was operating the weakest republican campaign in the state since well i ve only been working here 30 years and cannot think of one worse a michigan republican the trump campaign hired a number of staff but they are all from out of state a new hampshire republican are you telling me there is a trump infrastructure in new hampshire i have more confidence in the red sox bullpen than i do in the trump infrastructure a north carolina republican asked simply what infrastructure an ohio republican they have a pro at the top in state director bob paduchik but he has a staff of c players right now they are putting a premium on yard sign locations vs an actual get out the vote effort a pennsylvania republican they seem to have signs out and about so i suppose they have something in place a virginia republican republican officials tell me they are having a hard time getting trump signs and the locals have to pay for them so far i have seen no walk around literature which we had at this point in 2008 and 2012 there were a couple of bright spots however the trump campaign infrastructure is in better shape in iowa than in other states said a republican there primarily because of the establishment support he has attracted there however the campaign is still far behind the clinton effort in terms of staff and resources on the ground it may not matter though because a drive through rural iowa reveals a far greater level of organic support for trump than for clinton added an ohio republican bob paduchik knows ohio very well and he s an elite political operative with few peers if he s given the resources he can help trump win ohio for democrats clinton s more developed and sophisticated organization is a panacea at a time when the polls are tightening in addition to the strong ratings insiders gave her campaign the vast majority of democrats 94 percent said she would win their state if the election were held today though that s down from a range of 98 percent to 100 percent in the past five weeks just here in hamilton county we have five hillary offices three dozen paid field staff and hundreds of engaged volunteers said an ohio democrat trump does not have a single office a north carolina democrat called it the best i have ever seen here better than obama in 2008 or 2012 even so some democrats are less satisfied with clinton s organization it is good but it isn t anywhere close to obama said a florida democrat this is a young talented team but only knows what brooklyn tells them added an iowa democrat they aren t spending enough to cancel how low her numbers are in the state and one new hampshire democrat recalled clinton s landslide loss to bernie sanders in the first in the nation primary the infrastructure is good but is the candidate the democrat asked bernie blew the same team clinton out of the water in february infrastructure can only go so far with a flawed candidate these are the members of the politico caucus not all of whom participated in this special survey colorado ryan call
