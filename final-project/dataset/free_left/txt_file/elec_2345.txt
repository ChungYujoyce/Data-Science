if you want a glimpse into a presidential candidate s governing style take a look at his campaign how does he build an organization how does he manage personnel how does he delegate responsibility does he value loyalty or honesty in advisers it s hardly conclusive but how a candidate deals with these challenges says a lot about what they d prioritize as president enter donald trump the presumptive republican nominee has managed his campaign the way he manages his casinos or his realty tv program haphazardly and with an unearned arrogance everything s about the brand and non sycophants are cast aside getting it right is far less important than being right thus when prompted by advisers todial down the rhetoric and think more about his long term viability trump has resisted he s yet to understand how different a primary and a general election are and he s too cocksure to listen to anyone who tries to explain it trump isn t as stupid as he pretends to be but his confidence seems to scale with his ignorance and that s a dangerous trait in a president given how consequential each decision can be as a candidate a confident idiot can make a lot of noise and fool a lot of voters but you can t lead that way as president trump would need the sober advice of serious professionals considering how little he understands about the job and the world this is especially true in his case based on the latest behind the scenes reports on trump s campaign as well as his entire history in real estate and television it s unlikely he would govern with the humility and self awareness required the campaign has undergone several shake ups in recent months with key staffers like corey lewandowski being demoted to make way for veteran operatives like paul manafort trump s approach has remained very much the same however everyone he brings in bends to his will or is replaced by someone who does things have gotten more chaotic in the last week or so as rick wiley was fired as the campaign s national political director wiley was known to assert himself in ways that alienated trump and his loyalists the washington post s sean sullivan and robert costa summarized the broader situationover the weekend for the last two months donald trump has presided over a political team riddled with turf wars staff reshuffling and dueling power centers but tensions are more than typical campaign chaos they illustrate how trump likes to run an organization whether it s a real estate venture or his presidential bid interviews with current and former trump associates reveal an executive who is fond of promoting rivalries among subordinates wary of delegating major decisions scornful of convention and fiercely insistent on a culture of loyalty around him these are the management techniques of a brand hustling magnate not a president of the united states trump s dictatorial approach works well on the campaign trail but it d be a disaster in office a president has to persuade and compromise the capacity to admit ignorance is equally important trump by all accounts has no interest in any of these things trump doesn t know what he needs to know in order to be president nor does he care that he doesn t know if his campaign is any indication he ll hire people to ensure his veil of ignorance is never cracked that kind of megalomania is why trump is who he is it s part of his outsized persona it s also the clearest indicator we have of the kind of president he d be sean illing is a usaf veteran who previously taught philosophy and politics at loyola and lsu he is currently salon s politics writer follow him on facebook and twitter read his blog here email at silling salon com copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
