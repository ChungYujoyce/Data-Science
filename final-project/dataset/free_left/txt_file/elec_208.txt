advertisement supported by 5 photos view slide show by amy chozick and jonathan martin hillary rodham clinton who had set out to use the second democratic presidential debate to portray herself as the strongest potential commander in chief while france reeled from terror attacks instead found herself pummeled by rivals on saturday over her ties to wall street and her foreign policy record the debate in des moines opened with mrs clinton senator bernie sanders of vermont and martin o malley bowing their heads to observe a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the attacks in paris on friday and at least at first the three remaining democratic candidates seemed acutely aware that traditional political punches could seem petty in the aftermath of the bloodshed but then mr sanders and mr o malley unleashed pointed yet polite critiques of mrs clinton s foreign policy stances including her 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in iraq which mr sanders tied to the rise of the islamic state which officials in paris have said was responsible for the attacks let me have one area of disagreement with the secretary mr sanders said gingerly as if on eggshells to lob an attack at a somber moment i would argue that the disastrous invasion of iraq something that i strongly opposed has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al qaeda and isis mr o malley meanwhile painted a dark portrait of middle east policy under the obama administration in which mrs clinton spent four years as secretary of state libya is now a mess syria is a mess iraq is a mess afghanistan is a mess he said without directly calling her opponents na ve mrs clinton responded by listing decades of granular foreign policy developments that she said contributed to the current crisis if we re ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in iraq she said but she grew increasingly defensive as the evening progressed and the topics drifted to domestic issues mr sanders and mr o malley both criticized her ties to the financial industry and argued that her policies would not go far enough to rein in the wall street excesses that led to the 2008 financial crisis let s not be na ve about it an increasingly animated mr sanders said why over her political career has wall street been the major campaign contributor to hillary clinton now maybe they re dumb and they don t know what they re going to get but i don t think so we checked the accuracy of candidates remarks live in the democratic debate in des moines mrs clinton called the implication an attack on her character and won applause by noting that the majority of her donors were women who made small dollar donations he has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity let s be frank here she said she seemed to link her contributions from the financial industry to the aftermath of the sept 11 terrorist attacks noting that she spent considerable time as a senator from new york working to rebuild lower manhattan where many banks are an argument that left some viewers perplexed later in the debate when a voter asked via twitter what working to rebuild new york had to do with receiving contributions from financial institutions mrs clinton sought to clarify her remarks i m sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression she said the attacks on mrs clinton were notably harsher than in the first democratic debate last month an illustration of the growing pressure her two rivals feel to differentiate themselves as she tightens her hold on the democratic race mr sanders tried repeatedly to return the conversation to income inequality an area where he has galvanized voters with his populist message he drew brief laughter when he said he was not sure yet exactly how much he would increase taxes on the rich but he promised not to raise rates as high as the 90 percent level that existed during the presidency of dwight d eisenhower a republican mrs clinton meanwhile focused her opening statement on national security all the other issues we want to deal with depend on us being secure and strong she said according to a new york times cbs news poll released on thursday 53 percent of democrats said they were very confident in the former secretary of state s ability to handle an international crisis compared with 16 percent who said the same about mr sanders but with mrs clinton s experience also came pitfalls which were on stark display onstage at the 775 seat sheslow auditorium at drake university in des moines on saturday where a young woman outside held a poster that depicted a peace symbol with the eiffel tower in the center mrs clinton has further solidified her support among democrats after her testimony before a congressional committee investigating the 2012 attack on the american diplomatic mission in benghazi libya but the testimony highlighted wider questions about mrs clinton s tenure at the state department namely her insistence that the white house join a nato led coalition to oust col muammar el qaddafi a move that is widely seen as contributing to the chaos and instability in the region asked if he had any disagreements with her record as secretary of state mr sanders said i am not a great fan of regime change mr o malley who stood out in saturday s debate with only three candidates competing for airtime also assailed mrs clinton s push to intervene in libya we need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of nation state failures and conflict he said it s not just about getting rid of a single dictator mrs clinton defended her decision to back the ouster of colonel qaddafi who she said probably had more blood on his hands of americans than anybody when the discussion shifted to gun control mr sanders became the subject of attacks and he appeared better equipped to defend himself on the issue than he had in the first debate after mrs clinton suggested last month that he was using sexist language in the first democratic debate in las vegas on oct 13 when he said that shouting would not resolve the issue mr sanders slyly calibrated his language the problem is people all over this country not you secretary clinton are shouting at each other he said about guns and what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus mr sanders arrived in des moines under pressure from some of his backers to deliver crisper lines of attack against mrs clinton the most recent new york times cbs survey showed that 52 percent of likely democratic voters are backing mrs clinton compared with 33 percent for mr sanders and she has extended her lead in polls in iowa and closed in on mr sanders in new hampshire the first states to vote in the democratic contest but even as he portrayed mrs clinton as wavering and untrustworthy on liberal issues she looked beyond the primary and sought to improve her standing among general election voters an abc news washington post poll released this month showed 51 percent of voters have an unfavorable opinion of mrs clinton while a cbs news poll released in october showed 61 percent of registered voters did not trust mrs clinton in calling out mr sanders for what she said are impractical proposals mrs clinton reiterated the sentiment if not the exact phrasing of a refrain that resonated in the first debate i m a progressive who likes to get things done she said then mrs clinton mocked his proposal to offer free college tuition for all saying i don t think taxpayers should be paying to send donald trump s kids to college and suggested that his health care plan would hand over too much power to states mr o malley sought to portray mrs clinton as a flip flopper on gun control secretary clinton you ve been on three sides of this he said when you ran in 2000 you said that we needed federal robust regulations then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as annie oakley and saying that we don t need those regulations on the federal level and now you come back around here mrs clinton tried to brush off attacks you ve heard a lot about me in this debate she said in closing and i m going to keep talking and thinking about all of you but there were some topics that mr sanders and mr o malley would not broach in the first debate mr sanders said the american people were sick and tired of hearing about mrs clinton s damn emails a sentiment he reiterated on saturday while his criticism of mrs clinton for her ties to banks was stinging mr sanders demurred again from attacking her over her use of a private email server as secretary of state despite recent comments he made implying he considered the issue a valid one we ve gotten off hillary s emails good let s go to the major issues facing america said mr sanders mrs clinton in response said i agree completely drawing laughs from the crowd i couldn t have said it better myself advertisement
