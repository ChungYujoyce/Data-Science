senator tim scott r s c is calling on the trump administration to monitor the impact of the coronavirus on communities of color appearing on cbs this morning monday scott expressed the importance of better outreach by the federal government to minority communities about the coronavirus i think it s really important for us to use all resources at our disposal to make sure that churches small businesses community centers are all engaged in this fight to reduce the spread of the coronavirus across america certainly and specifically in the african american community the senator said african americans represent about one third of all hospitalizations but only about 13 of the nation s population and you ll find on most of the frontlines in the grocery stores some of the takeout services you ll see a lot of african americans working and so what we want to make sure that we understand is that if you have a higher incidence of high blood pressure and asthma it s really important for you to take the necessary precautions from wearing masks washing hands all the protocols this is uniquely targeting the african american community the strategy to make sure that we are fully prepared to undertake protocols that will save more lives than we have today scott described the disparities that are occurring among coronavirus cases and fatalities as they affect the african american community in south carolina for example approximately 37 of those infected are black though they make up only 27 of the population in michigan the senator said they account for 41 of the fatalities but only 14 of the population in louisiana 70 of the fatalities and less than 30 of the population and in mississippi over half of those infected and about 31 of the population we re seeing a higher incidence and i think with this outreach we can reduce that or flatten the curve in the african american community and it will help the nation as a whole scott said co host anthony mason asked only a handful of states actually collect data on these racial disparities what do you think a federal tracking system might do to help doctors well aggregating the information from the federal level will be very helpful scott replied we re doing it in south carolina i spoke with my governor he s on the game he s on spot the data would help us to provide the type of information so that our health care workers are as protected as possible my mother spent over 45 years as a nurse s aide in a hospital scott said so making sure that the frontline folks are taken care of is really important one of the challenges that we have going forward is if we don t reduce the incidence of covid 19 among our health care workers then who s going to take care of us the most important thing we can do is protect that frontline by putting a shield between them and their patients the fastest way to do that is to have fewer patients the way you do that is by following the protocols and the masks are very important i talked to dr fauci about that specifically a couple weeks ago and he said without question masks help you not spread to your loved ones scott said so when you re talking with your grandmother or when you re visiting your father it helps co host gayle king asked the president as you know is pushing to reopen the country on may 1 dr fauci has said listen we re on the virus timeline not the other way around it seems like health experts don t believe that this is the right move i m wondering what you re seeing in your state of south carolina does it seem like the right move to you to loosen social distancing may 1 scott replied what i ve seen is a lot of flexibility from the administration as it relates to what that date was the date was april 15 but the experts said that was premature we saw it kicked to april 30 and as the information continues to be collected i think you ll see perhaps another shift if necessary scott said that in south carolina there have been more than 2 500 covid 19 cases with approximately 80 deaths i think we are handling it pretty well we have some hot spots that we re concerned with but here s what we have to do the containment strategy was effective the mitigation strategy is now flattening the curve but for us to go back to work and for parents to send their kids back to schools we re going to need an abundance of testing the finger prick test in my opinion is what we should be focused on making sure that we know who s had coronavirus and also being able to have tests on demand without that certainty i think everyone s going to be challenged as we head into the end of april saying what we should do without an abundance of testing especially the tests that tells us who s had it scott is also the author of the new book opportunity knocks how hard work community and business can improve lives and end poverty center street which chronicles his childhood struggles in poverty mason asked what advice would you have for anybody right now for anyone struggling out there hope springs eternal the senator replied one of the lessons of the book that you ll learn in opportunity knocks is i ve had health care challenges i unfortunately fell asleep driving a car down the interstate at 70 miles per hour and went through the windshield broke my ankle ruined my senior football season but i found faith as a result of that i failed in business but found success after that i ve lost campaigns but even in the aftermath of the campaign losses opportunity knocked again and i had an opportunity to get back in politics and to finally become a united states senator i have had failure failure failure and it always seems that there s a silver lining that success follows failure like night follows day it s been a blessing and i hope my story provides hope during these challenging times because the one thing i m completely confident of is the best is yet to come for this nation and for most of us in this nation we have very bright futures to look forward to for more info david morgan is a senior editor at cbsnews com and cbssundaymorning com watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream
