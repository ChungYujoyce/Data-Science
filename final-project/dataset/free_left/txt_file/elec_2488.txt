it s important to reckon with the role sexism played in the 2020 democratic primary many women are left feeling defeated after elizabeth warren s exit from the presidential race with a crushing loss on super tuesday and voter after voter quoted in the media saying they d vote for a woman just not warren it made some wonder if a woman would be president in their lifetimes warren spoke about the bind women candidates face while talking with reporters thursday afternoon gender in this race you know that is the trap question for every woman warren said standing outside her home in cambridge massachusetts after announcing she would be suspending her campaign thursday if you say yeah there was sexism in this race everyone says whiner and if you say there was no sexism about a bazillion women think what planet do you live on for the second time in four years an exceptionally qualified female candidate lost to her male counterparts some objectively far less qualified warren s loss was not as sudden or shocking as hillary clinton s in 2016 but what stung for many was the depth of voters rejection so much so that warren came in third in her home state of massachusetts on super tuesday i can t stress to you how tired i am of answering the same questions pulitzer prize winning columnist connie schultz told vox in an interview thursday after publishing an essay on warren s loss we ve just asked for one chance for a woman to lead the country just once let s try a woman sexism was a big factor in warren s loss though it was far from the only one the specter of president donald trump and democrats obsession with finding the most electable candidate to beat him loomed over everything in the primary it also relied on long held assumptions about what a successful candidate looks like i am so disappointed with voters in this country i wonder if a woman could win new hampshire voter chris hurley a self described progressive woman told vox in january i hate to say that it may be a white middle aged man we ve got to beat trump warren certainly made missteps during the campaign but america apparently isn t ready for a woman president at least not yet one of the hardest parts of this is all the pinky promises and all those little girls who are going to have to wait for four more years warren said thursday her voice cracking slightly there s no doubt sexism played a major role in the way women running for president were treated throughout the primary candidates including warren were questioned for their likability their ambition and their ability to win in ways men simply were not echoing long held double standards that still exist for women candidates biases about both gender and race likely intersected on myriad other fronts as well for instance a july poll of likely new hampshire voters found good favorability numbers for both warren and then candidate sen kamala harris 67 percent for warren 54 percent for harris but dismal likability ratings for them just 4 percent of likely voters thought warren was likable and 5 percent for harris compared to that 20 percent of likely voters thought biden and sanders were likable related while 38 year old former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg was rarely questioned about his ambition running for the highest office in the land after governing a city of fewer than 102 000 people massachusetts residents registered their displeasure with warren for her presidential bid before it even started an october 2018 suffolk university poll of massachusetts voters found just 17 percent thought warren should run for president compared to 68 percent who said no about 10 weeks before she announced her candidacy warren s favorability ratings in the state were decent but not many wanted her to try for the presidency that could be viewed as massachusetts voters not wanting to lose warren but it could also be seen as disliking a woman s ambition it s another version of know your place we ve already given you this thing how dare you aspire to more schultz said i don t see that message telegraphed to men there should be no guilt about being ambitious women running for president also needed to prove their qualifications more than the men they were up against it s one thing for voters to support a woman as part of a deliberative body like a legislature as a decision maker but in order for her to be the decision maker voters have to be that much more convinced she s qualified says amanda hunter a communications and policy director at the barbara lee foundation women candidates were more than aware of this expectation tailoring their speeches and rollouts to highlight their experience policy bona fides and track record of winning every office i ve run for no one like me had ever done the job harris said in an interview with nbc news based on gender based on race every time pundits said the people weren t ready for it but i won warren too got so many questions about this subject that her campaign signage was tailored to emphasize how she could win clinton s shocking 2016 defeat elicited voters fears that a woman couldn t beat trump again in 2020 even though women candidates had won in droves during the 2018 midterms when it comes to the difference between the midterms and today i think voters are terrified of anything that looks or feels similar to 2016 said democratic strategist meredith kelly the former communications director for sen kirsten gillibrand s presidential campaign as well as for the democratic congressional campaign committee in 2018 and because of that almost blinding fear i think female candidates were at a particular disadvantage in the race to take on trump male candidates have the benefit of being judged by their potential for greatness and women have to bring receipts kelly added prejudices about women could well have translated to voters decision making a study from yougov s sam luks and tufts university s brian schaffner released in july 2019 found democratic primary voters who scored higher on a hostile sexism scale were less likely to choose either warren or harris as their top choice for the primary when polled luks and schaffner established this scale by asking voters a battery of questions about their attitudes on gender a panel developed by social psychologists peter glick and susan fiske voters were asked to agree or disagree with statements like most women fail to appreciate fully all that men do for them and women seek to gain power by getting control over men luks and schaffner concluded that dealing with such sexism was an obstacle that women candidates in the democratic primary continued to face with a subset of voters though they added that voters pushing back against sexism could flock to the democratic party during the general election and boost a woman candidate in an updated survey released this week schaffner and data for progress co founder jon green polled voters before the iowa caucuses and found the same trend voters who had more sexist attitudes were less likely to support warren questions related to candidates gender were abundant during the primary particularly on the issue of electability throughout the race women candidates had to answer questions over and over again about electability even though none of the most prominent women had ever lost an election before when people say it shouldn t be a woman this time because a woman lost last time well men have been losing the presidency for hundreds of years hunter told vox it is ultimately difficult to pinpoint just how big a factor sexism was during the 2020 primary and whether it was the factor that hurt women candidates chances gender broadly speaking is always interacting with and influencing factors that are important to a candidate s success or defeat says kelly dittmar a political science professor at rutgers university and scholar at the center for american women and politics for the five women who have so far dropped out of the 2020 race there are 20 men who also exited the democratic field was massive from the get go and male candidates of color like sen cory booker and juli n castro struggled to find their footing before ending their campaigns as well just like the men running in 2020 the women all had individual strengths and weaknesses that respectively bolstered and impeded their bids warren for example established herself as an effective and detailed policy wonk who has a plan for everything but she peaked early in the polls and was bogged down at times by the rollout of her health care proposal and her use of a dna test to try to prove native american ancestry she wasn t the only one harris was known for being a charismatic leader who struggled with a consistent message and had to reckon with a sometimes contradictory record on criminal justice reform sen amy klobuchar d mn who came in a surprisingly close third in the new hampshire primary was dogged by early allegations of staff mistreatment despite hammering a message of being electable in midwestern states that clinton lost and rattling off a long list of legislative accomplishments in the senate klobuchar also bowed out gillibrand d ny a candidate focused on women s issues could not shake blowback from the democratic base and donors alike for her role in the ouster of former sen al franken d mn for his alleged sexual harassment male candidates have faced electability questions too there were plenty of concerns about biden s spate of gaffes and the trump administration s intense interest in his son s ties to a ukrainian energy company so much interest it led to trump s impeachment there are lingering concerns about bernie sanders s october heart attack or whether his ideological agenda is too risky for the general election but these things were ultimately easier for primary voters to accept than almost all the women candidates when the republican opponent is donald trump the electability argument was so frustrating and is so frustrating schultz said this narrative had the force of a storm in terms of you re battening down the hatches instead of throwing the windows open wide to see what the possibilities are one of the most disheartening takeaways from the recent developments in the 2020 race is the feeling that progress around gender equity in politics has remained stagnant columnist jessica valenti said as much in a medium post last night my nine year old daughter came over to me because i looked upset when i told her i was sad because i felt like i would never see a woman be president she told me well you ll see at least one me i want her to be able to hold on to that optimism because the truth is that i m fresh out of hope to give her while it is undeniably and devastatingly true that the united states has still yet to elect a woman president there is progress taking place in the us congress that is building up an even larger bench of women lawmakers to keep pursuing higher office in 2018 democrats efforts to retake the house were driven heavily by women candidates of the 41 seats that democrats flipped from red to blue during the midterms 23 were won by women many of them in purple districts in states like iowa and michigan both senate pickups the party had in arizona and nevada were also won by women on top of that four out of seven gubernatorial flips were won by women including in michigan kansas and maine i think that people are forgetting the lessons of 2018 rep katherine clark vice chair of the house democratic caucus and a surrogate for warren told vox in a january interview when people are scared which they are they kind of look for what they ve always known as the safe choice it s worth noting too that after clinton s run in 2016 there were a groundbreaking number of women vying for the democratic nomination this cycle who helped further normalize the idea of running for president it s also true that for whoever emerges as the nominee there will be incredible pressure to pick a woman for the vice presidential spot as errin haines writes for the 19th female activists have ramped up their focus on the no 2 slot and called on biden and sanders to prioritize choosing a woman for the role as more women run for office at different levels across the country a number that spiked dramatically in 2018 more will be in position to run for executive office down the line and candidates willingness to call out sexism though it can be seen as hurting the chances of women candidates in the future also enables people to confront the problem head on the more that women push these institutions the more that we see sexism playing a less pervasive role says dittmar
