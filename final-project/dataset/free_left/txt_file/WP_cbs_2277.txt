watch cbsn live by melissa quinn april 20 2020 12 50 pm cbs news washington governors facing rising pressure to begin reviving economies that were brought to a halt because of the coronavirus pandemic are finding themselves at odds with president trump who asserts the country s testing capacity is sufficient for them to begin easing restrictions on businesses and activities mr trump and vice president mike pence spent the weekend defending the number of tests being conducted with the president saying the onus is on governors to increase testing states not the federal government should be doing the testing but we will work with the governors and get it done this is easy compared to the fast production of thousands of complex ventilators mr trump tweeted monday claiming do nothing democrats spent the month of march raising concerns about ventilators for patients battling covid 19 the disease caused by the coronavirus testing testing testing again playing a very dangerous political game states not the federal government should be doing the testing but we will work with the governors and get it done this is easy compared to the fast production of thousands of complex ventilators but governors say that a major hurdle to opening up their states again is a lack of testing supplies such as swabs and chemical reagents that has prevented them from boosting their testing capacity as well as an inadequate national testing strategy a shortage of tests is the number one problem in america and has been from the beginning of this crisis maryland governor larry hogan a republican told cnn in an interview sunday the administration i think is trying to ramp up testing they are doing some things with respect to private labs hogan said but to try to push this off to say that the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing somehow we aren t doing our job is just absolutely false governors he added have been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests from the federal government and private labs in the u s and worldwide hogan was able to secure 500 000 coronavirus tests from south korea his spokesman mike ricci saidmonday ohio governor mike dewine a republican told nbc s meet the press on sunday he could double maybe even triple testing in ohio virtually overnight if the food and drug administration fda would help the state with securing reagents we have a shortage worldwide shortage of some of the materials that go into this so we really need help he said if anybody in the fda is watching this would really take our capacity up literally chuck overnight massachusetts governor charlie baker a republican also called on the federal government to step in i certainly believe that the more guidance and especially the ability to put the foot on the accelerator with respect to advancements in testing everything associated with testing ultimately has to be approved by the centers for disease control and the fda he said on face the nation mr trump s assertions that there was enough testing in the u s to allow states to begin loosening restrictions was rebuffed as delusional by virginia governor ralph northam a democrat who said his state has been fighting to secure personal protective equipment and other supplies as part of its response to the coronavirus epidemic we ve been fighting for testing it s not a straightforward test he told cnn we don t even have enough swabs believe it or not and we re ramping that up but for the national level to say that we have what we need and really to have no guidance to the state levels is just irresponsible because we re not there yet public health experts say mass testing is a key condition for gradually reopening the u s economy while staving off another outbreak and the trump administration seems to acknowledge the role it can play with helping states secure necessary supplies for test kits mr trump on sunday told reporters at the white house that he is planning to invoke his authority under the defense production act to compel an unnamed u s company to produce 20 million more testing swabs per month pence was also set to hold a call with governors monday to review what more they can do and do together to develop locally tailored testing strategies the president said the u s is currently conducting 150 000 tests daily and has done 4 million tests overall pence said and he urged governors to activate all labs in their states to ramp up testing but dr anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases said that while the government is conducting roughly 1 5 to 2 million tests weekly that level needs to double or triple we need a partnership between the federal government and the local people including the governors to help them get to things that they maybe not have any access to he said first published on april 20 2020 12 50 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in
