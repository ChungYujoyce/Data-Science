the following is a transcript of an interview with san francisco mayor london breed that aired sunday april 26 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan we go now to san francisco the first metro area to issue a shelter in place order that city now on day 41 and the order may be extended past early may we re joined now by mayor london breed good morning to you mayor san francisco mayor london breed good morning margaret brennan as we said san francisco acted first we also know you have also since mandated masks being worn i m wondering what is it that you are seeing that other leaders around the country have not mayor breed well i i think the biggest challenge we have is we need to make sure that we are looking at the facts and the data from our public health experts so that we can make good decisions to protect public health the challenges that we face still around ppe around testing kits is just absolutely insane we have known that this crisis was coming to our country for a long time now and the fact that as of april we re still having the same conversations about the challenges i know that most cities are seeing the same data i m seeing that if we do absolutely nothing it gets worse and so that s really why we have been really a lot more aggressive maybe than than other areas because we wanted to make sure that it doesn t when you think about san francisco we have the university of california san francisco we have a number of other hospitals and the fact is if we did absolutely nothing and there was a surge we wouldn t have enough hospital beds enough icu rooms enough ventilators to serve the population if we did absolutely nothing which should alarm any mayor in any city margaret brennan you ve said you have a hard time getting protective gear and i ve read that some of that was diverted to to china who s seizing this why do i have a hard time getting it mayor breed well there was a shipment that was on its way that we had purchased that was actually diverted from china to france we fema has the ability to confiscate some of the ppe at the border which has occurred it s been very difficult and then sometimes getting things through customs or needing to use a ship rather than a plane and so we have been resourceful we are lucky to have incredible people like marc benioff who has really helped to work with ucsf university of california san francisco to get ppe and to bring it to the hospital and we ve shared our resources with one another but the fact is this should be a federal coordinated effort margaret brennan yeah mayor breed we should not still be having these conversations which is a big reason why we have to put these shelter in place orders because we don t have the resources that we need to keep people safe especially around testing margaret brennan you know one of the things we learned this week was that the cdc had confirmed that the first death from covid 19 was actually far earlier and in a different place than had been previously reported it was actually in the bay area february 6th where a woman passed away what does that tell you what do you know about how long this virus was actually circulating in your area mayor breed well it gives us an indication i know that the governor has asked to do more testing of people who passed away during earlier periods before we had cases in order to determine whether or not they were covid positive in fact one of our first cases of someone who passed away who we declared is someone who passed away from covid actually passed away from a heart attack and once we found out that their mom who was in the same household was diagnosed with covid 19 we went back and tested this individual and discovered that they had it as well so i think that it had been in the community for some time but again the lack of testing and resources available made it difficult to really get the facts around who was actually who had actually contracted covid 19 before we started to announce the numbers margaret brennan there is a lot of travel from asia into your region of the country how much did the president s ban on travel from china benefit and how much did it hurt that there wasn t a simultaneous one with europe that you had to wait for that mayor breed well i m not necessarily certain if that had an impact because i will say that we were already focused on trying to prepare for what we expected would happen in san francisco we have been monitoring this situation since december of last year we set in place a declaration of emergency back in february we operated our emergency operations center because of those relationships between people who live in san francisco and their relatives and their friends in various parts of china and we had experience sadly a lot of xenophobia against our chinese community early on i mean basically chinatown was a ghost town in the month of january and so we had been keeping an eye on this and making adjustments in order to prepare our city for what we knew was actually coming here and margaret brennan ok mayor breed and i m not certain really what the yes so margaret brennan ok thank you very much mayor for joining
