advertisement supported by by sheryl gay stolberg and alan blinder louisville ky matt bevin a republican political novice wealthy louisville businessman and tea party favorite was elected kentucky s next governor on tuesday and swept fellow republicans into statewide office with him the stunning victory heralds a new era in a state where democrats have held the governor s mansion for all but four of the last 44 years in beating his democratic opponent attorney general jack conway by almost nine percentage points mr bevin 48 shocked people in his own party who believed that the climate in kentucky was ripe for a republican but feared that mr bevin a charismatic conservative with a go it alone style was too far out of the mainstream and too inexperienced to win but in a year when outsiders like donald j trump and ben carson have captured the attention of voters in the republican presidential race mr bevin s tendency to thumb his nose at the political establishment coupled with president obama s deep unpopularity here helped him upend kentucky s political status quo i m proud of the fact that this is a great night for republicans in kentucky and more importantly a great night for conservatives in kentucky mr bevin told cheering supporters who gathered at the galt house hotel overlooking the ohio river but he added quickly we have a lot of work to do mr conway a 46 year old lawyer and two term attorney general who has been in politics much of his adult life conceded shortly before 9 p m looking subdued as he addressed fellow democrats in downtown frankfort the state capital to the people of kentucky he said i respect your decision of the six statewide offices in kentucky republicans currently hold one tuesday s results mean they will hold four and mr bevin s running mate jenean hampton will make history as kentucky s first african american to hold statewide office in one sign of how bad the night was for kentucky democrats state auditor adam edelen seen by many as a rising star and a possible 2016 challenger to senator rand paul lost his bid for re election however andy beshear the democratic candidate for attorney general and son of the incumbent governor won his race and secretary of state alison lundergan grimes a democrat who last year unsuccessfully challenged mitch mcconnell the senate s republican leader was re elected the kentucky state board of elections said late tuesday that mr bevin had won 52 5 percent of the vote with mr conway taking 43 8 percent of the vote an independent candidate drew about 4 percent of the vote statewide it was a big night for republicans turnout matters and other things you need to know mr bevin burst onto the political scene last year when he tried and failed to knock off mr mcconnell the state s most powerful republican in a primary then in may he squeaked past three republican opponents to win the primary for governor by just 83 votes his critics complained he never unified the party and heading into election day nonpartisan analysts gave the edge to mr conway but he is an aggressive retail campaigner and in recent weeks traveled kentucky in a 2001 chevrolet suburban with more than 200 000 miles on it on tuesday he turned up at two chick fil a restaurants here in louisville shaking hands in a last minute bid for votes for democrats more than the governorship was at stake kentucky is the last state in the south where democrats hold a legislative chamber the kentucky house and without the governor s mansion their hold on that chamber is in danger this changes the dynamics state senator robert stivers a republican and the senate president said instead of having one leg of the stool we now have two legs of the stool and the third leg is very weak later mr stivers and mr bevin appeared together onstage after mr bevin s victory speech leading supporters in a chant of flip the house flip the house heading into election day republicans fretted that mr bevin was frittering away an opportunity but bill stone a former chairman of the republican party in jefferson county which includes louisville said many analysts had underestimated how reviled mr obama and the democrats are in kentucky mr obama s health care law was an especially contentious issue in the race and some see the bevin victory as a rebuke to gov steve beshear a democrat who expanded medicaid under the measure an estimated 420 000 kentuckians nearly 10 percent of the state s population now have coverage as a result mr bevin a fierce opponent of the health care law at first said he would reverse it but has since softened his position and said he would stop enrolling new people but would not take coverage from those who had it kentucky s shifting political winds were evident on tuesday at the shelby county fairgrounds where voters in shelbyville a small city east of louisville that bills itself as the american saddlebred capital of the world were casting their ballots sharon hackworth 66 a retired elementary school teacher and former local democratic party chairwoman whose husband also a democrat spent 13 years as shelbyville s mayor emerged from the polling place having voted for mr conway and promptly ran into friends who are republicans our state and our county are in transition she said michelle zimmerman a 43 year old nurse said she voted democratic in the last two governor s races but had voted for mr bevin this time she found his views more in keeping with her values i m pretty conservative she said one factor in her decision she and her husband say they can no longer afford their health insurance because the premiums have gone up since the affordable care act went into effect the race pitted two candidates against each other who are as different in political philosophy as they are in personal style the hard charging mr bevin who calls himself a self made man disdains what he refers to as the welfare state he held strong appeal to both fiscal and christian conservatives when kim davis the rowan county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples was jailed mr bevin made a show of visiting her mr conway finishing his second term as attorney general is a familiar figure to voters in kentucky where he has until now run an equal number of winning and losing campaigns he ran for the house and lost to anne northup in 2000 was elected attorney general in 2007 lost his 2010 senate bid to senator paul and was re elected attorney general in 2011 the son of a prominent lawyer in louisville mr conway hews mostly to traditional democratic positions he favors increasing the minimum wage mr bevin is opposed is a strong backer of unions mr bevin favored right to work laws that would limit union organizing and made early childhood education a centerpiece of his election campaign mr bevin emphasized school vouchers in mississippi which held the country s only other election for governor on tuesday gov phil bryant was easily elected to another term and renewed the republican party s grip on power there he defeated a truck driver robert gray who barely provided token opposition in the campaign s closing weeks mr bryant and other republicans focused much of their attention toward picking up seats in the legislature and defeating a ballot initiative about public education spending there was not ever even a pulse that this race would be competitive said marvin p king jr a political scientist at the university of mississippi in virginia republicans successfully resisted a democratic effort to retake power in the state senate more than a year after a resignation allowed republicans to seize control they had little room for error democrats would have been able to claim a majority with a net gain of just one seat because virginia s lieutenant governor who casts tiebreaking votes is a democrat in other races a former united states attorney joseph h hogsett was elected mayor of indianapolis in a victory that will transfer control of the mayor s office to democrats mr hogsett who raced to an early lead over chuck brewer a businessman will succeed gregory a ballard a republican who chose not to seek a third term leading the indiana capital democrats retained the mayor s office in philadelphia where jim kenney a former member of the city council was elected mr kenney s victory in the heavily democratic city was widely expected after he captured his party s nomination in may he will succeed michael a nutter who was barred from seeking re election because of term limits jennifer roberts a democrat will become the fifth mayor of charlotte n c since 2013 after she defeated edwin b peacock iii a republican on tuesday ms roberts s victory keeps the mayor s office in democratic hands the incumbent daniel g clodfelter lost to ms roberts in the democratic primary amid a run of municipal political upheaval that included a federal corruption inquiry in san francisco voters re elected mayor edwin m lee who faced five little known challengers and threw out the embattled sheriff ross mirkarimi choosing instead vicki hennessy a former sheriff s official who had the endorsement of the mayor and sheriff deputies association also tuesday pennsylvania voters elected three democrats to the state supreme court after a campaign with more than 15 million in spending the new justices christine donohue kevin dougherty and david wecht will shift the court s balance to the democrats the three take office after what justice at stake a watchdog group described as the most expensive judicial race in american history in recent years state level judicial races have often become political battlegrounds for national groups that hope to shape public policy through the courts such was the case in pennsylvania where seven candidates including three democrats and three republicans sought seats on the supreme court in colorado soon after voting ended in jefferson county near denver the associated press projected that voters had decided to oust the majority of a conservative school board that had pursued merit pay for teachers charter schools and other reforms that drew praise from a group funded by the billionaires charles g and david h koch the race in a battleground suburb drew close attention from teachers unions and conservative education
