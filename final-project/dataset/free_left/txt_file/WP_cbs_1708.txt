contributor michael morell each week users can listen to conversations between morell and some of the world s leading intelligence and national security officials and experts the podcast which launched in 2017 was previously produced in partnership with the cipher brief a website dedicated to national security topics intelligence matters richard haass correspondent michael morell producer olivia gazis jamie benson michael morell richard welcome to intelligence matters you know i think you re one of the most knowledgeable people in our country on foreign policy and national security so i think it s terrific for our listeners to get to hear your thoughts on a whole range of issues richard haass well i would describe you the same way so possibly laugh both of us are right or the other possibility michael morell we re both wrong laugh richard haass is neither one of us is right michael morell so richard i d love to start with some strategic questions and then take you on a tour of the world if that s okay media id imhaas mp3 pg 2 richard haass sure michael morell so first strategic question is i would love to hear how you would tell the story of the arc of american foreign policy from the end of world war ii to where we are today what s changed if it s changed why has it changed what were the big muscle movements inflection points et cetera how do you think about that richard haass how many days do we have for the answer michael morell yeah i know so probably about two minutes here richard haass dean acheson who was the american secretary of state after world war ii under truman you know wrote his memoir and he immodestly but probably accurately described it as present at the creation the united states emerged from world war ii as first among not just media id imhaas mp3 pg 3 equals but unequals in the capacity department and essentially put into place institutions relationships to try to structure the post world war ii world and in part succeeded various international institutions and so forth but there was a second set of structure or order that came into being which was the cold war so for four decades after world war ii you had this american led world largely of anti communist countries some of which were democracies alliances international institutions that coexisted with a cold war world that had its own rules and in many ways also structured international relations that lasted as i said for four decades till roughly 1989 1990 and for the last three decades the last 30 years we have been first again first among unequals in many ways but we ve had to contend media id imhaas mp3 pg 4 with everything from the rise of china the alienation of the former soviet union of russia the dispersion of power around the world proliferation to places like north korea before that pakistan india and so forth the rise of all sorts of new technologies that again put capacity in lots of hands social media what have you and i think what s new in recent years is that until a couple years ago i would say certainly to the trump administration most american presidents if i can use a sporting metaphor mike operated within the 40 yards lines from truman through obama might ve been on the right side of the field might ve been on the left side of the field but basically bought into this post world war ii order of american leadership alliances international institutions 00 03 13 12 i think with barack obama you saw some questions of moving media id imhaas mp3 pg 5 away from it simply because he thought the costs were too high began to dial it back and under mr trump there s been a major acceleration he s really the first president who s an outlier so rather than being part of the truman through obama line he represents something different doesn t believe in free trade questions the value of alliances questions the value of multilateralism quite honestly based on my own conversations with him questions the foreign policy proposition that american leadership in the world is worth it so he represents a departure and just to end up i think the real question going forward is he the aberration and then we come back to something like what we ve seen or does it turn out that the last 70 75 years is the aberration and that history begins to resemble more what it looked like before world war ii that s the big question media id imhaas mp3 pg 6 michael morell so what do you think the answer to that question is is he the aberration or does he represent something that s more fundamental to what s going on in american politics and how americans think about this richard haass i know what i hope the answer is obviously that we continue to carry out most if not all of our traditional role i fear that s not gonna be the case i think that trumpism is alive and well in the country he s as much a reflection as he is a cause and i think the post trump republican party can carry on many of these features not all but many and we re seeing elements of it in the democratic party if you watch the democratic debates you know i work at the council on foreign relations we sent a questionnaire to all the democratic candidates gave em a dozen questions if you read the answers on media id imhaas mp3 pg 7 afghanistan you read the answers on trade there s surprising overlap between most of the democrats and elements of mr trump and again i think they re reflecting the intervention fatigue felt in this country after iraq and afghanistan understandably i think they re also reflecting of frustrations things haven t been as good at home the stagnation in middle class incomes and there s a tendency to scapegoat foreign policy scapegoat trade and so forth so my concern is that even after donald trump even if it s less extreme that the next decade or even longer of american foreign policy may still represent a significant pulling back from the sort of role that we ve played for 70 years and i believe served us well michael morell so if you were standing in front of a group of americans who believe media id imhaas mp3 pg 8 all of what you just said or pieces of what you just said how would you make an argument to them of why american leadership is so important richard haass i m glad you asked me that two ways one is i would explain the connection between what happens in the world and the quality of life in the united states i think most americans see foreign policy as foreign i would make the argument that foreign policy is anything but foreign we learned it the hard way on 9 11 we learn it every day whether we realize it or not economically if a zika epidemic breaks out in parts of africa it could reach the united states refugees climate change what i would try to do first of all is make the case that foreign policy matters that you can t separate how we do as a society and as an economy from what happens in the world that would be point one media id imhaas mp3 pg 9 and then point two i would make the case that what we need to do the good news is it s affordable if you look at the level of national security spending during the cold war it was at a level that was roughly the share of gdp the share of our economy that it represented was roughly twice what it is now and we did pretty well then so my argument would be we have to act in the world out of self interest and the good news is we can afford to do what we need to do probably if that didn t convince them i d made one other argument that our shortcomings at home which are real whether it s infrastructure or opportunity public education healthcare that those things do not come they re not because of what we spend on foreign policy you can blame foreign policy for a lot but you can t blame foreign policy for the fact that we spend twice the media id imhaas mp3 pg 10 average of other developed countries on healthcare and the last i check we re not twice as healthy and we don t live twice as long we spend a lot on public education we just don t get our money s worth so we need to fix what s going on at home one of my previous books at the risk of plugging a previous book was called foreign policy begins at home there s lots of things we can and should do we re just not doing it and the fault doesn t lie in our foreign policy the fault lies in our domestic politics michael morell and if we can fix those things not only can we make the country stronger from a national security perspective but we can also make the public more willing to let the u s lead in the world richard haass amen and it s one of the reasons we do have to sort things out at home because my concern is it s not just that we media id imhaas mp3 pg 11 won t have the resources if we don t sort things out we won t have the bandwidth if we are divided as a society if we re divided politically we re not gonna be able to come together to deal with what we re gonna also be simply too distracted people are gonna say that s a luxury we gotta fix what s wrong here at home again it s another argument why it s essential we get it right here at home michael morell okay so with all that as backdrop let s kind of go around the world and i d love to start with china which i think is the big enchilada here particularly over the long term richard haass i think that s a mixed metaphor calling china michael morell it is it is richard haass the big enchilada michael morell media id imhaas mp3 pg 12 it is it is so what do you see as our national interest with regard to a rising china how should we think about that and then how should we position ourselves given what we need to achieve here given those interests richard haass i think the operative word here is rising china china s rising so the foreign policy of the united states should not be and won t succeed if it turns out to be to prevent china s rise what we wanna do is to encourage china as it does gain further capacity to use that capacity in constructive ways we wanna shape what china does in the world and how it does it if you will the principal focus of american foreign policy when it comes to china oughta be the foreign policy of china and that means to garner their help in dealing with north korea to discourage any adventurism on their part when it media id imhaas mp3 pg 13 comes to taiwan or the south china sea and so forth we ought to try to shape what china does and where we can great where we can t we then have to think about how to respond and a side part of that is that we can t expect foreign policy to give us all the answers and by that i mean if we re worried about say what china s doing when it come to 5g the answer can t be let s try to stop china how about we do more how about we do better and that s about why don t we increase the amount of federal spending on basic r d why don t we do certain regulatory things that would open up certain capacities for the civilian sector why don t we do something different on immigration to get more talent in or to stay in this country so it s important not to ask too much of our china policy for creating a context in which we successfully deal with media id imhaas mp3 pg 14 china s rise michael morell so based on what you said and i don t wanna put words in your mouth but based on what you just said i would assume that you don t think we re in the right place at the moment richard haass and i don t think michael morell with regard to how we re dealing with china richard haass the short answer is i don t think we re in the right place we may have been too optimistic about bringing china in as a partner to use the phrase a responsible stakeholder to integrate them into our world i think we were right to let them in for example into the wto i don t think we monitored their behavior closely enough but i worry now we re overshooting foreign policy has media id imhaas mp3 pg 15 pendulums like everything else and i think now the pendulum is swinging too far the other way to talk about a cold war blithely either the inevitability of one the reality of one that could happen but nobody should welcome that a 21st century defined by a u s chinese cold war will be a much worse century it would make it far more difficult for us other cooperate on regional or global challenges it increases what we have to spend on defense it increases the odds that at some point the cold war will be hot so we ought to if we can avoid it now obviously it takes two to avoid it so i want a relationship with china where we try to influence their behavior but we also protect the possibility and reality of limited areas of cooperation so we re going to have a relationship that s gonna have multiple media id imhaas mp3 pg 16 personalities but that ought to be our goal michael morell so what would your conversation be with them if you were trying to convince them of having this thing come out in the right place richard haass the conversation i would have with china indeed it s a conversation i have had with china when i ran the policy planning staff at the state department my opposite number was the gentleman who happens to be china s foreign minister right now wang yi and the other person i worked most closely with is china s ambassador to the united states and this was the conversation we had all the time what sort of an international system do we wanna bring about what is a post cold war international system how do we deal with global challenges from terrorism to proliferation to modernizing international media id imhaas mp3 pg 17 financial arrangements to dealing with climate to dealing with global health i wanna bring china into a set of relationships that d be the conversation and i would make the argument why it s in their interest to do so it s not a favor they do for us this is not an only good for america world this is a world that they also would benefit from and i d also make clear if they decide not to do that not only will they pay a price but if they act in ways that we believe are contrary to our interests they will leave us no recourse but to push back whether it s with taiwan or the south china sea or on certain trade you know in the area of trade if they adopt behaviors that we think are simply unfair or inimical to our interests so basically lay out the menu they re gonna have to make decisions now implicit in this let me say one other point and i apologize for going on so long i think we media id imhaas mp3 pg 18 should show concern about what china does at home but i don t think that can or should be the first thing in our relationship i don t think we will succeed and this is where i worked for bush 41 you know at the time of tiananmen i was in the white house and i think the feeling was we criticized them for what they did we sanctioned them for what they did but we also protected a larger relationship and i think that ought to be our navigation going forward michael morell so richard let s stick with east asia north korea no administration has been able to deal successfully with north korea s strategic weapons program its nuclear weapons and its long range missiles how do you think about the threat from north korea is it bigger than what i just said right and how do you assess perhaps how the obama administration approached media id imhaas mp3 pg 19 it and how do you assess president trump s novel approach and what might you do differently richard haass well you re right the policy towards north korea has been a rare case of continuity laugh in american foreign policy that s the good news the bad news is successive administrations have failed to accomplish michael morell every single one richard haass every single one north korea continues to pose a significant conventional military threat to the republic of korea to south korea but obviously what s new and different is the nuclear and missile threat you know this president president trump came in and tried to shake things up and he did it with his threats and he did it with tighter sanctions and he did it with his openness to diplomacy and media id imhaas mp3 pg 20 in principle that was good i think essentially he teed it up well where there s been a failure is after that and i think this denuclearization or nothing approach is misguided well i believe we ought to keep to denuclearization as a long term goal but we ought to be open to lesser interim arrangements we will reduce the degree of the sanctions we put on you in exchange for certain limits on your capacities because what s happened is by having all or nothing diplomacy we now have nothing and since then since the president s been on his unintel north korea is far more capable in the missile realm as well as in the nuclear realm this isn t working you know as bad as it is not mike i mean just say north korea now has an estimated what 30 maybe 35 whatever nuclear warheads imagine a day in five or ten media id imhaas mp3 pg 21 years where they could have 130 and of greater quality on missiles with greater accuracy we do not want to get to the point where north korea represents an existential threat to the united states the president keeps saying he s a patient man he shouldn t be patient here he should feel urgency so the goal of the united states ought to be to cap north korea s capacities as a first step and then see how we can roll them back those capacities so i believe again he was right to get their attention but he s been wrong in how he s done things since michael morell yeah i think he can actually use the relationship he s built right to push to get to those negotiations that you re talking about richard haass i believe he could too i don t understand this insistence on our way or the highway it s simply not working and media id imhaas mp3 pg 22 the north koreans have also figured out that they don t face a threat of military force a war on the korean peninsula would be horrific as you know better than most and the sanctions are deteriorating china russia and others are working around them and that s the history of sanctions you know i ve done several studies of sanctions they rarely if ever accomplish big things and over time what they accomplish tends to go diminish and we re seeing that with north korea so again time is not our friend here michael morell okay richard let s jump to the middle east and iran and i put the middle east in there specifically because i wanted to start by asking you what our interests are in the region and then how you see iran threatening those interests richard haass okay well it s a good place to start i would say our interests in the region in no particular one is still media id imhaas mp3 pg 23 energy resources we may be energy sufficient we are not energy independent and people keep confusing those two words but the energy in the middle east is still critical for the world economy and what happens with the world economy affects us so again no one should use the phrase energy independent so we still have an interest in the production of middle eastern energy oil and gas and its ability to reach its consumers we have a real concern about terrorism not seeing that terrorism gains a footing whether their goals are local or global we have an interest obviously in proliferation and preventing it right now there s one country in the middle east that has nuclear weapons that s israel we don t want to see a second much less a third or fourth of fifth i d say those are our most important media id imhaas mp3 pg 24 interests along with historic support for the wellbeing of the state of israel michael morell and then what about iran s threat to all of that richard haass well iran is a threat to all those things in the sense that we ve seen the attack on saudi oil we ve seen iran support for terrorism in all sorts of ways carrying it out as well as supporting it michael morell over a very long period of time richard haass over very long period of time this is a sustained policy for them it s on one of their principal national security instruments we ve seen iran s nuclear program and the potential of that for breakout to cross lines so iran is a significant threat and i think it s important to understand iran iran is not a status quo country iran is an imperial country and by media id imhaas mp3 pg 25 that i mean it has a vision of the region and a vision of its role that goes beyond its borders and it s realized that to some extent if one looks at lebanon that is success if one looks at syria that is a considerable success if one looks at iraq in some ways the great strategic beneficiary of the iraq war one of the reasons i was against it laugh when i was at the state department is i feared that what has happened would happen which is that iran would benefit from no longer having a country like iraq to offset it so iran has been the great strategic gainer of the last couple of decades and the challenge for us is how do we contain it how do we put certain limits on iranian influence in the region and it s hard because our actual or would be partners in many cases aren t able to play that role and for understandable reasons we want to put a ceiling media id imhaas mp3 pg 26 on how much we are involved and that is the tension in american foreign policy towards iran michael morell and there s a bit of a debate and it s played out in the pages of foreign affairs which is the journal of the council on whether iran is an imperial country or whether it s a revolutionary country michael morell where do you fall in that debate revolutionary in the sense of spreading extremist shia ideology richard haass i actually see them as the same i see it as that s part of their imperial role that again they re not self satisfied to make iran their goal is not to make iran great again that might be one of their goals since the islamic revolution but their goal is to make much of the region in their image and they do it in all sorts of ways and that s a goal i oppose so media id imhaas mp3 pg 27 that means we have to work with local states to strengthen them to make them less vulnerable to push back and we have to try to shape iranian behavior directly and that s where sanctions diplomacy potentially military force come in michael morell how would you assess the obama administration s approach to iran richard haass well the obama administration s approach i m critical of i thought the 2015 nuclear agreement was too generous in many ways the so called sunset provisions were way too short i don t understand at that moment why we didn t get a much more longer lasting agreement why ten years why not 25 years why not 50 years why not permanent i think we should ve pressed for something much longer term and i think part of the reason we didn t is the administration had the you can call it na ve or misguided or just incorrect view media id imhaas mp3 pg 28 that integration with iran dealing with iran would get it to moderate to change funnily enough similar to some of the thinking about china that many administrations have had that integration would bring transformation we haven t seen laugh it with china we haven t seen it with iran so it s time to go back and rethink some of our approach to foreign policy and that so my view the previous administration got an agreement wasn t the agreement i would ve wanted i think we could ve been and should ve been more ambitious and i think the assumption underneath it that time would solve the problem of iran s orientation was simply there was no reason to believe that michael morell all right same question about the trump administration richard haass well trump administration began with a critique of the obama media id imhaas mp3 pg 29 administration but almost like healthcare has thrown it out without a clear substitute i don t see a plan b so it got rid of the agreement but then what now one area that i underestimated was the impact of unilateral american sanctions those have had more of an impact on iran s economy its ability to export oil than i did anticipate but i don t see the administration has decided what its purpose is okay so we ve put pressure on iran but towards what end now for some it may have been regime change well that is not gonna happen it did not happen and will not happen for some it might be that the iranians would simply say uncle we can t take the pain anymore please tell us america what you want us to do ain t gonna happen so what s happened is we put all this pressure on iran without an articulated purpose media id imhaas mp3 pg 30 what i wanted us to do and the administration never did was say hey here s what we are prepared to trade we will lighten up on sanctions if you accept the following say in the nuclear realm or the missile realm or in some other realm we haven t done it with north korea other than saying the only thing that s good enough is denuclearization we ve made a similar mistake with iran we haven t basically said we are prepared to ease sanctions in exchange for these behavioral changes we never ever did that so instead we basically carried out economic warfare against iran and what s now happened is over the last few months iran has responded two ways one is with physical warfare military warfare against us and our michael morell trying to impose a cost on us for our behavior media id imhaas mp3 pg 31 richard haass exactly saying you re gonna use the economic instrument of war we re gonna use the drones or we re gonna use missiles we re gonna use you know what have you mines in the waterways so there s one and second of all they ve begun the process of breaking out of the constraints in the 2015 nuclear agreement so we re at a point here where we have to decide what it is we want so we can put more pressure on iran economically if there s much we haven t done or we can use cyber or we can use military force but again iran is going to retaliate what still is missing from u s foreign policy is a purpose with iran we haven t told the iranians here s the deal now they may push back and say we don t like that deal how about this deal fine the last i checked that s called diplomacy that s why you know you have media id imhaas mp3 pg 32 diplomats presumably who do that the biggest question is what is our definition of success here what is our goal we continue to put pressure on iran without a clear purpose michael morell so richard last big issue russia how do you think about russia how do you think about it as a threat to our interests how do you think we re handling it how do you think we should handle it richard haass i actually michael morell big questions richard haass we re gonna have a big debate one day about russia and it s gonna be a historical debate and it ll be a version of who lost russia people will look at the end of the cold war when soviet union transformed into russia basically the soviet union had two empires you had the external empire in eastern media id imhaas mp3 pg 33 europe and you had the internal empire that was the soviet union itself both unraveled and the hope was that we could have a good relationship with russia and it hasn t worked and the question is why not and there s one school of thought that said that was wishful thinking you were never gonna have it given russian political culture history interests and the rest and the other would say we blew it we weren t generous enough on the economic side with things like nato enlargement we kindled or rekindled nationalist sentiments in russia i don t know mike i don t know the answer to that question but i was not a great enthusiast of nato enlargement i thought there were other ways we could ve structured and stabilized post cold war europe that said we are where we media id imhaas mp3 pg 34 are where we are i think you know russia s now an outlier under mr putin i don t think things will get materially better so long as he s there because he wants no part of what we used to call the liberal world order he sees it as a threat to his continued rule so my view is we push back wherever we have we make nato stronger we help ukraine but the one area that i don t want to see unravel is the nuclear area so again almost what i said about china before we don t have the luxury of an all or nothing relationship with china we need to have areas of cooperation even if we have large areas of competition same with russia we may disagree with russia here there but not everywhere we do not want what happened with the intermediate range nuclear agreement to be a precursor for the long range media id imhaas mp3 pg 35 you know we don t wanna be spending the dollars on that we don t want the risk of that of a whole new wave of nuclear modernization and competition so my view again with putin is let s have diplomacy actually i never would ve kicked him out of the g8 i don t think diplomacy should be seen as a favor we bestow on others keep him there have him there and disagree with him it s not a favor michael morell it s a tool we use richard haass exactly it s a tool so i don t understand why we have so much trouble wrapping ourselves around the idea that diplomacy is a tool it s not for sissies it can be a really hard edge tool anyhow but i would have serious negotiations on strategic nuclear forces i d be talking to russia about the middle east even though we media id imhaas mp3 pg 36 disagreed about syria we may not disagree about everything and they matter they matter for north korea they matter for venezuela for all these countries again where we can protect or carve out limited areas of cooperation we should do it even if under mr putin the overall character of the relationship s gonna be pretty hostile michael morell so richard two institutional questions the first is how would you assess the health of our national security institutions richard haass short answer laugh once when brezhnev was general secretary he was asked comrade brezhnev what is the health of the soviet economy and he said good and they said well could you say a little bit more laugh like in two words and he said not good michael morell yeah i remember that laugh media id imhaas mp3 pg 37 richard haass that s where i am about america s national security institutions state department has been decimated sorry to say it but i think that will be rex tillerson s legacy and i don t think mike pompeo has done nearly enough to turn it around john michael morell and it was under invested in before that as well right richard haass indeed john bolton did a real number on the national security council the intelligence community i worry that its relationship with policy makers is not what it could and should be probably the pentagon and the military side of the pentagon is probably the best off of all of those but as a whole i worry about the state of the institutions i worry we re not attracting the young talent we should and i really worry about the lack of a systematic process you and i are both veterans of more media id imhaas mp3 pg 38 interagency meetings than either of us would care to count but process protects process protects it makes sure that presidents and principals see the options that the intelligence is married to the policy that implementation and execution are discipline and i worry about the ad hoc ery the informality that we re seeing in government right now michael morell on more than one occasion in those meetings somebody would say hey have you thought about this right and the this was really important and if they weren t there you would ve missed the this richard haass 100 and again even if it slows you down a bit that s a price worth paying in my experience you almost always pay a price for a lack of process you just don t think of things as you say implementation doesn t match decision media id imhaas mp3 pg 39 you rush to judgment i mean the fact that the iraq war for example in 2002 and 2003 was launched without a formal inter agency meeting that really carefully and systematically looked at all the options that people weren t thinking systematically about the aftermath and what that would require that tells you something we should not conduct foreign policy on the fly michael morell okay three final questions richard which president do you admire the most from a foreign policy perspective richard haass well one i worked for is the 41st president george herbert walker bush i was at the white house for all four of those years and i just think that he and brent scowcroft jim baker and others bob gates deserve tremendous credit one i didn t work for is harry truman if you asked me who were the two best foreign policy presidents of the post world war ii modern era i would say truman and bush media id imhaas mp3 pg 40 41 michael morell and what made them so good richard haass truman in the sense that was willing to think big and to break with the past in so many ways to basically have the united states permanently involved in the world was a fundamental break from the tradition of american isolationism he surrounded himself with great people the achesons and others and was willing to take the country in places they didn t want to go a lot of that applies to bush after the cold war he basically said we still have things to do in the world he said this will not stand when the iraqis invaded kuwait surrounded himself with extraordinarily talented people and made sure the system worked media id imhaas mp3 pg 41 and at times you know again took the country in places they didn t want to do and did it in a generous way it wasn t to put it bluntly an american first approach it was one where we worked with others we had the coalition that dealt with the gulf challenge he tried to bring the world and the country along with him to a considerable degree michael morell and of those folks who you worked for directly who did you learn the most from about foreign policy richard haass i would probably say brent scowcroft it s hard though because i m so close to him and he was and is one of my favorite people on the planet and it was partially the issues but less the issues the learning was more from the process to watch the way brent ran the inter agency process that s where i really learned about how we dealt with these big personalities how they trusted him in a way that leaks didn t happen media id imhaas mp3 pg 42 things were so good that a jim baker or dick cheney wouldn t demand to see the president they knew that brent would represent their position faithfully to the president as good as they could do it and that the president would hear their views and so forth what i learned from brent was how to run a system with real integrity that was to me the great learning and you know but it wasn t just brent you had baker you had cheney you had gates i mean colin powell michael morell what a team huh richard haass well what a constellation of talent michael morell and the last question and maybe we ve talked about this already is when it comes to the security of the country what worries you the most richard haass media id imhaas mp3 pg 43 well that s easy we hinted at it before it s not china it s not russia it s not a specific threat out there it s us i worry about our disunity and our dysfunction and i worry that we re not taking the world as seriously as we ought to take it we re not devoting the resources we re not structuring the decision making process i worry that in part you know we don t teach it kids are graduating you know my pet peeve kids are graduating from the best universities and schools in the country and don t understand this world they re about to enter so that s what worries me it s that we have a society here at home that increasingly doesn t understand why it s in our interest to continue to play a large role in the world and that s what worries me more than anything else michael morell richard thank you for your time media id imhaas mp3 pg 44 richard haass thanks for having me mike end of transcript first published on september 25 2019 6 33 am 2019 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know get the latest breaking news delivered straight to
