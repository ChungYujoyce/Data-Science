advertisement supported by critic s notebook in isolation the d i y fantasy world of the chinese youtube star is a dreamy escape and a lesson in self reliance by tejal rao like so many home cooks in quarantine after i ve used up the green tops of my scallions i drop the white hairy roots into a glass of water to regenerate feeling pleased with my own sense of thrift and pragmatism but last week after the chinese internet star li ziqi posted a new cooking video to youtube called the life of garlic i wished i could graduate from scallions on the windowsill in the 12 minute video which already has over seven million views ms li pushes garlic cloves into a patch of earth outside her home a time lapse shows the sprouts growing reaching up toward the sky ms li saut es the young fresh green garlic shoots with pork when she harvests the bulbs she plaits the stems hanging them up to finish the drying process pickling and preserving the rest and using some to season chicken feet and dress salad ms li who lives in a village in sichuan province and rarely speaks to press looks not unlike a disney princess in her crown braids wearing a silvery fur cape trudging gracefully in the snow at 29 she is famous for her mesmerizing videos of rural self sufficiency posted on weibo and youtube for a worldwide audience in isolation her d i y pastoral fantasies have become a reliable source of escape and comfort i usually plan to watch one just one but then i let the algorithm guide me to another and another until soothed by bird song and instrumentals i m convinced that i m absorbing useful information from ms li about how to live off the land if i m ever stuck with two dozen sweet potatoes i now have some idea how to extract the starch and use it to make noodles this is what i tell myself leave me alone in a lotus pond and i know how to harvest and prepare the roots ms li doesn t explain anything as she goes in fact she tends to work in silence without the use of any modern kitchen gadgets her sieve is a gourd her grater is a piece of metal that she punctures at an angle then attaches to two pieces of wood her basin is a stream where she washes the dirt from vegetables her kitchen is nothing like mine in los angeles but watching ms li on my laptop while eating a bowl of buttered popcorn for dinner i think maybe i could be happy living like that too soaking in the sheer natural beauty of the countryside devoting myself to extremely traditional ways of cooking ms li makes peach blossom wine and cherry wine preserves loquats and rose petals she makes fresh tofu and lanzhou style noodle soup with a perfectly clear broth and ferments sichuan broad bean paste from scratch she butchers ducks and whole animals she is not known for taking shortcuts a video about matsutake mushrooms begins with her building the grill to cook them laying the bricks down one at a time scraping the mortar smooth then hunting for mushrooms in the woods in a video about cooking fish she first goes fishing in the snow patiently throwing back any catches that are too small as snowflakes freeze into her hair like the main character in some kind of post apocalyptic novel ms li is almost always alone though she doesn t seem lonely riding her horse through fields of wildflowers or carrying baskets of sweet potatoes under citrus trees she seems tireless focused confident independent the videos are deeply soothing but it s not just that they reveal the intricacy and intensity of labor that goes into every single component of every single dish while also making the long solitary processes of producing food seem meaningful and worthwhile it s the complete opposite of most cooking content the kind that suggests that everything is so quick and easy that you can do it too and probably in less than 30 minutes but ms li also romanticizes the struggles of farm life and as any savvy influencer would monetizes that appeal in her online shop she sells a curved cleaver similar to the ones she uses in her videos as well as loose hanfu inspired linen clothing sichuan ginseng honey and chile sauces skeptics are suspicious of her access to youtube in china where the platform is blocked and though it seems unlikely some people have wondered in the comment sections if her videos are propaganda ms li s story as she tells it is that she left home as a teenager to find work but returned to the countryside to take care of her grandmother then began documenting her life though she used to shoot her videos alone on her phone she now works with an assistant and a videographer i simply want people in the city to know where their food comes from ms li said in a rare interview with goldthread last fall she never responded to my requests but most of the world s food whether in china or the united states doesn t come from anyone s backyard and isn t made from scratch noodles are produced and packaged in factories chickens and pigs are gutted on fast dangerous lines the fragility of our industrial supply chains and the immense risks for the people who work in commercial plants and slaughterhouses have been laid bare in the last few weeks ms li sidesteps the existence of that broken system entirely this is the powerful fantasy of her videos right now people growing and cooking all of their own food not wasting anything and not needing anything more than what they already have around them in isolation watching ms li gather rose petals and ripe tomatoes i catch myself thinking is this sequence set in the past or the future are these videos a record of
