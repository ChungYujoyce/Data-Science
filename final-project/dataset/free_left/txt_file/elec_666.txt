 2016 new surveys suggest the gop nominee is perilously close to a historic rebuke by steven shepard 10 18 2016 05 02 am edt polls conducted since the first presidential debate last month put donald trump on a pace to earn a smaller percentage of the vote than any major party nominee in at least 20 years in matchups that include third party candidates trump is winning on average 39 6 percent of the vote compared to 46 2 percent for hillary clinton in the dozen national polls using live telephone interviewers conducted since september 26 advertisement for much of the presidential campaign the focus has been on trump s apparent ceiling he has been unable to grow his coalition to the extent necessary to claim the lead over clinton now though after weeks of negative news coverage after trump s poor performance in the first debate the tape of his sexually aggressive remarks leaked earlier this month and reports from a number of women claiming he sexually assaulted or harassed them it s also clear trump has a floor of about 40 percent of the electorate that means while he lags behind clinton this year trump appears unlikely to end up with a smaller percentage of the vote than george h w bush did in 1992 against bill clinton the battleground project by katie glueck that s largely a function of the country s high degree of polarization and voters negative perception of hillary clinton pollsters said though clinton s favorable ratings are markedly better than trump s in the end it s likely to be pretty much the same in other presidential elections given the change in the demographics from 2012 said mark mellman a veteran democratic pollster who worked for then sen john kerry in the 2004 presidential race of all the new national and battleground state polling out over the past few days only two were conducted entirely after a number of women went public to claim trump assaulted or harassed them and those two polls show clinton with some of her largest leads a cbs news poll conducted last wednesday the day many of the allegations became public through sunday gives clinton an 11 point lead over trump in an initial two way matchup in a subsequent question that includes the third party candidates clinton s lead contracts to 9 points clinton s lead is 12 points in a monmouth university poll conducted friday through sunday the monmouth poll was the most recent friday through sunday those two new polls conducted at perhaps trump s lowest moment of the general election not only have clinton with large leads but they also show trump s support cratering trump is at only 40 percent in the cbs news poll s two way matchup and he earns just 38 percent in the four way ballot test the monmouth poll also shows trump at only 38 percent in a four way ballot test congress by rachael bade and jake sherman that leaves trump perilously close to a historic rebuke from american voters for a major party candidate if trump did slip below that 38 percent figure it would be extraordinary in the modern era of presidential politics with the presence of a strong third party candidate in 1992 ross perot george h w bush earned about 37 5 percent of the vote in his historic landslide loss in 1964 barry goldwater earned about 38 5 percent alf landon won just 36 5 percent of the vote in a 1936 landslide loss against franklin roosevelt but even a trump collapse wouldn t challenge john davis and william howard taft who won between 20 and 30 percent of the vote in 1924 and 1912 respectively as progressive party candidates siphoned significant shares of the vote trump however isn t likely to fall below his current standing republicans could come back to trump before election day if he manages to return to an even keel in the cbs news poll trump wins 81 percent among republicans compared to clinton s 92 percent among democrats similarly trump is at 79 percent among republicans in the monmouth poll while clinton is at 88 percent among democrats during the ebbs and flows of the campaign clinton has retained a structural advantage over trump but when trump has closed the gap it has been from consolidating republican votes by ben schreckinger another potential boon to trump the significant third party vote in previous elections the percentage of voters supporting minor party candidates has been smaller than pre election polls would indicate there s a large though declining share of the vote lining up behind libertarian gary johnson and green party nominee jill stein in the latest realclearpolitics average johnson is at 6 2 percent and stein is at 2 2 percent what we have known in the past is that third party candidates are significantly higher in the polls than they are on election day said gop pollster christine matthews is that still true or will gary johnson get 9 percent or 10 percent or will the normal rules apply where you cut it by a fraction the most striking exception to that rule was perot in 1992 perot who withdrew from the race earlier in the year only to throw his hat back into the ring in october earned nearly 19 percent of the vote on election day after running infomercials on broadcast television networks in the closing days of the campaign to boost his numbers but if trump s poll numbers instead continue to tumble it will be difficult to discern what is driving his decline his fluctuations from consolidating republicans to make the race competitive to repelling them after poor debate performances scandal and intemperate remarks to put clinton well ahead have been one unpredictable element in an already volatile election i had assumed that the numbers wouldn t move much from the first debate and they moved more than i thought democratic pollster jef pollock told politico last week before the most recent polls were released if the polls do plummet and the bottom falls out it s going to be hard to predict what is mattering missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get
