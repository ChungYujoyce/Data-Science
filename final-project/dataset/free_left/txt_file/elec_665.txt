do not sell paul who announced on tuesday he was seeking the republican presidential nomination has clashed with reporters in the past several of them female he denied to cnn s wolf blitzer wednesday that his tendency was to interrupt female reporters i think i ve been universally short tempered and testy with both male and female reporters i ll own up to that he said paul said it can be difficult when being interviewed and facing only a camera and not being able to see the reporter particularly if it s a hostile interviewer i do think interviews should be questions and not editorializing you feel somewhat at a loss at the other end he added exhibiting a bit of contrition paul said i think i should have more patience i think it s pretty equal opportunity i was annoyed with a male reporter this morning i will have to get better at holding my tongue and holding my temper he said paul s combative day began when he clashed with today show anchor savannah guthrie over what he said was biased questioning the interview on wednesday took a contentious turn when guthrie began to detail what she said were shifts over the years in his foreign policy views you have had views on foreign policy in the past that are somewhat unorthodox but you seem to have changed over the years guthrie said you once said iran was not a threat now you say it is you once proposed ending foreign aid to israel now you support it at least for the time being and you once offered to drastically cut paul who was speaking by satellite from nashua new hampshire tried to interject why don t you let me explain instead of talking over me ok paul said he then advised guthrie on how to conduct the interview before we go through a litany of things you say i ve changed on why don t you ask me a question have i changed my opinion paul told guthrie that would be sort of a better way to approach an interview when guthrie persisted and asked the republican if iran is still not a threat paul said the nbc host had editorialized listen you ve editorialized paul said let me answer a question you ask a question and you say have your views changed instead of editorializing and saying my views have changed paul contended that his views on foreign aid have been consistent he said circumstances have changed since 2007 when he suggested that iran does not pose a threat to the united states yeah 2007 was a long time ago and events do change over long periods of time so we re talking about eight years ago we re talking about a time when i wasn t running for office when i was helping someone else run for office paul said what i would say is that there has always been a threat of iran gaining nuclear weapons and i think that s greater now than it was many years ago i think we should do everything we can to stop them later on wednesday paul bristled at a question about abortion while talking with reporters in new hampshire why don t you ask the dnc is it ok to kill a seven pound baby in the uterus paul said referring to the democratic national committee his comment came after the associated press published a report that said paul had ducked questions about his views on what exceptions if any he d support if abortion were to be banned paul has previously supported measures that included exceptions for situations like rape and incest as well as measures without those exceptions earlier this year paul clashed with an interviewer in february paul chastised cnbc anchor kelly evans for posing slanted questions when evans tried to press him on a proposed corporate tax holiday paul shushed her calm down a bit here kelly paul told her and like his interview with guthrie on wednesday paul offered evans a suggestion on how she might conduct a better interview so frankly i think if we do this again you need to try to start out with a little more objectivity going into the interview paul told evans when he was asked about his testy interview with guthrie later on wednesday paul decried questions about the apparent changes in his positions o k well we understand that you ve been beating your wife for years and you ve flip flopped on 25 different issues and you used to believe this
