all it s all ahead on face the nation welcome to face the nation since last week s broadcast the number of deaths due to covid 19 in the u s has quadrupled in the last twenty four hours there have been more than thirteen hundred new deaths recorded the hardest hit areas are by now familiar to you the northeast the west coast the south and some parts of the midwest with new york city los angeles new orleans and detroit heavily impacted experts say there is a new wave of so called hotspots coming expanding areas in the northeast mid atlantic and south plus states like indiana and colorado cbs

strassmann fifty states fifty front lines and by far new york has the worst of america s corona contagion man all these patients here mark strassmann forty percent of the country s cases and almost half the deaths andrew cuomo we re not yet at the apex and if we don t stop the spread then it s going to burn down our own country mark strassmann governor cuomo believes new york city is about a

murphy clearly we re in a world of hurt mark strassmann without real time data no model can truly predict when any hotspot will peak but consider the latest trends covid 19 deaths quadrupled in both chicago and detroit over the last week and doubled in new orleans overflow corona patients will head to the city s convention center like the one in new york converted into a military field hospital across america nearly twenty thousand national guardsmen reinforce covid 19 response efforts and for the coast guard it s all hands on deck with cruise ships in portmiami carnival s coral princess

strassmann right off south florida s coast you can see a floating parking lot in all one hundred fourteen cruise ships sail in or near u s waters they carry an unknown number of sick people america is staring at another grim week new cases and deaths will spike again without a vaccine social distancing remains key because only the virus can predict its course end vt mark strassmann the cdc has also begun blood testing groups of people it s looking for signs of previous infection with the virus and one of the goals to get a better sense of just how widespread this epidemic really is margaret margaret brennan mark strassmann reporting from atlanta as most of the world struggles to contain a still surging pandemic china is over the worst and things are getting back to normal cbs news senior foreign correspondent elizabeth palmer reports elizabeth palmer cbs news senior foreign correspondent elizapalmer margaret now that the worst is over and there s no sign so far anyway of a second wave of infection china declared a national day of mourning begin vt elizabeth palmer nationwide people stopped wherever they were and joined president xi and the party leadership to remember what china says was three thousand three hundred and thirty three victims that now sounds shockingly low compared to more than thirty thousand deaths in europe alone in spain a pop up hospital in madrid s conference center has a thousand acutely ill patients the country has the second largest number of cases in the world after the united states but at last some good news pedro sanchez speaking foreign language elizabeth palmer prime minister pedro sanchez announced the peak is almost over and in italy too the rates of infection and death have flattened grateful shoppers in rome were back at a local street market this weekend after one of the strictest lockdowns anywhere by contrast in much of the developing world including brazil the death toll is mounting fast there president bolsonaro tweeted that coronavirus is just a little flu which so infuriated rio citizens they beat pots and pans on their balconies to protest his lack of leadership here in the u k there is still limited freedom of movement evidence suggests the infection will peak next weekend prime minister boris johnson himself still sick with covid 19 begged people to continue to follow the rules boris johnson internet video please please stick with the guidance now elizabeth palmer that is if you go out for exercise stay two yards apart and heed the police one british institution did go ahead this weekend the grand national horse race but virtually britons could bet on these computer generated horses all the proceeds went to health care end vt elizabeth palmer in a few hours queen elizabeth is going to make a rare special address to the nation just the fifth time she s done that in almost seventy years on the throne it s to unify the country and to thank people for everything they ve done in this time of extraordinary hardship margaret margaret brennan elizabeth palmer thank you we turn now to doctor anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at nih doctor fauci thank you for what you re doing and thank you for making time for us anthony fauci md director national institute of allergy and infectious diseases good to be with you margaret margaret brennan we heard from the president that there will be a lot of death in the coming weeks doctor birx said it s not the time to go to the grocery store or the pharmacy what should americans be preparing for anthony fauci well this is going to be a bad week margaret unfortunately if you look at the projection of the curves of the kinetics of the curves we re going to continue to see an escalation also we should hope that within a week maybe a little bit more we ll start to see a flattening out of the curve and coming down the mitigation that we re talking about that you just mentioned is absolutely key to the success of that so on the one hand things are going to get bad and we need to be prepared for that it is going to be shocking to some it certainly is is is really disturbing to see that but that s what s going to happen before it turns around so we ll just buckle down continue to mitigate continue to do the physical separation because we got to get through this week that s coming up because it is going to be a bad week margaret brennan are you saying doctor that despite the deaths that we may see that mitigation is working and that you do have this outbreak anthony fauci yes margaret brennan under control anthony fauci i will not say we have it under control margaret that would be a false statement we are struggling to get it under control and that s the issue that s at hand right now the thing that s important is that what you see is increases in new cases which then start to flatten out but the end result of that you don t see for days if not weeks down the pike because as the as the cases go down then you get less hospitalizations less intensive care and less death so even though you re getting a really improvement in that the number of new cases is starting to flatten the deaths will lag by you know one or two weeks or more so we need to be prepared that even though it s clear that mitigation is working we re still going to see that tail off of deaths so the first thing we want to look for is to see on a daily basis are the number of new cases starting to stabilize we ve seen that in italy you just mentioned that correctly we re going to hopefully be seeing that in new york very soon and that s the first sign of that plateau and coming down margaret brennan so when governor cuomo says we re new york is not yet at the apex what does that actually mean and and what happens on the other side of that apex anthony fauci yeah what the governor is saying is that we are still going to see an increase the curves that we show at the conferences often is that the epidemic curve goes up and it hits the top a bit and then it starts coming down so what governor cuomo was saying is that we haven t yet reached that peak and when you do you ll start to see a bit of a flattening and come down so where we are right now is really approaching that apex and that s why what he s saying and what we re saying is that this next week is going to look bad because we re still not yet at that apex and i think within a week eight days or nine days or so we hopefully you re going to see that turnaround margaret brennan you have flagged that you see this virus now spreading in the developing world and communities where people don t really have the luxuries that we have of working at home what does that mean for the risk of re infection here in the united states anthony fauci well you bring up a very good point margaret unless we get this globally under control there s a very good chance that it will assume a seasonal nature in the sense that even if we and i and i hope it s not just if but when we get it down to the point where it really is at a very low level we need to be prepared that since it unlikely will be completely eradicated from the planet that as we get into next season we may see the beginning of a resurgence and that s the reason why we re pushing so hard and getting our preparedness much better than it was but importantly pushing on a vaccine and doing clinical trials for therapeutic interventions so that hopefully if in fact we do see that resurgence we will have interventions that we did not have in the beginning of the situation that we re in right now margaret brennan so you said yesterday that there are three things you think this country needs to have in place before some of these restrictions are pulled back the ability to test to isolate and to do contact tracing how close are we to meeting those requirements you laid out anthony fauci we re not a hundred percent there yet but the people who are responsible for getting these tests out there it s very clear that we are much much better off than we were in the sense that in the next week or two we ll have an extraordinary amount more capability of doing the kinds of testing that s essential because testing is not only important to be able to identify individual cases isolate them and contact tracing but we really do need to get a feel for what the penetrance of this infection is in society that becomes critical when you plan to start to get back to normal or at least take those first steps to getting back to normal you have to know what s out there you have to know what you re dealing with so testing becomes even more important than what we ve been speaking about in the past margaret brennan do you wear a mask when you re not on television anthony fauci well you know my my life is is is pretty different i i stay six feet away from anybody that i can if i go out which i really don t do very much because of of my life as it is now margaret i would and do if you go to a situation where you don t have control over that six foot distance that you wear a mask in fact my wife just went out to get us some food for for the morning and she doesn t wear a mask in the house or when we go out and run but when she gets into a situation as i would where you don t have the power or the control of staying six feet away i would recommend doing what the cdc as i think appropriately and correctly said it s it s an adjunct it s an additional way margaret brennan mm hm anthony fauci to help protect you and to have you help protect others margaret brennan doctor what would you tell our viewers who live in south carolina arkansas wyoming south dakota iowa nebraska north dakota utah the eight states that do not have stay at home orders what does that do to the white house models of projected deaths are they putting the rest of the country at risk anthony fauci yeah well it isn t that they re putting the rest of the country at risk as much as they re putting themselves at risk so every time i get to that podium in the white house briefing room margaret i always essentially plead with people to please take a look at those very simple guidelines of physical separation and they re very very clear they re like multiple different ways that say all the same thing physically separate six feet away ten people in a crowd avoid any interaction like movies and sports events and theaters and things like that even in areas where you re not having a big explosion of cases to the best of your ability do that because this virus doesn t discriminate whether you re in a small town in a relatively margaret brennan yeah anthony fauci secluded area of the country versus whether you re in a big city and sooner or later you re going to see a surge of cases margaret brennan okay anthony fauci so i would urge people to please take a look at that margaret brennan very quickly is hydroxychloroquine preventative against this virus yes or no anthony fauci you know as i ve said many times margaret the data are really just at best suggestive there have been cases that show there may be an effect margaret brennan yeah anthony fauci and there are others to show there s no effect margaret brennan okay anthony fauci so i think in terms of science i don t think we could definitively margaret brennan all right anthony fauci say it works margaret brennan thank you good luck to you doctor we will be right back with a look at our struggling economy stay with us announcements margaret brennan the breathtaking speed of this global economic contraction is unlike anything we ve ever experienced and that makes it very difficult to project out what this slowdown will mean this week there were more than six and a half million new unemployment claims filed by now jobless americans combined with over three million last week that means nearly ten million americans have lost jobs in less than a month we turn now to james bullard president and ceo of the federal reserve bank of st louis one of twelve banks that make up the federal reserve system he joins us from st louis good to have you with us james bullard president and ceo federal reserve bank of st louis pleasure to be here margaret brennan you and your team have predicted that forty seven million americans could lose their jobs bringing the jobless rate above thirty percent it it sounds like you re saying the job market is in free fall where do you see this happening what americans what industries james bullard yeah i would push back against the idea of the economy or the job market being in free fall we re asking people to stay home to invest in national health and we re asking them to use the unemployment insurance program in order to get the transfers they need to be able to pay bills while they re at home while they re not able to work because health authorities are trying to get the virus under control our estimates which are available at our blog st louis fed on the economy blog suggests the unemployment rate could go anywhere between ten percent and forty two percent the thirty two percent number is a is a compromise in the middle margaret brennan well that s what i m asking you about i mean there s this idea when i speak to business leaders in particular that some of those jobs are going to come back that these are temporary furloughs that they will be somehow just a switch that flips on and the economy will come back roaring isn t that a little bit of a projection of a perfect scenario here james bullard well i i think it can be done whether it will be done depends on execution i thought congress did a great thing in in passing their bill i thought it was appropriately sized for this situation the object is to keep everybody whole during the period when you re asking people to not go to their jobs and not go to the shops and and basically not participate in the economy margaret brennan right james bullard so in some ways in some ways the the uptake on the unemployment insurance program is a good thing because it means you re getting the transfers to the people that are being disrupted by this health ordered shutdown margaret brennan when you talk about transfers you know we saw one of the emergency programs launched by the government this three hundred and fifty billion dollar package to help small businesses supposed to be up and operational this week but that s not actually happening according to some of the biggest banks like citi like they re not even accepting applications right now what is the real world impact of delays like that because the money is needed now james bullard it sure is and we re in the middle of a national crisis so you would expect some chaos but we talked to the sba the small business administration on friday they actually originated a lot of loans on friday i thought it was close to four billion if i have it right and they are going to have even bigger days on monday and tuesday here i think i think there is a lot of potential for that program to be successful margaret brennan but what about the size of this rescue package the president said as recently as yesterday that he thinks there may need to be more money offered to small businesses than what has already been authorized by congress do you think we need a fourth rescue package james bullard i felt like this one was well sized for the situation i think most of the impact is going to come in the second quarter here which just started a few days ago if you think about the u s economy with very round numbers we produce about five trillion dollars worth of goods and services and hence five trillion dollars worth of income every quarter this shutdown means that we re trying to only produce essential services and this the goods and services that can be produced by workers working from home surely that s less than fifty percent of the total economy so income is going to be down fifty percent if you said that s two and a half trillion that sounds like about the number that congress came up with here so in that sense i think you ve got the right amount of resources the challenge is how are you going to get that to the right people margaret brennan right james bullard that really have been disrupted and that s the execution risk that we have here but in principle this is an understandable situation we do not want people to go back to the basketball games we do not want people to get on planes while people while this disease is ravaging the economy so we want them to be able to pay bills keep people whole during this crisis and then we ll come out on the other side there s nothing wrong with the economy itself the economy was actually doing quite well going into this health situation margaret brennan well i i know but that has that assumption also built into consumer psychology that people will be sick feel safe enough to do the things that they did before do you think that this global economy is going to look the same on the other side of this pandemic are those jobs actually going to exist for people to go back to james bullard you know i have good news for you margaret because we have a there is a solution using available technology today to fix the economic part of this problem the solution is universal testing what you want is every single person to get tested every day and then they would wear a badge like they would at a after they voted or something like that to show that they ve been tested this would immediately sort out who s been infected and who hasn t been infected that would help the health care sector but it would also help the economy because we could interact with each other with a lot of confidence margaret brennan well we will talk about that surveillance portion of the equation that you just referenced there ahead stay with us more face the nation announcements margaret brennan late friday president trump continued with his post impeachment payback he abruptly fired michael atkinson the inspector general of the intelligence community who told congress of the whistleblower complaint that ultimately led to the president s impeachment announcements margaret brennan we ll be right back with more face the nation announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation michael dowling is the president and ceo of northwell health the largest health care provider in new york state he joins us this morning from long island thank you for joining us michael dowling president and ceo northwell health michaeljdowling thank you so much pleasure to be here margaret brennan i know in addition to your day job governor cuomo had also asked you to help increase hospital capacity across the state this morning the defense secretary said that about a thousand military medical professionals will be sent to new york today and tomorrow does that solve the problem is new york poised for this apex now michael dowling yes i think we are we re as prepared as we can possibly be obviously if another resource comes in from the federal government that is great as long as it is a resource that can help us we have had a situation in new york where we have had federal assistance with the comfort ship on the west side of manhattan and the javits center and up to this point they haven t been able to take that many patients because of the criteria that they use for admission to the facility so to the extent that they arrive here to the extent that that can be helpful obviously it s all great we welcome all help and we appreciate the offers and if if it all works i think we will all be better off for it margaret brennan is staffing the chief issue right now michael dowling well staffing is always an issue because the severity of the issue we ve been in this now for a couple of weeks and the intensive care staff the physicians on the front lines we have we have to use staff over and over we have to put staff on overtime we are getting staff in from around the united states we re getting staff from upstate new york so finding the capacity is one thing you can create the beds that s the easiest part because you can create an icu bed or a bed pretty much any place and we have plenty of beds the issue then becomes each and every day making sure that you have the right staff with the right skill levels to make sure that you can take care of the patients in the optimum way that you would want to take care of them so yes staff is is always a an issue but we are we are well prepared at the moment and we will be well prepared no matter when that apex comes margaret brennan yeah michael dowling whether it s this week or next week we will be prepared margaret brennan there was a memo from northwell from your company published by politico michael dowling yeah margaret brennan outlining guidance to medical staff basically to help triage and decide who gets a ventilator and who gets to stay on one are we close michael dowling we we margaret brennan at to that point michael dowling we are not margaret brennan of having to make those hard decisions michael dowling yeah we are not at that point at all we have sufficient ventilators for the foreseeable future and we re obviously getting more supply and the governor cuomo has been a major major quarterback in that effort the policy that you you reference is a draft policy it is something that we like to prepare for the inevitability in case that we ever have to do something in the future you have to have a policy prepared well in advance margaret brennan mm hm michael dowling i don t think we will ever get to that point but it would be foolish to wait until you have a disaster and then try to develop the policy margaret brennan yeah michael dowling during that situation so this is all preparation it s just the draft it s not happening we hope it never happens but if it does we are prepared margaret brennan understood if a patient has to go on a ventilator what is the chance of survival what are you seeing michael dowling well what we re seeing and i think it s across all areas all of all facilities that if you go on a ventilator there is about a twenty percent chance that you will survive we have had obviously patients survive off ventilators but it s about a twenty percent chance and as you know people are on the ventilators a long period of time but we ve had successes and the other thing i d just like to mention here because i think the public sometimes gets can get not always the right information we ve had lots of people discharged from the hospital successfully after they have been treated many after they have been on a ventilator margaret brennan mm hm michael dowling so in our system alone about three hundred people each and every day after successful treatment for the covid virus actually go home that is success that s what we ve got to also be talking about and thinking about and celebrating that s the good news and i think good news is what everybody needs right now margaret brennan what are you telling your your hospital workers the doctors and nurses who who work at all of your facilities do you have enough michael dowling well margaret brennan protective equipment for them michael dowling yes we have enough protective equipment and what s amazing here is that at times of crisis like this charac people s character reveals itself you see extraordinary work being do by being done by not just doctors and nurses you see hospitals being retrofitted to put beds where beds never before existed you see sadness among employees when things don t go well but you see joy and celebration when there are successes we are seeing in many ways the best of humanity i am out in the meeting with the physicians and meeting with the staff on the front lines and i can tell you that we should sit back and say how fortunate we are to have people with that commitment that compassion that courage to do what it is they re doing each and every day to protect the rest of us we are very lucky for the with the health sect the health care systems that we have we are very very very fortunate and we should never forget about it and so when this is all over and when you can get close to people eventually with social distan distancing is over with margaret brennan mm hm michael dowling for everybody out there if you see a healthcare worker especially a nurse or a doctor that have been on the front lines margaret brennan yes michael dowling please give them a hug don t do it today do it later because these are margaret brennan good advice we ll clap we will clap michael dowling special special special people margaret brennan we will clap for now as doctor fauci recommended michael dowling clap for now yes margaret brennan thank you thank you mike mike dowling there of northwell health and we go to connecticut and former fda commissioner scott gottlieb thank you for joining us again scott gottlieb m d former fda commissioner scottgottliebmd thanks margaret brennan you just heard the descriptions there from a hospital in the on the front lines up in new york doctor fauci was pretty direct he said it s not going to be an easy week do you believe that as he says mitigation is working scott gottlieb mitigation s clearly working we re seeing cases slow in the northeast and the northern states the sun belt is going to be in for a tough week we re going to see cases in the sun belt start to accelerate i think the new york city health system is going to be brought right to the brink but they re not going to go over they re expanding their capacity to keep pace with their surge of demand really a historic effort and i don t think they re going to run out of ventilators they re doing things to convert existing devices into ventilators and i think they ll keep pace with it but it s a historic effort that s underway in new york right now and we should make no mistake what they re doing to try to keep pace with the increased demand that demand is likely to peak in the next week or two so we re going to see a backdrop this week of of severe strain on the new york city health care system at the same time that cases in the south margaret brennan yeah scott gottlieb start to accelerate margaret brennan what but what are some of the the lessons of what we re seeing in new york right now because we re hearing and i know you ve been tweeting about some of the unusual things younger patients being hospitalized at alarming rates in new york in particular why is that happening scott gottlieb right well we don t understand i mean this infection is not just an infection that s causing severe outcomes in older americans as was originally initially put forward a lot of young people are having bad outcomes are intubated right now in the icus with no comorbidities no otherwise no risk factors that would predict a bad outcome there s pregnant women intubated and in hospitals right now we need to understand that there s been no publication serious publication by the cdc of the collective clinical experience in this united states in the united states right now so doctors are making decisions based on anecdote and their own clinical experiences there s really no excuse for that right now we need to start getting literature out right away to inform providers on what s working and what s not you heard the hospital chief there say about eighty to seventy to eighty percent of people who get intubated succumb to their infection that s what i m hearing from other hospitals doctors are now experimenting with more fluids they re experimenting with high flow oxygen they re experimenting by putting patients in the prone position meaning laying them on their stomach rather than on their backs when they re intubated this is stuff that doctors are figuring out from their own clinical experience but really what we should have is literature published by the cdc that delineates what s working and what s not so doctors margaret brennan yeah scott gottlieb can take a more systematic data driven approach to these things margaret brennan so tell me about the timeline here the president said this week that he thinks we should be able as a country to hold mass gatherings like the republican national committee in august is that too aggressive a timeline for you scott gottlieb i think things are going to be permanently changed coming out of this until we get to a vaccine and we can fully vanquish this we re not going to see a v shaped recovery or a quick snapback absent the ability to get a highly effective drug in the hands of doctors that can mitigate the risk either used as a prophylaxis to prevent infection in people who get exposed to this virus or treat people who get the virus and are are likely at a high risk of a bad outcome we can have that kind of drug by the summer and certainly by the fall i don t see the kind of deliberate industrial approach all hands on deck approach to trying to get that kind of therapeutic and there are things that are promising right now that could be brought forward more quickly but absent that this is going to be an eighty percent economy there are things that are not coming back people are not going to crowd into conferences margaret brennan yeah scott gottlieb they re not going to crowd into arenas the marginal customer is not going back to movie theaters and cruises and disneyland and we need to accept that now what changes that equation is technology but we need a deliberate approach to getting that technology quickly margaret brennan so you ve mentioned technology the fed president from st louis mentioned technology doctor fauci has mentioned technology and surveillance specifically what does that look like in the united states of america and how far are we from getting that scott gottlieb well the massive surveillance system that we need to detect infection quickly we re going to have we re hopefully going to have in place we should have that in place we ll have the tools to do that so we ll be able to identify cases when there are small outbreaks in the fall and use case based interventions basically isolating people with the infection and their close contacts but what we also need is a drug that could be used either as a preventative tool a prophylaxis as a bridge to a vaccine or a treatment for people who are likely to have a bad outcome with this virus there are about four or five drugs that i would say are in advanced stages of development that could be available by this summer we need to place significant bets on each of those drugs and try to pull them through more quickly this is a time for placing bets this is a time for margaret brennan mm hm scott gottlieb for an industrial approach to this it s not happening right now i think it needs to happen there s still time but we need to recognize how important that is otherwise these scenarios of this country just snapping back margaret brennan yeah scott gottlieb and being something more than eighty percent economy just aren t going to come to fruition and we need to prepare for what it looks like when you have a slower economy and more people unemployed in the fall margaret brennan i think it s an important point because you re saying there the science is not supportive of the economic theory that this is just going to be a sharp return to what was normal scott gottlieb not unless we have the kind of breakthrough that we should be able to obtain like i said one of these drugs should work the the strategy that looks the most promising are these antibody based drugs where you basically develop an antibody that can directly target the viruses four experienced companies working on this there s every reason to believe this strategy should work it s worked in other settings of viruses we need to start pulling those through more quickly and there s a couple of antiviral drugs that directly target the virus and block its replication that look effective and maybe used early in the course of the disease will be effective nothing s a home run here but we don t need a home run what we need is a better toolbox a good medicine cabinet coupled with margaret brennan mm hm scott gottlieb with very aggressive surveillance that could be enough to really change the contours of the risk in the fall and allow people to feel comfortable going back out again margaret brennan all right doctor gottlieb always good to talk to you scott gottlieb thanks a lot margaret brennan when we come back a look at the devastating financial impact on some of our viewers who are small business owners themselves stay with us announcements molly moon small business owner mollymoon this recovery is going to take small businesses years if we re going to recover at all and i m really afraid that without more stimulus help in another bill all of our favorite small businesses in our cities and towns might be lost forever angie bowen small business owner abowenbluesky my business is a part of the gig economy which means that we work large and small events such as basketball games football games or concerts so as long as people are not allowed to gather together we have no prospect of making money sangeeta lakhani restaurant owner i ve had people that have worked here for seven years you know like these are my kids like i feel responsibility towards them like i do with my own children these kids aren t sitting on savings accounts like these are hourly workers they re tipped workers as a parent to not know how to help your children through something like this it s it s heartbreaking you know i don t know how to help them margaret brennan those are just three stories from business owners who are facing some real financial uncertainty due to the coronavirus crisis to help us put the experiences in context we bring in cbs news business analyst jill schlesinger who joins us from long island jill you just heard some painful personal experiences and we know even if you re not one of the ten million americans who just lost their job this was tough how should people at home be preparing jill schlesinger cbs news business analyst jillonmoney i think this is one of those back to basics moments you know you hear these stories i hear them all the time now and it s really gut wrenching so what do you do with this information you look at your own personal financial situation you start prioritizing your bills well in advance of anything bad happening the consumer financial protection bureau actually has a really good worksheet on its website consumerfinance gov and you prioritize obviously you put your food first and then you go to your shelter you go to your insurances and if you have lost your job and you feel thwarted by your state s unemployment insurance platform keep trying and also know if you ve lost your health insurance coverage the affordable care act actually allows you a special enrollment period if you ve had a loss of income and a loss of a job so you should absolutely check those things out and be sure to know that if you ask landlords and utility companies for forbearance or a little breathing room they are most likely going to give that to you so don t hide check out what you need to do and ask for help where you need it margaret brennan but for some of the small businesses that we ve heard from they are trying to ask for help and they can t actually do it because the applications aren t up and functioning at a lot of the banks that will be lending out the money as part of this government program what are you hearing about whether the money set aside was enough and if this is going to get going soon jill schlesinger well i think that that frustration on friday was pretty dramatic i must have gotten a hundred different screenshots from people who had frustrations trying to apply where the banks themselves were simply saying we don t have enough information from the government then throughout the day it seemed to get a little bit better i would say if you re a small business be very careful go through the programs that are available on the sba website then you will apply and from the perspective of is this enough my fear is that the way the program is set up is essentially for companies to be able to bring their employees back on their payrolls and they may not be up and running in two or three months we got a data out or a poll out rather from the chamber of commerce and when they polled a number of of small business owners twenty four percent said they are going to be out of business within two months margaret brennan wow jill schlesinger so we ve got to get the money faster to these people they need help margaret brennan does the economy look the same on the other side of this crisis jill schlesinger i have been interviewing economists for the last say six weeks and the views have really changed pretty dramatically from week to week i don t think we will have a an economy that is the same when we come out of this you heard doctor gottlieb talk about an eighty percent economy you ve heard different people say that there is going to be winners and losers out of this what i know in my heart and i think what most us are experiencing is this is a once in a generation kind of recession it is going to be worse than the great recession margaret brennan yeah jill schlesinger we are going to come out of it but we are very clear in this this economy and all of us will be changed forever margaret brennan jill thank you for your insight jill schlesinger sure margaret brennan and we have more of those stories from business owners on our website at facethenation com and we have this programming note for you scott pelley reports tonight on 60 minutes about how restaurants and other small businesses are being impacted how they are trying to help out others scott spoke with new york restaurateur and the founder of shake shack danny meyer tonight on 60 minutes announcements margaret brennan isolation stress uncertainty are just a few of the mental health challenges affecting the country during this crisis doctor luana marques is the president of the anxiety and depression association of america she also teaches at harvard and practices at massachusetts general hospital in boston that s where she joins us from this morning doctor it is really hard to think of any kind of comparative event to what we are going through right now the president has said he expects massive drug use massive depression massive numbers of suicide disease as a medical professional is that the mental health impact that you re seeing dr luana marques president anxiety and depression association of america drluanamarques margaret it s really difficult for a lot of my patients and certainly the mental health of the country in general i think before we even talk about the magnitude it is important for us to first remind our country that it is okay not to be okay right now it s important to remind our country that it s okay to have strong emotions and this is why as we turn on the news every morning and we re hearing stories of death of loss of economy of grief and sadness we quickly start to feel our heart pounding and we feel the sense of tension anxiety and fear and that is our normal fight or flight response our biologically adaptive response in moments of tension we just heard the president and doctor fauci talk about the next week being a very difficult week and so the first thing i want to talk about before we even get to the magnitude of this is to remind our fellow americans all of us might have some of this adaptive response and that s okay it s just up to a point eventually it does become too much margaret brennan so what are you telling people to do about that dr luana marques there are three things that i think are really important for us to do margaret the first one is to remember that we are on the state of fight or flight and we need to do anything to cool off our brain so the three ways that you can do right now if you re sitting at home the first one is to remember to unplug and to anchor and what i mean here is give your brain a break from the news a little bit allow your brain to settle and i know it s hard to do it right now so by unplugging you re bringing down that fight or flight and then what i encourage you to do is to anchor on something that closes your brain off walking meditation calling a friend the second thing i urge all of us to do and this is not optional is to charge up is to be able to eat sleep and exercise those three things are things that we know help our mental health but also help your immune system so figure out what you re going to do how are you going to do it and why you re going to do it and anchor on something that gets you going for me i ve been walking and exercising because it s important for me to stay healthy for my family and for my patients and finally i urge us to be of service we know that helping others not only makes them feel better but also ourselves so let s call an elderly neighbor if you can afford send food to those that actually need it or margaret brennan mm hm dr luana marques if you re sitting at home and you know how to sew let s sew masks and help those that need it right now margaret brennan well what about those who don t have the luxury of staying home the medical workers in particular how do you counsel them to continue going back in and helping people when they themselves may be in distress dr luana marques so some of the the techniques i mentioned are important to them but you re absolutely right margaret they re really suffering i did a webinar at harvard medical school this week for first responders and i heard questions like what do i do if i m about to have a meltdown in the emergency room how do i cool off my brain after an eighteen hour shift and that s not unique to the harvard community we ve seen this globally new research coming out from china published in jama psychiatry shows that first line responders are reporting forty fifty percent more depression forty percent more anxiety and thirty five percent are reporting difficulty sleeping so i m going to urge them to really figure out how to cool off their brain one of the suggestions i gave to a friend who is a doctor is if you are in the emergency room and you re rushing around and you re about to go from room a to b take a moment to breathe just thirty seconds you can cool off your brain turn your phone off for a little bit transition i m going home without listening to the news and rely on your fellow first responders they are your source of support and and they re here for you and as mental health professionals we are also here for you margaret brennan all right doctor thank you for your advice and for all of you who are at home and might be feeling overwhelmed with emotions like depression and anxiety you can
