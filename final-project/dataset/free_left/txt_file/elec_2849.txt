given that it is the year 2015 and given that we live in a world where nearly all information known to man is a few thumb movements on glass away from us at any given moment and given that the gateway to that information is usually a web site called google com it s worth considering what people see when they look for more information on 2016 candidates most people if you can believe it are not really paying attention to 2016 candidates yet and will probably end up googling them i know it s weird a look at google s autocomplete results for possible candidates gives us two layers of information what people will see when they search for the candidate and information about what people have searched for in the past we wiped a web browser s cookies and cache and simply typed in the names of possible candidates at google then we added a color coding based on how good or bad for the candidate s political prospects the resulting search recommendations were green is good gray is bad and yes these ratings are obviously subjective and so for some reason jeb s search results are preceded with a link to his wikipedia page perhaps people looked for that more often no matter that his wife is ranked so high in suggested searches is good news bush s wife columba is a native of mexico and reinforces bush s possible appeal to the hispanic community so why did we list family as a possible negative for the same reason that bush is distinguishing himself from his father and brother common core made the negatives list because it is a hot button education issue for conservatives and one on which bush has opposed the conservative right in his party we gave carson a pass on quotes because the incendiary things he has said of late might have a different reception depending on the listener searches for the national prayer breakfast will show his challenge to the white house at the event last year and of course carson s biography poor child turned renowned neurosurgeon is his trump card lowercase t new jersey gov chris christie s rough 2015 isn t helped much by google most of what people want to discuss is his fandom of the often reviled dallas cowboys and his friendship with cowboys owner jerry jones christie s weight loss is one assumes a positive for as polarizing a figure as sen ted cruz texas is he has pretty tame google results the net neutrality link is probably very specific to the moment supporters of net neutrality have strongly disagreed with cruz s position on the matter but we ll see if that lasts cruz s mixed relationship with nasa is probably a net negative but the mention of green eggs and ham the book he read to his daughters at bedtime during his lengthy floor speech in 2013 is a plus former hewlett packard executive carly fiorina is a long shot but what s noticeable here is that hewlett packard doesn t make the cut that s why we highlighted lucent an executive position that went better for fiorina than her time at hp and if you are having people google your name with questions about 2016 it can t hurt to have leadership that high on the list sen lindsey graham s c is maybe sorta running for president to the extent that he is it s to draw attention to his record on calling for more robust foreign policy intervention meaning that the presence of those topics in his search results is exactly what he wants to see former arkansas governor mike huckabee has two problems here the first was his attack on beyonc earlier this year which now features prominently in search results beyonc s results if you were curious do not mention mike huckabee then like bush a mention of common core gov bobby jindal la on the other hand is on the right side of common core in the eyes of conservative primary voters and his devout christianity shows up here as well we didn t highlight islam as a search term but that could be a negative gov john kasich of ohio is just starting to nudge a toe onto the campaign trail it s safe to assume he hasn t gotten as much search traffic as say jindal indeed he hasn t so nothing here particularly stands out kentucky sen rand paul s two weak spots are also possible strong points his anti interventionist foreign policy probably plays better in a general election than in the upcoming primaries in regard to his independently minded father the opposite is probably true on net both are probably impediments to his becoming president former texas governor rick perry s new glasses made people forget about his complete collapse at the 2011 oops debate but not entirely nothing will ever make america forget about florida sen marco rubio s water incident he s probably more worried over the next 12 months about how people perceive his role in the republican immigration bill last year gov scott walker wis has a very common name and that s not necessarily helpful scott walker soused was this some incident that got dug up by opposition researchers no it s a weird song by a performer named scott walker and another named sunn scott walker does drink though as for the college thing that s explored here joe biden was on parks and recreation which is a pretty good deal and people are interested in knowing more he also has two sons who have different google results clinton s google results are fraught there s the question of their net worth and of clinton s age and of course of benghazi the good news no one needs to google to learn who hillary clinton is before doing this post i did not know that former maryland governor martin o malley has nice abs i did know that he hates the wire but his association with the show can t hurt and i did not not about the rumors related to the search term at the bottom of that list if you follow politics closely you know that sen bernie sanders i vt is a socialist but most probably don t and the term isn t very popular sen elizabeth warren mass isn t running for the presidency despite that the second search term to pop up is for her non candidacy and despite that she s on this list what s she known for her not very popular book and fighting banks not terrible former virginia senator jim webb needs all the google help he can get so pointers to this songwriter and to the only thing that s been written about him in the past three months aren t exactly what he s aiming for an important note these results will change and evolve over time a negative google result is not destiny just ask rick santorum
