saying that the disease comes from china meanwhile bigoted republican senators like john cornyn from texas are making the connection more explicit framing chinese culture and dietary habits as the source of a string of modern diseases cornyn s cultural chauvinism conveniently leaves out how our own dietary habits which look strange to many parts of the world contribute to the spread of everything from mad cow disease in england to e coli right here i wonder if the senator from texas would have liked it if we called e coli the american pooping cowboy plague but their hypocrisy doesn t matter what does matter is that trump and a number of republicans are using these terms to distract people from the administration s incompetent response to the virus they re giving trump s aggrieved white base somebody else to blame for our problems their words are working aapi people from all states and backgrounds are sharing stories of hate and vitriol directed at them and their children one man told me on twitter that people are calling his kids coronavirus at school an asian man was sprayed with febreze on the new york city subway the nypd arrested a 13 year old for allegedly assaulting a 59 year old man while making anti asian comments and shouting something about coronavirus if the media were doing their job this would be the story the president of the united states is putting lives at risk during a global pandemic by inciting violence against fellow americans if trump were incorrectly blaming the coronavirus on millionaires and billionaires and rich white people were getting beat up on the subway the press would be all over him to answer for his hateful divisive rhetoric current issue view our current issue var magazine text 343643 var magazine button

americans could die from trump s bigotry the media is giving us a completely different narrative telling us don t take the bait the bait as i understand it is talking about trump s racism instead of his incompetence trump and his supporters would rather be defending trump s right to be racist and horrible than his actual job performance fighting about racism is somehow fighting on trump s ground because nearly half the country does not find trump s overt bigotry to be a deal breaker this is a good political argument only if you center your thoughts on the perceptions and values of trump s base if you think about anybody else the argument that we should functionally ignore trump s racism toward other americans is demonstrably ridiculous look at what happened during trump s coronavirus press conference on wednesday pbs s yamiche alcindor asked trump if he was worried that his rhetoric would bring harm to asian american communities trump didn t answer the question the next reporter realclearpolitics white house correspondent philip wegmann started by saying he was switching gears to a larger question here and then asked about trump s message to rural americans who were already suffering from isolation and despair before this pandemic that my friends is the problem in a nutshell from the perspective of many white media professionals talking about the president s racist attacks on minority communities is the distraction from the larger issue of white people being depressed about coronavirus the only people taking trump s bait right now are members of the media who insist on reprinting and publicizing every slur that tumbles out of trump s vicious mouth i ve got a coronaviruschallenge every major media outlet could take right now stop disseminating trump s hate stop reflexively reprinting his racist nicknames for things stop acting like the republican defense for such racism is a legitimate argument in the marketplace of ideas stop inviting guests who will defend excuse or double down on the president s racism for the love of humanity stop playing donald trump live all he does is spout lies misinformation and bigotry that is going to get people killed the media should be playing trump on a seven second delay at least and bleep him out when he uses racial slurs hell the broadcast networks will show the super bowl halftime show on a seven second delay for fear of a pop star popping out a nipple but they won t bleep out the president when he incites violence against asian americans there is no tenet of journalism that demands that news organizations help trump start a hate crime spree against the aapi community the media is not required to be complicit in trump s fearmongering the only reason it goes along is for ratings and clicks covid 19 we re struggling with the coronavirus in spain but we re vastly more prepared than the us ben ehrenreich trump isn t in charge so who the hell is elie mystal think exotic animals are to blame for the coronavirus think again sonia shah more in this series as for trump he would rather have people talking about his racism because he knows that the media has thus far been unable to cover his racism without devolving into a both sides athon check out this meekly titled new york times article it s a classic example of reporting on the controversy instead of reporting on the mendacity of president trump the three authors dedicate a couple of paragraphs to critics who take trump to task for his racist remarks followed by a couple of paragraphs in which trump people defend those racist remarks they do a bit about how public health officials refer to diseases by their scientific names then cut the moral authority of that information by quoting republicans talking about spanish flu this is the kind of coverage of trump s racism that gives aid and comfort to racists and legitimizes bigotry as one option among many to meet the threat of donald trump in this moment and every moment the media must do better who the heck cares which kind of xenophobic nicknames were used for diseases in the past how is it relevant that one of the worst pandemics of the 20th century was called the spanish flu even though the first reported case was in kansas if the times were really concerned about putting republican talking points in their proper context its reporters could write people in the past dumped their human waste in their watersheds used lead in paint to make the colors pop and named viruses after the wrong thing it s not hard to talk about trump s dangerous bigotry without giving voice and a platform to that very bigotry astute readers will notice i ve written a thousand words now on this topic without once referring to the coronavirus by trump s nickname i m not special i just have a modicum of intellectual discipline when writing for public consumption it s not too much to ask the new york times and the washington post to get at my level the media even the fox news segment of the media now realizes that coronavirus is bad they now talk about it as an infection that needs to be fought by all americans across all regions and industries trump s racism is an infection too and it also needs to be fought by everybody all the time but especially in times of panic and hysteria or else it will kill people trump is now blatantly blaming the coronavirus on china

on the perceptions and values of trump s base if you think about anybody else the argument that we should functionally ignore trump s racism toward other americans is demonstrably ridiculous look at

controversy instead of reporting on the mendacity of president trump the three authors dedicate a couple of paragraphs to critics who take trump to task for his racist remarks followed by a couple of paragraphs in which trump people defend those racist remarks they do a bit about how public health officials refer to diseases by their scientific names then cut the moral authority of that information by quoting republicans talking about spanish flu this is the kind of coverage of trump s racism that gives aid and comfort to racists and legitimizes bigotry as one option among many to meet the threat of donald trump in this moment and every moment the media must do better who the heck cares which kind of xenophobic nicknames were used for diseases in the past how is it relevant that one of the worst pandemics of the 20th century was called the spanish flu even though the first reported case was in kansas if the times were really concerned about putting republican talking points in their proper context its reporters could write people in the past dumped their human waste in their watersheds used lead in paint to make the colors pop and named viruses after the wrong

americans across all regions and industries trump s racism is an infection too and it also needs to be fought by everybody all the time but especially in times of panic and hysteria or else it will kill people but because trump is directing his hatred at a community of color and because white people could die from trump s incompetence but only asian americans could die from trump s bigotry the media is giving us a completely different narrative telling us don t take the bait the bait as i understand it is talking about trump s racism instead of his incompetence trump and his supporters
