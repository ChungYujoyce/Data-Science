there are moments infrequent but poignant in which i find myself yearning for the good old days of the jeb bush presidential campaign what a time that was the uncomfortable in his own skin awkwardness the sad pleading earnestness the inescapable aura of crushing sadness and defeat the apple watch it was magical and to counteract all that soul withering desperation there was the jeb bush promise the much mocked and self evidently overoptimistic guarantee that under president jeb the united states economy would grow at an annual rate of no less than 4percent that promise was wildly out of step with historical averages going back to 1968 only one president bill clinton averaged 4percent growth over a four year term and jeb based his guarantee off his experience as governor of florida when he averaged 4 4 percent statewide growth on the strength of a perilously large housing bubble that catastrophically popped shortly after he left office somehow that detail never made it into the campaign literature regardless four percent growth was the mantra of jeb the incurable optimist well as it turns out ol jeb was nothing but a piker four percent that s a loser s goal because here comes ted cruz the last man standing between donald trump and the republican nomination promising america that under his watch the economy will zip along at a minimum of five percent gdp growth five percent as you might guess that s an even rarer accomplishment than jeb s guaranteed 4percent harry truman enjoyed 6 5 percent average growth in the post war economic boom the kennedy johnson administration of the early 60s cleared 5percent average growth and since then no president has broken the 5percent barrier for a single term cruz is promising not just to break that trend but to deliver sustained growth at or above 5percent how s he going to get there well ted cruz has a plan per cnn cruz says it s about going back to reagan style economics cut taxes scale back regulation on business and repeal obamacare ted cruz s tax plan is unique in that it represents the most radical and aggressive upward redistribution of wealth of any of the plans offered by 2016 republicans his big idea is to completely restructure the tax code in such a way that the wealthiest americans will reap massive windfalls the overwhelming majority of the plan s cost 79 6 percent goes to helping the richest fifth of taxpayers dylan matthews noted at vox 43 7 percent goes to the top 1 percent alone and as bryce covert writes at thinkprogress the assumption at play here that colossal tax cuts for the wealthiest will trigger massive economic growth is not backed up by research what cruz s tax cuts will do however is explode the national debt by more than 10 trillion in the first decade according to the tax policy center but cruz has an influentialally in his corner art laffer the high priest of trickle down economics who helped craft cruz s plan cruz s tax plan is better than reagan s laffer told cnn i think you ll get growth rates higher than reagan s a good rule of thumb is that whenever you see art laffer extolling the amazing economic impact of a tax cut package assume the opposite will happen laffer s time as a cruz tax advisor was preceded by a high profile stint as tax advisor to kansas gov sam brownback who came into power by promising to turn the state into a laboratory of trickle down economic theory with laffer s help brownback passed a tax package that knocked out taxes on small businesses and deeply cut rates across the board appearing with brownback to hype the tax scheme laffer confidently predicted it would succeed beyond everyone s wildest dreams this will lead to enormous prosperity laffer told a group of kansans in 2012 you are moving into the pro growth world and believe me it will work it did not work the cuts predictably sent the state into a budget crisis as it scrambled to cover a series of massive deficits to pay for these tax cuts which overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy kansas imposed deep cuts to social programs and passed new consumption taxes that disproportionately affect the poor and what did kansans get for all this pain not much in 2015 job growth in kansas was a mere 0 1 percent even as the nation s economy grew 1 9 percent brownback pledged to bring 100 000 new jobs to the state in his second term as of january he has brought 700 what s more personal income growth slowed dramatically since the tax cuts went into effect between 2010 and 2012 kansas saw income growth of 6 1 percent good for 12th in the nation from 2013 to 2015 that rate was 3 6 percent good for 41st as for laffer he later clarified that when he said the tax cut plan would bring enormous prosperity he didn t mean it would happen immediately you have to view this over ten years he told a kansas city star columnist last october it will work in kansas that unfortunately directly contradicted what he wrote in a 2012 report stating that he advised oklahoma kansas and other states to cut their income tax rates if they want the most effective immediate and lasting boost to their states economies now we re supposed to trust art laffer when he says that ted cruz s tax plan will bring wild economic growth that will outpace even ronald reagan s economic record which has become the stuff of mythic exaggeration among conservatives i suppose that s the great thing about trickle down economics its failures can always just be papered over with more and more extravagant promises copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages
