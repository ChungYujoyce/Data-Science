sept 11 terrorist attacks announced thursday that he was running for president but as the former governor george e pataki prepared in recent weeks to announce his candidacy he conceded to friends and allies that he was an extreme long shot for the republican nomination once a formidable figure in the party mr pataki has entertained campaigns for the presidency numerous times over the years seemingly waiting for the perfect moment only to jump in now when his profile has waned mr pataki declared his candidacy late thursday morning in an address to supporters in new hampshire he vowed to enact far ranging changes in washington pointing to his record of attacking government spending and entrenched democratic interests after 12 years of my conservative policies we replaced dependency with opportunity resignation with hope mere existence with dreams a welfare check with a paycheck mr pataki said adding i know we can do the same thing for the united states transcript na perspiring under the lights in exeter s crowded town hall mr pataki laid out a vision that veered from the politically mundane cutting taxes on manufacturers to the soaring curing cancer and alzheimer s in the next decade he pledged to slash the federal work force and called for aggressive military action against the islamic state including the possible deployment of american troops mr pataki who left office in 2006 is an unlikely match for the republican party of 2016 a former yale debater with an easy public demeanor he supports abortion rights and pushed as governor for antidiscrimination rules protecting gays he invokes theodore roosevelt the republican environmentalist and crusader against corporate power as a political hero in recent elections the republican base has gravitated mainly toward more pugilistic candidates with more orthodox conservative views it may be difficult for mr pataki 69 to raise money for his campaign or to qualify for national debates his hope of making a mark depends almost completely on new hampshire the only northeastern state with an early primary and the only spot where mr pataki s social views might find an audience a look at the strategic challenges facing the former new york governor he sees and believes that there s an opportunity in new hampshire to put himself forth in this race said alfonse m d amato a former republican senator from new york and a longtime ally of mr pataki a pataki for president campaign has been long in coming and there is a heavy sense of anticlimax to the announcement in 1998 mr pataki declined to pledge that he would serve a full second term as governor raising the prospect of a national campaign in 2000 that never jelled before the 2008 and 2012 elections mr pataki formed committees to help prepare for white house bids that did not materialize mr pataki has acknowledged the here we go again dimension to his 2016 effort at a gathering of political donors hosted this year by earle i mack a real

time said an attendee who requested anonymity to speak about a private event donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention for a time mr pataki seemed to represent the resurgence of moderate republicanism along with his fellow northeastern governors including christine todd whitman of new jersey and tom ridge of pennsylvania as well as rudolph w giuliani then the mayor of new york city that faction of the party has dwindled and mr giuliani showed the limits of running nationally as a socially liberal hawkish republican in the 2008 election when he did not win a single state mr pataki did not explicitly describe himself as a centrist on thursday but libby pataki his wife called him a model for national republicans i think his message is where the republican party should be she said in a brief interview he s a voice of moderation david p currier a former new hampshire state senator supporting mr pataki said the new yorker would appeal to voters turned off by rampant partisanship we re frustrated with what s going on in washington and what s going on in some respects with the republican party said mr currier who first met mr pataki when he was considering a run for president in 2008 since leaving office mr pataki has seemed at times like a political lost soul he founded a business advisory firm and joined a law firm chadbourne parke but he has struggled to maintain his footing in national republican circles he has associated himself with no fewer than a half dozen political action committees and nonprofit political groups several of them raising and spending only nominal sums on electioneering former representative bob turner a new york republican who now leads the party organization in queens said mr pataki had a cleareyed view of his prospects he is a realist and he has good reasons for pursuing this said mr turner who met with mr pataki and other county chairmen this month mrs pataki said the difficulty of the race was no deterrent to the former governor or his family i really feel like his whole life has really sort of led up to this moment
