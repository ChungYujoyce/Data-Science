the house armed services committee smith who has served on the committee for over two decades discusses the work of overseeing the u s military and the late stage negotiations of the annual national defense authorization act he and morell also discuss near and long term strategic challenges for the pentagon including threats from russia china iran and north korea as well as those stemming from artificial intelligence quantum computing and hypersonic weapons intelligence matters hasc chairman adam smith correspondent michael morell producer olivia gazis jamie benson michael morell congressman welcome thank you for joining us on intelligence matters rep adam smith thank you michael morell i d love to start with some questions about your background if i might you were the youngest person to be elected in the state legislature of washington rep adam smith the technical stat was that when i was elected in 1990 at that time i was the youngest state senator in the country michael morell age 25 rep adam smith yes michael morell was politics something that you always wanted to do where did that come from rep adam smith i always had an interest in it but the main place it came from was my father was a ramp serviceman at united airlines and he was the secretary treasury of his union and he had an interest in politics and he sort of pushed me into it at a young age i had some interest on the other hand i was painfully introverted at that particular point so i was interested but how s that going to work with my basic personality but really what ultimately got me over that was my connection to the community i grew up in in seatac i got involved in a lot of local issues local democratic politics but also just passing the school bond and working on a bunch of stuff locally and that sort of got me exposed to it and then an opportunity came up to run for the senate seat when i was young michael morell do you consider yourself still an introvert rep adam smith that s an interesting question michael morell because i certainly am rep adam smith yes i would say yes you don t change that basic personality but i ve figured out how to deal with some of those it s more than we need to get into at this point but i had issues as a child i was adopted i had family all kind of different things that i ve worked my way through now but that basic personality is still there i ve just learned to work around it michael morell congressman you ve been a member of the house armed services committee for as long as you ve been in congress 23 years rep adam smith yes michael morell you ve also served on the house intelligence committee rep adam smith yes michael morell you ve served on the house foreign affairs committee where does that interest in foreign affairs come from rep adam smith i ve always been interested in politics and history sort of how do things work how does government work and certainly the u s has plenty of those issues but i ve always been interested in international issues just the history of how countries came to be conflicts came to be how they ve worked out those conflicts i ve always been interested in foreign policy since i was in high school but ultimately from a congressional career standpoint when i was in the state senate i chaired the judiciary committee so my orientation was not foreign policy but joint base lewis mcchord or as it was known then fort lewis and mcchord air force base were in the heart of my district when i got elected in 96 and that got me onto the armed services committee and started me down the national security road michael morell congressman perhaps we can talk a little bit about oversight how do you see the job of overseeing the pentagon what do you see your role as what are your objectives rep adam smith couple of objectives one is to make sure that taxpayer dollars are spent as wisely and efficiently as possible and that we are meeting the national security needs of the country and that the dod is doing that and it s i believe a cooperative effort actually you worked in another area of government but there s tension there dod wants to do what it wants to do but i also believe there is a basic respect at dod for the idea of the oversight role the congress must play and there s certainly a respect on our side for dod s role to protect the country and institute our national defense policy and we are the people s representatives basically the department of defense exists at the will of the people and so we try to keep dod accountable because we are responsible to the electorate i guess i d put it better the electorate holds us accountable and part of what they want us to do is hold the pentagon accountable because they re spending roughly 740 billion a year of taxpayer money and there s a tension here it s an incredibly important process and i do think that there has been a concentration of executive power and an erosion of legislative power michael morell in general rep adam smith yes that i think is a problem particularly when you re talking about something as important as national security and the use of the united states military and the spending of 740 billion to the extent that congress doesn t have an adequate say in that you further divide the pentagon from the people in a way that i think s problematic michael morell why has that occurred why has that erosion taken place do you think rep adam smith as a general rule there s i would say a tendency to have the power look if you re at the pentagon as much as they have respect for the process they would also like to be able to do what they do when they want to do it and not have a bunch of members of congress who may or may not know anything about it interfere and i think there s tension there there s tension when elected officials try to politicize it bring the secretary of defense over and then try to make some politically embarrassing argument just for the sake of their political interests and those tensions are always there i would say the reason it s become more concentrated is because democracy has become more difficult and more complicated there was no internet there was no cable television now you have to deal with a lot more constituents it s harder to deal with all of that incoming from constituents and still do the oversight it s become a more difficult and more complicated job because of the democratization of power and the free flow of information michael morell and then from the perspective of what you do every day on the committee in terms of the issues you look at in terms of how far you look out in terms of the strategic and tactical how would you characterize what it is you focus on every day rep adam smith i think a huge part of is efficiently spending the money so trying to figure out how can we get the most out of the tax dollars we spend part of that competition is a big deal to me making sure that as we re sending out contracts there s adequate competition making sure that the pentagon is aware of all of the options the vendors that are out there that potentially could give them a better deal or a better product i think that s a huge part of what we do and another huge part of what we do is to make sure that the troops are taken care of and the way i always like to put this is whatever we decide the mission is we have to make sure that the troops are adequately trained and equipped to carry out that mission and i think it s a huge mistake for us whether it s dod or congress or the white house to say we want to do all of this this should be our national security mission but then we don t have the money and so we put our troops in the position of having to do more than they are trained and equipped to do so matching the mission with the force and the basic money that we spend on it is a huge part of the challenge as well and making sure the troops are taken care of michael morell so congressman you said today that you re making progress on the national defense authorization act and i was hoping you could tell our listeners what that is and why it s so important rep adam smith sure as a starting point it is the policy for the department of defense and that important aspect of our national security every year we authorize everything the dod does the equipment they buy the missions they take on the way the forces are distributed so once a year we pass a defense bill that says for in this case fy 2020 here is what the pentagon s going to spend and here s their policy and it impacts a whole lot of things i know one big issue we re working on this year is housing for military members there s been a lot of mold and problems with the privatized housing so we re putting in a bill of rights to help protect them at the same time we re talking how many f 35 s do we buy how many f 15 s do we buy do we buy any f 15 s updating programs so it is the national security dod policy for the year the other thing that has happened with the defense bill is because the legislative process has become so cumbersome it s one of the few bills that passes every year so a lot of other committees try to hitch onto our bill a whole bunch of different issues because it is some years literally the only policy bill michael morell and we went years without an intelligence authorization act rep adam smith exactly in fact the intelligence authorizing act this year is in the defense authorizing bill that s one of the things we picked up because they couldn t get it through the senate so that s the other role that the national defense authorizing act plays michael morell so we re taping this on a thursday and we re going to run this next wednesday so there may or may not be an agreement on this year s ndaa by then but can you talk a little bit about what some of the big issues you talked about housing already you re going to tackle rep adam smith yes i think some of the biggest there s a lot of stuff in space the big controversy is over the desire of some to create a space force basically to take space out from under the direct control of the air force and make it its own and kind of equivalent to the marine corps the marine corps is technically under the navy but it s also its own separate thing do we need to place that emphasis and there are a lot of issues surrounding space that we have spent a lot of time on there s also been a lot of issues surrounding the chemical pfas which is in firefighting foam which the department of defense uses and has now been found to pollute the groundwater in a lot of places it s not just a dod thing pfas is elsewhere that s been a big huge issue that we ve been wrestling with and there s a lot of policy on what do we do about guantanamo we re down to 40 inmates down there i know this is something you re very familiar with it s costing an enormous amount of money where do we go forward with that policy there s been concern about congressional oversight of military kinetic action going to war how do we make sure that the president comes to congress if he wants to go to war with iran that s been a major area then there s a lot of programs we re dealing with the cost overruns of the ford class carrier how do we handle that how do we make sure we keep building enough submarines we are as you know recapitalizing the nuclear force there s a contract to be awarded on that for the next generation icbm we re working on the b 21 which is a replacement so yes michael morell can you say whether you re going to authorize a space force rep adam smith that s not 100 clear it s kind of funny as we speak and i can say this because this isn t going to air until when michael morell next wednesday rep adam smith wednesday okay it ll be done by then but as we speak literally the president is being presented with a sort of here s the defense bill with the space force and with a couple other things that we want and i m hoping he ll say deal and then that s what we ll do and if that happens i will know the parameters of the bill and we ll see it seems at this point like a 50 50 cal l whether or not the space force is in the final bill there s a lot of people for it there s a lot of people against it and it s bipartisan on both sides michael morell congressman i d love to run through some questions about military capabilities rep adam smith sure michael morell and maybe the place to start is with the most recent national defense strategy commission which i was a member of and as you know one of the co chairs eric edelman he was on our podcast and laid out a pretty stark picture of what that report said and it was pretty stark rep adam smith yes michael morell let me read you three sentences from it america s military superiority has eroded t o a dangerous degree many of the skills necessary to plan for and conduct military operations against capable adversaries have atrophied the u s military might struggle to win or perhaps lose a war against china or russia did you agree with those findings did they strike you as realistic and make sense rep adam smith no i don t agree with those findings and it s kind of hard i don t so much necessarily disagree with the findings as i find that they set an unrealistic expectation about what our u s military is supposed to do you could have read those same findings at virtually any time in u s history except perhaps in the 80s when we spent an enormous amount of money but even then you don t know what you don t know and you don t know what s coming we had this massive military we weren t ready for 9 11 you never know what s coming up so i think part of the problem within the defense committee and within dod in general is you can paint a number of nightmare scenarios all right and say we have to be ready for we can t afford to be ready for all of them there s not enough money in the world to be ready for all of them so if you say if i can show you a scenario that we re not ready for right now then our defense policy is failing we may as well pack it up because we re always going to be failing also i think that way of looking at things leads us to try and spend our way into a problem all right there s no way in this era at this time given how complicated the world has become back in the 80s we didn t have to worry about al qaeda and isis okay china was nowhere near where they are today it was a much more manageable world what i would like us to come to is a more realistic idea of how we deter our adversaries beyond the notion that if we can t guarantee overwhelming dominance then we re done because i don t think we can guarantee overwhelming dominance i don t think we have the money and i think the world is entirely too complicated to get to that point so what should we do number one alliances have never been more important we need partners and we ve been doing this this is part of what was working against the caliphate we partnered with iraq we partnered with the sdf and with the kurds and very low footprint michael morell a coalition of nations rep adam smith exactly and we didn t lose a single american life in defeating the caliphate isis is not defeated the caliphate has been crushed isis still there but we defeated the caliphate without losing a single american life because we were able to work with partners i think that needs to be an important part of our strategy as we go forward and i also think that we need to find other ways to deter our adversaries it doesn t just have to be military international institutions can help us deter our adversaries the state department can help us deter our adversaries we re always saying that if we did it everyone s supposed to be really freaked out about these war games that they hold about imagine we went to war with china in the south china sea we wouldn t win the idea that if china came over to the u s and tried to beat us they wouldn t win either it s hard to win a war on the road against a major adversary should that really be our goal or should our goal be what policies can we put in place so that we don t go to war with china in the south china sea and i worry that we get these bloviated ideas of what the defense budget has to be we don t achieve those objectives and we wind up with a national security policy that our resources can t possibly meet and then we re in that scenario where we are asking the men and women in our armed forces to perform a task that we don t have the money or equipment for them to perform so i worry about that sort of hyperbolic language michael morell so congressman what do you think the u s military should be capable of rep adam smith i think the u s military should first of all it s important to have a surge capacity and i think we underestimate that we certainly weren t ready for world war ii but we surged and we got ready and ult imately we took advantage of it so i think number one the industrial base matters a lot do we maintain the core capabilities of building the ships the planes and increasingly by the way the artificial intelligence the command and control centers the cyber strength do we have that ability to rise to meet an adversary when they come at us so making sure that we maintain a strong domestic economy a strong domestic infrastructure and a strong industrial base is as important as anything and i think we need to consider that when we re looking at what programs to fund and move forward then i think our military should absolutely be capable of deterring terrorist groups like isis and al qaeda and i think we ve done a pretty decent job of that as you know you were there when we were sort of building up after 9 11 michael morell it doesn t actually take a lot of capable at the end of the day it really doesn t rep adam smith no but it takes a ton of coordination and it s really impressive what we ve done now when it comes to sort of here s our national security threat environment which is basically russia china north korea iran transnational terrorists okay so how do we contain those threats i talked about the last one the other four i think there s a bunch of different strategies i think our military needs to be strong enough to deter north korea so that north korea knows that if they engage militarily anywhere in the neighborhood that we will crush them i think we need russia to know that if they mess in eastern europe we are going to make the cost higher than they want to absorb i think we need to have an adequate nuclear deterrent that tells every other country in the world don t you dare even think about using a nuclear weapon because we will obliterate you and i think we need a strong enough military to help deter china from hostile acts in south asia but with china i think frankly partners in the region are vastly more important than our military strength it s going to matter more if south korea and japan and india and thailand and vietnam and all those countries are strong enough to have a united front in deterring china than the threat that we ll send our entire military over to go to war with china but i think all of that can be achieved in a more manageable way for instance we ve had this requirement since i ve been in congress for i think it s 350 ships in the navy there s no realistic scenario by which we re ever able to afford to build i think the 350 ship in the navy led to the lcs okay which former secretary of the navy now spencer and i used to joke about it i had this analogy that i picked up a long time ago for the problem is when you try to make something that does everything it s like a spork it s not a very good spoon and it s not a very good fork it can t really do anything but we wanted to get to 350 ships the lcs was cheaper than a destroyer we could build more of them and then we can count more ships so aren t we better off because we have more ships no you set those unrealistic objectives so i think we need to be more realistic about how we project power and i think we need to really aggressively build alliances michael morell so if you take your view of what we need to be able to do where are we today versus that view rep adam smith one of my ways of looking at the world is i am nowhere near as hyperbolic and paranoid as most people and it s not that i m unaware of the threats it s just that i always go from the standpoint of this is the way the world is there are no guarantees near as i can tell we re not going to be able to build a military that guarantees that we ll never be protected i think we did have a real readiness crisis even on a more modest goal because of iraq and afghanistan because of all that we had to pull from all over the world to deal with those two issues we undermined our readiness elsewhere but we have really rebuilt that since we got out of iraq and now we have a small presence there and we ve reduced our presence in afghanistan i think we re making real progress i think we ve still got a little ways to go to get back to a decent readiness frame but again the reason we got into that readiness crisis is because we were too ambitious in our military goals for both iraq and afghanistan we didn t work with partners afghanistan s a different conversation but i think we re on stronger footing now than we ve been in the last five or six years michael morell one other issue i wanted to ask you about is nuclear weapons you have a particularly interesting view i think on nuclear weapons and i d love to have you share that rep adam smith sure and this comes back to how do we deter our adversaries but be able to afford all the things we need to do going back to that rather stark portrait that was portrayed in the defense review if you believe that and don t misunderstand me i don t think it s necessarily wrong to say that we are vulnerable it s just that being alive makes you vulnerable to imagine that you won t be it s a matter of managing those vulnerabilities or as they always say at the department of defense managing risk that s what they do so what is our nuclear arsenal supposed to do it is supposed to deter any adversary from ever using a nuclear weapon and that s number one people who start talking about how we can use our nuclear weapons to deter nonnuclear threats i think are dead wrong and i think that s a huge policy mistake to rely on nuclear weapons and think that we would ever be the country that would strike first with nuclear weapons and then my position is that we don t need as many nuclear weapons as we have in order to deter our adversaries and i always use china as the example china has less than 300 nuclear weapons and basically and forgive me i don t always speak in the proper policy language china s basic policy is we have enough nuclear weapons to seriously mess you up if you screw with us so don t okay and i think getting into this calculation of if they launch these and we launch those then we no make it clear and i think that it is very clear with the u s currently having something like 4 000 nuclear warheads and i want to maintain that power sorry i don t think we need 4 000 i don t think it needs to go down to sub 300 either but i think as we project out where can we save money in the defense budget when i look at the terrorist threat i don t want to save money by reducing our special ops guys or reducing the outreach we re doing in the world to confront that threat i think having a robust navy is important to be able to deter iran and china there s a lot of areas where i don t want to save money but given our budget deficit given all of the needs if you don t have any area where you re willing to save money then you don t have a plan and i think in nuclear weapons we can meet our objectives of nuclear deterrence which are incredibly important for less money than the nuclear posture review ponders and i know that there s bipartisan opposition to me on this the obama administration was the one who put the nuclear posture review out the trump administration sort of ramped up a little bit further but i just don t think we need that many nuclear weapons to serve the deterrent effect that they re supposed to serve michael morell where do you think we should go in the inf treaty rep adam smith the inf treaty is gone now i think we need to renegotiate and this is a broader issue we are in a very dangerous point right now in the world this is sort of like when the soviet union first developed nuclear weapons and we developed them and it was the wild wild west with the power to destroy the entire globe but then nixon and other we started to negotiate to say okay we don t want to terminate the planet here so let s have an open dialogue about what our capabilities are so that we don t go down the dr strangelove route and miscalculate now that soviet union fell apart and we all thought end of history whatever that turned out not to be correct now russia is rising again they re building more nuclear weapons china is now a major player on missiles they weren t part of the inf treaty they are rapidly developing missile technology and on top of that quantum computing is out there okay which potentially as has been explained to me can basically render any encryption irrelevant all right ai is leading to all manner of capabilities hypersonic weapons we ve got all these weapons that are gamechangers in terms of how you re going to be able to defend yourself we need a new arms control regime china russia and the u s need to get together and say the risk of miscalculation as all of these new and incredibly powerful or what would be the word here game changing weapon systems are available we need to better understand our capabilities so that we can be confident in our own deterrents and confident that you can t overcome our deterrents i think we need to get back into the room and start negotiating michael morell and that dialogue just isn t happening today rep adam smith no it s not happening and this is frustrating to me because we have tried in the defense bill to insert a requirement for that dialogue and we have been resisted and i m not saying what the outcome has to be i just think it s incredibly important that we start talking it s like our conflict with iran now we ve got this maximum pressure campaign i think there s a wisdom behind that iran is having an incredibly malign influence in iraq in syria in lebanon in yemen and i think putting pressure on them to stop that is well worth it all right but they view it as an existential threat so they re going to start lashing out to survive and how are they going to lash out how are we going to respond there s no communication that i m aware of and i ve looked between iran and the u s i guess japan is occasionally a go between i just think it s really important to understand your adversaries michael morell right and talk to them rep adam smith yes michael morell so maybe chairman in the last few minutes we have here just run through some substantive issues and get your reaction rep adam smith sure michael morell china how do you think we should be positioning ourselves vis vis a rising china both strategically and militarily rep adam smith be very present in the region so that the other countries in that region don t feel like they have to bend to the bully that china can t bully them that they ve got another reliable partner in the region i think by and large we re doing that i think that s incredibly important i also think that china is a competitor i don t see them as an existential threat they need us to begin with we owe them 3 trillion i think they d kind of like to be paid they don t want to see us completely collapse they re going to compete with us economically i do think we need to be very aggressive about stopping all of the intellectual property theft that they re doing and try to pull them closer into a rules based society and the last thing i m concerned about is the degree to which china sort of links up with russia in favor of pushing autocracy china didn t used to be sort of an exporter of their philosophy it s starting to look like michael morell they are now rep adam smith they are and i still believe in freedom i believe in political freedom and economic freedom and if china is out there in africa and latin america and the middle east and everywhere else trying to undermine political and economic freedom i think that will inevitably lead to a less stable less prosperous world and we need to make sure that we contain their ability to do that michael morell russia and the deterrence of russia in what we call the gray zone including what they did to us in the 2016 election we have not been successful at deterring them through the use of sanctions how do we do that do you think rep adam smith i think we at least need to begin to counter their disinformation campaign and it s a real hindrance that the president of the united states of america to this date refuses to acknowledge what russia did in 2016 in many ways the whole ukraine issue the president is pushing russian propaganda in ukraine helping them with their disinformation campaign now just about every republican i talk to says we know russia s a threat we know russia did it in 2016 okay what are we doing about it not enough we haven t countered it and i do worry that there are many different aspects to president trump s foreign policy that are troubling in a whole series of levels but taking a step back and just saying let s presume that he has a plan other than just looking after his own business interests what is that plan that plan seems to emphasize he doesn t like alliances he wants the u s to be less involved in the world and he s fond of autocrats that s a problem that enables russia to continue to do what they ve done to undermine our democracy undermine our influence in the world and push kleptocracy and autocracy i need to come up with better words for that but anyway and the economic piece of this is crucial their economy is based on a few folks at the top gobbling up all the money in the most corrupt way possible and then hiding it all over the world including by the way in high end new york real estate but that s another story that s an economic system that is a recipe for disaster all right we need to counter that not let them push that message and i ve had an increasing number of people tell me that as they re trying to make democracy look weak they re succeeding and there s people who say a thousand years from now historians will look back on democracy as a 300 year blip in human history will it survive i think the stakes are that important working right now to try and pass the defense bill i was quoted in a way that i wouldn t like to be requoted so i won t say it democracy is difficult let me put it diff michael morell i heard what you said it was actually very good rep adam smith yes because i m trying to pass the defense bill and i ve described it as it s like space invaders okay all right these five people have this problem okay i ll go talk to them we re good okay and then somebody else has a problem i ve got to go talk to him now and then i ve got to go talk to her in an autocracy it s like he has a problem tell him to get over it so it s hard but it s better than having a system that is unaccountable doesn t face competition doesn t face criticisms because inevitably systems like that atrophy they get lazy they don t get better they stop looking after people and eventually people get tired of it and they revolt and we see stuff like we had in the first half of the 20th century and here i was saying that i m not the hyperbolic type michael morell i know rep adam smith but i think we can prevent all of that but it is a major impediment that we have a president who doesn t pay any attention to any of this he s got his own agenda that is unrelated to 75 years of effort to build the international institutions to build the respect for political and economic freedom to stabilize and make the world prosperous michael morell so you mentioned iran earlier and i thought you painted it perfectly all right misbehavior in the region significant we need to do something about that and the things we re doing about it in terms of putting pressure on them they see as an existential threat so they re lashing out how should we deal with them rep adam smith i think for the moment we need to stay the course i don t think we should have pulled out of the jcpoa because we re going to be better able to corner them if the world is with us and the world was not with us in pulling out of the jcpoa i also think it makes it more likely that iran will go back down the road of building a nuclear weapon and i ve heard a lot of very smart people say things that are completely wrong about the jcpoa they re like after ten years they could go ahead and build a weapon that s not what it says that agreement was a lot stronger than the president and a whole lot of other people have said it is and giving up on that is a problem but what s done is done i think at this point we need to continue the maximum pressure campaign show restraint don t blow the region up but then the other critical part about this and i met with king abdullah in jordan and he articulated this very well limiting iran s money is one way to help make it more difficult for them to mess with lebanon and syria and all these other places but they re still going to do it they ll starve their people before they give up on this the only way to stop iran is to go to yemen go to iraq and give them a better deal okay because iran is basically mob boss politics all right we ll give you guns we ll give you money in exchange for doing what we want you to do if those people had a different offer a better life if the iraq government was functioning if yemen wasn t a massive if you actually built a decent government built economy opportunity then iran would not have the fertile field to go in and sow discord when people are desperate they turn to things like this so we need to keep working syria is a more complicated issue but certainly in iraq we ve got some partners there we can work to try to help develop a better government same in lebanon same in yemen drain the swamp if you will don t give them a place to go to take advantage of people who have been backed into a corner and i think that part of policy has been lacking we re not doing very well in diplomacy under the trump administration and i know we re probably over time here but one final point biggest thing i encountered overseas our partners no longer trust us and they don t want to work with us and it s for a different reason than you might think they know they re sitting down you re the ambassador to whatever country from the united states and you sit down and they talk to you and you make a deal the next morning there s a tweet that undoes it now our partners say why am i talking to you you ve got no power okay you obviously don t speak for the united states of america because the president s going to undo it tomorrow and even if he doesn t now people don t trust our interlocutors because they don t think they speak for the country they think trump just tweets and that s the policy we are really gutting our diplomatic capability because of that michael morell just one more question congressman the morale of our troops how would you characterize it rep adam smith if you re talking about the troops in the state department really bad at an all time low michael morell pentagon troops rep adam smith i think within the military it s been t ough okay and i never served in the military but we ve been at war in one place or another for 18 years now and that s a big drain but i think the morale s pretty good and i think they re doing their job certainly there are problems there s a strong feeling 1 of the population serves in the military does the other 99 care but i think they do increasingly you ve seen programs to help veterans from private businesses from charities from others i think the morale is okay i think they re worried about all the stuff we ve talked about today like everybody else is what s the direction of the u s government we are in a period of high political conflict and i ll tell you if we can pass a defense bill and fund the government through an appropriations process that ll help because i do hear from a lot of military people if the government gets shut down i m not getting paid that s a problem if you guys could do your job fund the government pass a defense bill i think they d feel a lot better about the country that they re putting their lives on the line for michael morell did you get some reaction from the pentagon on the president s intervention in the gallagher case rep adam smith yes they re concerned and look the secretary of defense and i ve known mark for a long time in different capabilities and we have a good relationship he s right the chain of command is the president s at the top of that and ultimately he can do whatever he wants to do if he wants to wake up tomorrow morning and say that the mess at fort hood should only serve bacon he can do that okay he d be an idiot if he did that but he certainly could but i think in the case of military discipline by him doing what he s done he has undermined the chain of command in the following sense if you re out there in the field and you don t think you have to listen to your superior because you know that you can go on fox news and get the president to side with you over the person who s commanding you michael morell that s a problem rep adam smith yes it breaks down the entire principle of the military of chain of command and i know he s at the top it s like in my own office i ve got quite a few people who work for me and if my staff director is given an instruction to go do this and everyone s working on it and then i happen to be wandering by and say oh no i think that s wrong i think you ought to do it this way i m undermining my own chain of command b ecause i m not empowering the people who i need to do the job
