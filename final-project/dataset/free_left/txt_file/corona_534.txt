they had covid i wouldn t trust them to stay inside society is only as strong as its weakest link and right now our weakest links are showing themselves to be literal mouth breathers who can t be bothered to cover their faces the problem is that the rational response is not available to everybody equally for the most part the people who want the stores and bars and beaches open are not the

hannah jones the pulitzer prize winning reporter behind the 1619 project has said that the push to reopening is linked to the belief that covid is disproportionately killing black and brown folks it s objectively insane to risk lives so tweedledee and tweedledum can get together and drool on each other on a sunny day the only thing that allows them to be so unbothered and so unwilling to take minimum precautions is their belief about who is really getting sick i can t fix these people i can t educate them i can t teach them to care about somebody other than themselves in some deep vengeful

seriously the health and safety of their employees and customers will be rewarded while people who only care about themselves will be ostracized to their chick fil a and nascar infields right now my house is the only place where i feel safe from the idiots as we reopen i ll only be going to the places that promise to keep me safe from them the most aggressive reopeners know exactly whose lives they aren t interested in protecting black and brown people old people and working people the washington post grabbed some quotes from giddy reopeners gathered in crowds without protective equipment outside a georgia mall the quotes are breathtaking examples of people saying the quiet part aloud i think you have to live life said jeff lampel taking a sip of beer when you start seeing where the cases are coming from and the demographics i m not worried agreed his friend scott friedel i know what people are going to say those selfish idiots are killing our old people said lampel how do you
