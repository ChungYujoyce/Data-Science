after months of uncertainty donald trump hascommitted to participating in the general election presidential debates i expect to do all three i look forward to the debates trump toldreporters in ohio on monday i think it is an important element of what we re doing i think you have an obligation to do the debates one reason for the long delay in trump s agreement to join hillary clinton onstage this fall had been complaintsabout the schedule in particular two debates thatconflict with prime time national football league games butperhaps the biggestreason for the holdout the identities of the journalists asking the questions at those face offs i ll have to see who the moderators are the republican nominee told time magazine last month yeah i would say that certain moderators would be unacceptable absolutely trump had boycotted a primary debate because he was unhappy with the inclusion of fox newshostmegyn kelly as a moderator the stakes were lower then but he showed he was willing to follow through on the threat as of friday the lineup was out nbc s lesterholt will moderate the firstdebate on sept 26 at hofstra university in hempstead n y abc s martha raddatz and cnn s anderson cooper will lead a town hall style forum at washington university in st louis on oct 9 and fox news s chris wallace wouldhandle the questioning at the final debate on oct 19 at the university of nevada at las vegas why donald trump might not debate hillary clinton the diverse rosternamed by the commission on presidential debates included vice presidential debate moderator elaine quijano also represented a couple of milestones as the first asian american moderator of a general election debate and the first to work primarily for a digital network cbsn none of the names on the list were deal breakers for trump but he has tangled with all of them in the past the gop nomineeprobablyhad no objection to wallace given that he twice agreed to participate in gop primary debates moderated by the fox news sunday anchor but wallace was tough on himat those events most memorablywhen he used full screen graphics to fact check trump on the spot wallace later told me do i take a certain pleasure when i open the gate and he decides to walk down the path and i ve got the bear trap at the end of the path yeah sure holt who moderated a democratic primary debate has likewise tripped up trump with fact checks in a june interview he pressed for evidence to support trump s claim that clinton was asleep at critical times during the 2012 attack on a u s diplomatic compound in benghazi libya and got the casino magnate to admit that his assertion might not be true she was asleep at the wheel whether she was sleeping or not trump conceded who knows if she was sleeping later in the interview holt flummoxed trump by asking how he could say for certain that clinton s private email server was hacked holt isn t the onlyjournalist with a record of throwing trumpoff balance trump participated in a primary debate moderated by raddatz but faced only a few questions from her raddatz split duties with abc s david muir and there were seven candidates onstage the exchanges were uneventful but raddatz absolutely grilled trump last summer in his first interview after saying sen john mccain r ariz was not a war hero she also confronted trump about his rhetoric in general there seems to be a pattern mr trump raddatz said when you re criticized or attacked you often respond with name calling using terms like dummy loser total losers on twitter and elsewhere you even demean some people s physical appearance is that something you would continue doing if you were president isn t that language beneath the office of the president trump has granted many interviews to raddatz s partner in the second debate cooper who moderated two democratic primary debates when the gop standard bearer finally agreed to appear on cnn recently for the first time in more than two months it was on cooper s program that interview produced more headlines about trump s immigration flip flops as cooper pressed him to reconcile the softening he had described to sean hannity with the hard line stance he took early in the campaign at one point in the conversation trump accused cooper of being on clinton s side i know you want to protect her as much as you possibly can said trump who often refers to cnn as the clinton news network the hard questions trump has faced from these moderators were well within the bounds of fairness but trump is not one to limit himself to rational bias claims even those fall moderators who have been involved witha presidential debate in past cyclescan expect to oversee face offsunlike any they have handled before this story has been updated receive the most important
