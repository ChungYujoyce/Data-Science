weeks are likely to shrink the 2020 field and test the campaign trail discipline of the front runners by david siders 08 06 2019 05 01 am edt las vegas with two sets of debates and six months of fundraising finished a new stage is opening in the democratic presidential primary the summer slog for six weeks until the next debate in mid september candidates will shift their focus more completely to the early primary states grinding through a ritualistic run of picnics forums and party fundraisers the wing ding the iowa state fair the summer sizzler londonderry s old home days advertisement for the frontrunners the rigors of a month full of intimate often less scripted public appearances will present a significant test but the weaker contenders will also come under considerable pressure some will likely begin running out of money or will fail to qualify for the next set of debates culling the now sprawling field it was at the iowa state fair in 2011 that mitt romney perilously told a heckler corporations are people republicans tommy thompson and tim pawlenty abandoned their presidential campaigns that year after a weak showing in the ames straw poll before the gop discontinued the tradition four years later in new hampshire hillary clinton welcomed summer with her moving rope line to keep reporters at bay reinforcing her campaign s imperious image the political landscape in iowa is full of corn soybeans and landmines said dave nagle a former iowa congressman and state democratic party chairman an offhanded comment when a candidate is tired a flippant remark can be blown way out of proportion and put a candidate significantly behind or as the progressive consultant rebecca katz put it there s plenty of chances to fuck this all up all of these moments with candidates have been pretty controlled so far in the campaign said katz who advised cynthia nixon in her primary campaign against new york gov andrew cuomo last year but now we re getting into the quote unquote fun part and you re going to see them out there with people really talking and who knows what will happen 2020 dems on the issues food agriculture farm economy nutrition the campaign s summer push began in 108 degree heat over the weekend in las vegas where 19 candidates were drawn to a labor forum then held competing rallies and events at senior centers restaurants and churches in the city and suburban henderson the herd will migrate this week to iowa and its wing ding dinner and state fair speaking to raucous crowds and meeting with supporters but also contending with fried food and hecklers former vice president joe biden s campaign will focus much of its effort over the next six weeks building its organization in the four early primary states with the candidate planning a spate of public appearances such in person visits are vital to locking in support reflected in current polls while also allowing biden to road test and fine tune his campaign messages before public attention turns more completely to 2020 after labor day a biden adviser told politico sen kamala harris who has been slower than some candidates to establish a presence in iowa is planning a five day bus tour through the state to assert herself there sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren are both planning to aggressively campaign in iowa and other early primary states several campaigns are beginning to internally discuss television advertising after president donald trump aired a 30 second ad during the democratic debates last week criticizing democrats for proposing a free taxpayer funded healthcare for illegal immigrants somehow these debates sort of stultified the race in some ways said paul maslin a top democratic pollster we re in the middle of summer and starting to get into late summer and i don t think any major candidate has start to spend serious money in iowa yet or south carolina or new hampshire for that matter he said i think these debates were a weird kind of death trap for most of these campaigns i think now it s going to start becoming much more of a fight about iowa and new hampshire initial polling following the second round of debates suggested little movement in public opinion polls and most observers including advisers to several campaigns do not expect significant swings in public opinion before the next debates it is not impossible however and candidates will try twenty years ago bill bradley used a furious summer of campaigning in new hampshire to pull even with or overtake al gore in state polls putting a scare into gore s campaign mark longabaugh who ran bradley s campaign in the state called august a dynamite time to gain ground in iowa and new hampshire it s a good opportunity to connect to some of those voters in 2007 then sen barack obama used the summer of the off election year to add policy heft to his campaign proposing tax cuts for the middle class and announcing a plan to withdraw troops from iraq but it was still a slog for the future president who entered august 2007 about 15 percentage points behind clinton then candidate hillary clinton buys a pork chop during the 2015 iowa state fair charlie neibergall ap photo in the dog days of summer said doug herman a democratic strategist who worked for obama in new hampshire in 2007 it was a slog we had trouble getting people to show up you ve got people focused on vacation and in iowa they re going to the state fair and i guarantee you they re not going because of the soapbox he said there s opportunity for stealth under the radar movement but it s going to be because you re organizing and you re doing it at a retail level free of debate preparation candidates can focus on staffing fundraising and on messaging that is not dictated by confrontation with other candidates michael ceraso who was south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg s new hampshire director before leaving the campaign last week called august a good month to get the house in order scale hire put their efficiencies in place ceraso who said he is leaving presidential politics to focus on advocacy work around mental health said what a candidate accomplishes in august is a huge part of the campaign s dna in las vegas on saturday juli n castro the former obama cabinet secretary and former mayor of san antonio said his campaign is keeping our head down and just getting stronger and stronger and stronger in this race for many candidates august will remain a rush to qualify for the september debates on friday sen amy klobuchar became the

farinella who ran obama s north carolina campaign in 2008 said the way most campaigns end is your accountant calls you and says you re out of money so the second tier candidates need to find a way to hold on the summer is likely to be a tough time it s often a slow fundraising time anyway he said the whole environment is such that there s likely going to be a lot of stasis things are likely frozen for a bit jaime harrison associate chair of the democratic national committee and a former south carolina state party chair said the question is whether dollars start to dry up and you get folks who

to reporters over the weekend at an event in las vegas as soon as all of you put stevebullock com as part of the story i m sure we ll get the donors but he downplayed the significance of qualifying saying it is voters in early primary states like here in nevada who winnow the field in his answer bullock avoided a common gaffe as nevada gov steve sisolak said when asked what advice he would give
