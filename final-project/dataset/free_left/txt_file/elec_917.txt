 hillary clinton surged to a broad advantage against donald trump in the latest abc news washington post poll capitalizing on trump s recent campaign missteps two thirds of americans see him as biased against groups such as women minorities or muslims and a new high 64 percent call trump unqualified to serve as president these and other doubts about trump have produced a sharp 14 point swing in preferences among registered voters from 2 points for trump in mid may after he clinched the gop nomination to 12 points for clinton now 51 39 percent that snaps the race essentially back to where it was in march see pdf for full results adding third party candidates gary johnson libertarian and jill stein green to the mix makes no substantive difference a 10 point clinton advantage 47 37 7 3 percent among registered voters looking at those who say they re certain to vote in november likewise produces a very similar result 11 clinton in the two way matchup 9 in the four way the national poll produced for abc by langer research associates finds another apparent impact of trump s problems perhaps benefitting from comparison barack obama s job approval rating has gained 5 points to 56 percent matching its high since the early days of his presidency that includes 55 percent approval specifically on handling the economy trial heats are hypothetical they ask which candidate people would support if the election were today which it isn t at least as important are the underlying sentiments informing current preferences and they show the extent of trump s troubles given his recent controversial comments among them the public by 66 29 percent think he s unfairly biased against groups such as women minorities or muslims americans by 68 28 percent think his comment about judge gonzalo curiel was racist regardless of whether or not it was racist 85 percent say it was inappropriate while most americans disapprove of clinton s handling of her email while secretary of state 34 56 percent approve disapprove they re equally disenchanted with trump s handling of questions about trump university 19 59 percent with more undecided most generally the public by 56 36 percent a 20 point margin says trump is standing against their beliefs as opposed to standing up for their beliefs clinton further receives substantially better marks than trump s for her response to the lone wolf terrorist attack june 12 in orlando florida americans by an 18 point margin 46 28 percent say clinton did a better job than trump overall in responding to the attack another result marks a rebuke to trump in his own party on june 15 referring to republican leaders he said just please be quiet don t talk in this survey however republicans and gop leaning independents by a wide 62 35 percent say party leaders should speak out when they disagree with trump rather than avoid criticizing their likely nominee indeed trump is supported by just 77 percent of republican registered voters in the two way test in this survey compared with 85 percent in this group last month and again essentially back to his in party support in march in the four way trial he s at 74 percent among republicans results of this poll temper the notion that last week s brexit vote in the united kingdom marks a broader dissatisfaction with the status quo that advantages trump on this side of the atlantic on one hand nativist sentiment populism and economic anxiety clearly benefitted trump in the race for the republican nomination on the other his general election campaign requires broader support and he s had a dreadful few weeks doubts about trump are reflected in yet sharper questions about his qualifications for office perhaps the most basic hurdle for a candidate to clear and continued widespread anxiety about a potential trump presidency sixty four percent of americans now see trump as unqualified to serve as president up 6 points from an already high 58 percent last month thirty four percent see him as qualified clinton s numbers are essentially the opposite and unchanged sixty one percent see her as qualified for the office 37 percent as not qualified moreover while 33 percent feel strongly that clinton is not qualified many more 56 percent feel strongly that trump doesn t pass this test clinton also continues to surpass trump easily in views of which candidate has the better personality and temperament to serve effectively clinton s vast 61 28 percent lead on this question is essentially unchanged from last month s 61 31 percent for all this clinton is hardly beloved fifty percent of americans say they re anxious about the idea of her as president vs 47 percent who are comfortable with it when it comes to a trump presidency however anxiety rises to 70 percent with just 27 percent comfortable with the idea these are about the same as when last asked in january and the 70 percent anxiety number matches trump s unfavorability rating in an abc post poll last week dissatisfaction with trump and clinton alike raises the question of a third way but partisanship is a strong anchor and this poll indicates little traction to date for an alternative party just 18 percent of registered voters say there s a third party candidate they re seriously considering and when asked to name that candidate a mere 2 percent offer johnson s name and 1 percent mention stein a very low level of unaided recall when presented directly with johnson and stein as alternatives they receive 7 and 3 percent support respectively as noted drawing similarly from both major party candidates johnson s selected by 6 percent of trump s supporters and 5 percent of clinton s in a two way matchup stein by 4 percent of clinton s and 1 percent of trump s the president s resurgent approval rating is particularly welcome for clinton given his reported eagerness to campaign for her his advance is broadly based and political divisions remain high 88 percent approval for obama among democrats 50 percent among independents and just 18 percent among republicans tellingly 85 percent of obama approvers support clinton vs just 8 percent of obama disapprovers obama s approval rating is similar to both bill clinton s 57 percent and ronald reagan s 56 percent at about this point in their presidencies and far better than george w bush s 29 percent that said discontent with the status quo does remain and poses some risk for clinton as the incumbent party s nominee registered voters by 56 39 percent say they d rather see the next president set the nation in a new direction from obama s rather than continuing his course new direction voters favor trump over clinton by a wide margin 64 26 percent but those who want to stay obama s course back clinton even more widely 87 6 percent it s notable too that the number of americans who prefer a new direction is about the same now as it was at this stage of reagan s presidency when the nation went on nonetheless to elect reagan s vice president george h w bush to the top job partisanship can follow political preferences and in this poll democrats account for 36 percent of all adults and 37 percent of registered voters a non significant 3 difference from last month the former is numerically its highest since 2009 the latter since 2012 republicans account for 24 percent of all adults and 27 percent of registered voters about their average in recent years with the rest independents this accounts for little of the shift in voter preferences however even using the same party divisions from last month s abc post survey in which trump was 2 he d now be 8 the reason mentioned above is his comparatively weak performance among republicans 77 percent support compared with clinton s support among democrats 90 percent obama s gain in approval similarly is not fundamentally based on any change in partisanship last month s partisan divisions would put him at 54 42 percent now vs his actual 56 41 percent in this poll there are notable shifts among groups in the latest vote preference results largest is a 16 point loss for trump and 17 point advance for clinton among white catholics a potentially key group that accounts for one in seven registered voters clinton further is now leading among young adults a group in which trump was surprisingly competitive last month trump is 11 and clinton 11 among registered voters who don t have a college degree as well as among liberals and conservatives alike and trump is 10 clinton 11 among white men clinton continues to prevail mightily among nonwhites by 77 15 percent now vs 69 21 percent last month that includes 90 8 percent among blacks and 69 20 percent among hispanics for an adequate sample size this combines results among blacks and separately among hispanics from may and june trump leads clinton by 50 40 percent among whites down from 57 33 percent last month in another division of potential interest clinton leads trump by 57 33 percent in the states that obama won in 2012 24 points while trump leads more narrowly by 51 41 percent 10 in the states mitt romney won four years ago this abc news washington post poll was conducted by landline
