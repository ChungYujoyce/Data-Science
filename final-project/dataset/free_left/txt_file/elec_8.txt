american elections can feel a bit outdated here s how to improve them the 2016 election has already been riddled with complaints of long lines at the polls with voters in north carolina ohio and other states reporting big problems casting ballots 4 000 people are waiting in line to vote in cincinnati right now this is how long the line is pic twitter com bilpngsrzl but as bad as this looks ohioans and north carolinians are lucky in one way at least they can vote early in 13 states you either need an excuse to vote early such as a business trip conflicting with election day or you simply can t vote early at all this is just one of the many ways america s voting system is antiquated from holding election day on a tuesday to requiring that people file extra paperwork just to register to vote there is a lot in american elections that feels outdated it doesn t have to be this way here are nine changes that could make voting easier or otherwise better on election day or before beyond possibly improving the voting experience these changes could help address a serious problem the us has relatively low voter turnout for a wealthy nation meaning much of the population isn t having its voice heard about 53 6 percent of the us voting age population turned out to vote in 2012 according to the pew research center other countries reported much higher shares of their voting age population turning out to vote in recent elections 87 2 percent in belgium 66 percent in germany and 61 1 percent in the uk some of the difference is explained by differences in policies unlike most wealthy countries the us doesn t automatically register voters as germany and sweden do and it doesn t seek them out aggressively to push them to register as the uk does and the us definitely doesn t go as far as belgium or australia which make voting compulsory all of that of course falls on top of more typical voting issues such as a lack of access to transportation to get to a polling place on election day or being unable to take time away from work or family life to vote the policy changes listed above could alleviate these issues some of them particularly the expansion of voting days cost more money it s going to be up to lawmakers and their constituents in different jurisdictions to decide what the right balance of costs and access to voting is but whatever they decide it s clear that voting doesn t have to be as difficult as it is today get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
