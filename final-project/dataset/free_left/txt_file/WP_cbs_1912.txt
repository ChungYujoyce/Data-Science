decisions based on data pac attack an anti trump ad was trending online tuesday thanks in part to an overnighttwitter tirade by the president cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall wiceandcampaign reporter nicole sgangareport the four tweet rebuke targeted thethe lincoln project a political action committee launched last december by well known political operatives including attorney george conway husband of white house counselor kellyanne conway the collection of dissenting and former republicans aiming to upend the president s election released a minute long advertisement titled mourning in america an ominous spin on morning in america the famous commercial spot and 1984 re election mantra of president ronald reagan instead of touting american economic prosperity as reagan s ad did more than 30 years ago mourning in america focuses on the economic impact of the coronavirus there s mourning in america the narrator of 1 minute long ad begins under an image of an empty street before listing the number of deaths due to covid 19 and the number of people now unemployed it accuses the president of ignoring the virus and having bailed out wall street but not main street mr trump attacked the pac at length on twitter shortly before 1 a m calling members rino republicans which stands for republican in name only the president wrote in part you see these loser types don t care about 252 new federal judges 2 great supreme court justices a rebuilt military a protected 2nd amendment biggest ever tax regulation cuts and much more en route to arizona on tuesday morning the president quipped the committee should be called the losers project before turning his attention directly to george conway kellyanne must have done a big number on him mr trump wrote referring to his white house counselor according to kantar campaign media analysis group cmag the lincoln project has spent just 115 000 in total on tv ads this cycle to date including in wisconsin michigan and washington d c its mourning in america ad first aired on fox news monday morning the lincoln project video highlights the effects of president trump s failure as a president and how he s left the nation weaker sicker and teetering on the verge of a new great depression said the lincoln project co founder and former new hampshire republican party chairwoman jennifer horn in a statement in a time of deep suffering and loss donald trump continues with his failed leadership and his inability to put the country before himself drop it a lawyer for warnermedia cnn s parent company has sent a cease and desist letter to mr trump s reelection campaign over what it calls false misleading and deceptive use of the network s programming in a nationwide television advertisement launched sunday cbs news campaign reporter nicole sgangareports the trump ad titled american comeback touts the president s response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and features a discussion between cnn chief medical correspondent dr sanjay gupta and host of the situation room wolf blitzer which aired on march 30 associate general counsel for warnermedia rick mcmurty authored the cease and desist letter according to the network during the cnn program while blitzer pressed gupta about stay at home orders the trump ad appears to reference to the resident s travel restrictions from china while editing together interview footage in the campaign s version blitzer asks is it accurate that if these steps had not been put in place it could ve been 2 million people dead here in the united states the ad jumps to gupta who responds with only yes in his letter to trump campaign s communications director tim murtaugh mcmurty said the advertisement purposely and deceptively edits the clip to imply that mr blitzer and dr gupta were crediting the president s travel ban policy issued in january for saving millions of american lives when in fact mr blitzer and dr gupta were discussing recently implemented social distancing guidelines and stay at home orders issued by state and local governments according to cnn the attorney demanded in his letter that the campaign discontinue airing the advertisement with the cnn clip that has been distorted in such a way as to mislead the public murtaugh also said in a statement that the ad was accurate no discussion of efforts to prevent american deaths from the coronavirus can be had without the understanding that president trump restricted travel from china in january murtaugh said based on that alone the ad is accurate gupta and blitzer were not discussing the travel ban however more importantly cnn is once again the only outlet to reject a trump campaign ad and has now rejected multiple trump ads that are demonstrably accurate this is despite cnn s acceptance of a democrat super pac ad that deceptively edited tape to make it appear that president trump had called the virus a hoax by electronically creating a sentence he never uttered murtaugh continued now cnn is using its own rejection of this latest trump ad to concoct a bogus news story in its continuing effort to campaign against president trump in

to go out this friday texas texas governor greg abbott has acknowledged that reopening the state will lead to an increase in covid 19 cases according to audio obtained by cbs news and first reported byquorum report in a private conference call with lawmakers abbott was asked how do we know reopening businesses won t result in faster spread of more cases of covid 19 abbott responded that the increase in cases is almost ipso facto listen the fact of the matter is pretty much every scientific and medical report shows that whenever you have a reopening whether you want to call it a reopening of businesses or of just a reopening of society in the aftermath of something like this it actually will lead to an increase and spread he said adding that the goal was not zero transmission but to rather use strategies that can continue to contain the spread cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarrosays abbott s public comments had previously pushed the thought that an increase in testing would result in an increase in the number of people that test positive so just because there may be an increase in the number of people that test positive that alone is not a decisive criteria he saidlast week in a statement texas democrats blasted abbott s comments and texas democrats executive director manny garcia said republicans are putting our families lives at risk so their billionaire donors can get richer what texas republicans say in public yet again doesn t match what they say in private he knew people would die after reopening texas and now he needs to own it on

wisconsin the fate of wisconsin s safer at home order is in the hands of the state s supreme court reportscbs news campaign reporter adam brewster the court heard arguments tuesday in a case where the legislature challenged whether wisconsin department of health services dhs secretary designee andrea palm acted lawfully in extending the stay home order until may 26 it keeps schools closed for the rest of the school year and puts restrictions on some businesses and public gatherings isn t it the very definition of tyranny for one person to order people to be imprisoned for going to work among other ordinarily lawful activities where does the constitution say that s permissible justice rebecca kelly said during the hearing an attorney representing the evers administration assistant attorney general colin roth defended the order saying wisconsin law gives dhs broad authority to take actions during a pandemic if the court strikes down the order the evers administration would have to work with the gop controlled legislature on a replacement plan the legislature s attorneys have asked for the court to give them six days to work on a negotiated plan roth argued if the order is struck down and nothing is passed to replace it in time people s lives would be at risk people will die if this order is enjoined with nothing to replace it roth said that is exactly why the legislature asked for a six day stay of any order it understands that if safer at home is enjoined with nothing to replace it and people pour out into the streets that the disease will spread like wildfire and we ll be back into a terrible situation of an out of control virus with no weapon to fight it a separate challenge to the stay home order was filed monday by two people arguing it violated their
