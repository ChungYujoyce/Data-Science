emerging late last year cctv quoted experts as saying it may be a case of vertical transmission referring to infections passed from mother to child during pregnancy childbirth or immediately after the mother had tested positive for the virus before she gave birth afp who director general dr tedros ghebreyesus said wednesday that nations urging their citizens to leave china may not help contain the coronavirus centered in that country ghebreyesus stressed that the vast majority of the confirmed cases were still in a single chinese province hubei so that blanket approach may not help he noted that individual governments were taking the precautions they deemed necessary to protect their citizens but urged them to make it evidence based not just a blanket coverage considering all china and all provinces are the same could be wrong and is wrong he said even in china there are provinces with very few cases dr michael ryan executive director of the who s health emergencies programme also called for calm well thought out public health measures he said the who was doing a systematic evaluation of measures taken by all member states and would share its assessment of the efficacy of those diverse measures with international partners in a bid to bring some cohesion and order to global efforts to control the virus the head of the world health organization sought to calm nerves wednesday as the death toll and number of infections from the new coronavirus continued to rise we understand that people are worried and concerned and rightly so but this is not a time for fear this is not a time for panic it s a time for rational evidence based action who director general tedros ghebreyesus said during a news briefing from the organization s headquarters in geneva we still have a window of opportunity to bring this outbreak under control he noted that 99 of the confirmed cases of the new virus were still in china and 80 of those are concentrated in the central hubei province the relatively small number of cases outside china gives us a window of opportunity to prevent this outbreak from becoming a broader global crisis he said warning that the biggest threat was the disease reaching countries with poor health care systems where it might spread more rapidly our greatest concern is about the potential for spread in countries with weaker health systems and who lack the capacity to detect or diagnose the 2019ncov virus we are only as strong as the weakest link drtedros infectious disease expert dr ian lipkin an epidemiologist from columbia university who is currently advising authorities in china told cbs news wednesday that there is a singular problem at the root of this outbreak and if it isn t addressed there will be similar viruses cropping up every couple of years the coronavirus sweeping through china is believed to have originated in wild animals possibly bats before jumping into the human population and it may well have made that jump in the close quarters that wild animals share with humans food and domestic animals at markets like the one in the city of wuhan i want the wild animal markets closed lipkin said bluntly noting that this new virus is not unique in coming from animals you re talking about hiv nipah virus marburg virus ebola virus influenzas these are all what we call zoonosis these are infectious agents that originated in wild animals and moved into people if you take wild animals and you put them into a market with domestic animals or other animals where there s an opportunity for a virus to jump species to adapt from a bat to a small mammal like a rodent or a ferret and then jump into humans you are creating a highway a superhighway for viruses to go from the wild into people we can t do this anymore we can t tolerate this anymore lipkin who worked with the chinese during the sars epidemic in 2003 said he had personally asked chinese leaders to show leadership internationally by cracking down on the markets which he said exist in other countries too in asia but also in west africa and south and central america we have to shut these wild animal markets lipkin stressed if we don t do that we will see one of these emerging infectious diseases every couple of years columbia university epidemiologist dr ian lipkin is in china advising officials there he did similar work during the deadly sars outbreak in 2002 2003 and says beijing s approach has changed since then nevertheless he says the epidemic in china is very close to growing into an international pandemic we re very close we have infections in multiple countries around the world if they become sustained we ll meet the criteria for a pandemic lipkin told cbs news correspondent ramy inocencio he added however that the distinction simply tells you that something is widely distributed that it s global he said what really matters is how many infected people actually get seriously sick and we really don t know because the data is still coming in lipkin said chinese officials are taking an assertive approach to control the outbreak and they seem to have learned from the sars disaster i ve seen an enormously deep commitment to try and contain this not only for china but also for the rest of the world there is a very different sense here than there was in 2003 he said everyone realizes that the world is interconnected the second flight evacuating americans from wuhan in central china s hubei province arrived wednesday at travis air force base in northern california it was the third flight chartered by the state department to bring americans home from the region at the center of the coronavirus outbreak the state department has said an additional flight or flights would be chartered for the same purpose to depart on thursday from wuhan the last evacuations expected to be organized by the u s government the latest plane loads of u s evacuees fleeing wuhan in central china left behind a life on

checks tokyo olympics organizers on wednesday said they are increasingly concerned about the disruption the fast spreading virus in china is causing ahead of the games which open in just under six months chief executive officer toshiro muto sounded a grave note speaking at a meeting with officials of the international paralympic committee i am seriously worried that the spread of the infectious disease could throw cold water on the momentum toward the games muto said speaking in japanese i hope that it will be stamped out as soon as possible saburo kawabuchi the mayor of the athletes village where 11 000 olympians will stay showed his apprehension i truly hope that the infectious disease will die down somehow so that we will be able to operate the paralympics and olympics smoothly he said

quarantine for all travelers from mainland china in a bid to stop more cases of the deadly new coronavirus the quarantine order which will come into force on saturday will apply to hong kong residents and foreigners chief executive carrie lam told reporters lam gave few other details about how the quarantine would be implemented such as where and how arrivals would be isolated but said it was designed to stop them coming the measure is harsh but i believe after we say all arrivals have to be quarantined for 14 days from february 8 the number of arrivals will reduce lam said who would want to enter hong kong from the mainland and be quarantined for as long as 14 days in view of this we shouldn t have to deal with a large amount of arrivals who need to go through compulsory quarantine
