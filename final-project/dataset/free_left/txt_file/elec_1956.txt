polls has begun to hit the election as a rigged system that could potentially cost him the presidency he appears to be laying the predicate to be able to challenge the election s outcomeshould things go south for him between now and election day from david weigel trump recently pointed to several court cases nationwide in which voter id laws have been thrown out saying the decisions open the door to fraud in november if the election is rigged i would not be surprised he told the post during a tuesday interview the voter id situation has turned out to be a very unfair development we may have people vote 10 times like much of what trump says the rigged riff defies the recent norms of politics weigel writes and like of much of what he says it taps into fears that long predate his campaign one is a growing and unsubstantiated worry that elections are being stolen the other is a broader unease that regular americans are being cheated by wall street by washington and by a duplicitous media those worries have found voice in both parties this year with trump and sanders both rallying their supporters during the republican and democratic primaries with the assessment that the system is rigged now trump is reviving the theme to highlight the possibility of voter fraud in november rep richard hanna r n y a moderate republican who is retiring this year told syracuse com that he will

condemnation yet obama yesterdaydenounced trump andcalling on republican leaders who repeatedly denounce trump s statements to cut ties with their party s candidate greg jaffe the question they have to ask themselves is if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has to say is unacceptable why are you still endorsing him obama asked what does this say about your party that he is your standard bearer speaking at a white house news conference with singapore s prime minister obama said the words were not enough and called on john mccain ryan and mcconnell to withdraw their endorsements of trump there has to be a point at which you say this is not somebody you can support as president of the united states obama said the fact that that has not happened makes some of these denunciations ring hollow meanwhile thetrump campaign wants its capitol hill allies to defend his heavily criticized remarks about the parents of capt humayun khan sean sullivan in an email sent to congressional supporters this week with the subject line urgent pivot khan and tps trump s director of congressional affairs scott mason writes that the media is working against our efforts and our messaging specifically as it relates to the tragic death of capt humayun khan he encourages backers to incorporate the campaign s talking points in press releases and social media posts trump said that women who are sexually harassed in the workplace have three options taking action within their company leaving their employer while still seeking retribution or quitting from katie zezima and philip rucker i think it s got to be up to the individual trump said in the post interview it also depends on what s available there may be a better alternative then there may not if there s not a better alternative then you stay but it could be there s a better alternative where you re taken care of better trump s comments came after he drew criticism monday for saying that if his daughter ivanka were sexually harassed it would be up to her to find a new situation i would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case trump said eric trump later echoed those comments saying ivanka is a strong powerful woman she wouldn t allow herself to be you know subjected to it ivanka trump did not respond directly to her father or brother s comments but said in a statement harassment in general sexual or otherwise is inexcusable at our companies we do not tolerate harassment of any kind our policies both on paper and in practice require that every complaint be fully investigated and if claims are substantiated our h r team takes swift disciplinary action new york times u s district court judge gonzalo p curiel ruled that the trump university lawsuit can proceed to trial in november rejecting the businessman s request for summary judgment and delivering a victory to the students who alleged they were defrauded by trump s now defunct university from rosalind s helderman curiel ruled there was indeed enough evidence that trump university ads were false and that trump had a hand in their creation that a jury should be allowed to decide the issue at the same time curiel rejected a request by media organizations to allow the public release of hours of videotaped testimony by trump in a california lawsuit over trump university the two rulings offered trump mixed results from the federal judge he has repeatedly attacked as biased accusing curiel of being unable to rule fairly in the case because of his mexican heritage trump

donald trump s many business failures explained by kurt eichenwald trump was thundering about a minority group linking its members to murderers and what he predicted would be an epic crime wave in america his opponents raged in response some slamming him as a racist but trump dismissed them as blind ignorant of the real world no this is not a scene from a recent rally the year was 1993 and his target was native americans particularly those running casinos who trump was telling a congressional hearing were sucking up to criminals trump appeared before a panel on indian gaming with a prepared statement that was level headed and raised regulatory concerns in a mature way but in his opening words trump went off script even questioning the heritage of some native american casino operators saying they don t look like indians and launching into a tirade about rampant criminal activities on reservations documents show trump officials agreed to limit rally size contradicting the candidate by politico magazine snate thayer on monday the gop nominee continued his battle with america s firefighters at a rally at the greater columbus convention center in ohio where he accused the local fire marshal and city officials of being part of a political conspiracy to prevent his supporters from attending the event i just want to tell you we ve had thousands of people outside thousands they were turned away for political reasons purely for politicalreasons trump told reporters the problem with trump s charges his own senior campaign staff officials were fully aware and had agreed in writing that the trump event in columbus was to be restricted to a maximum of 1 000 people according to documents signed on friday july 29 by the trump campaign two days earlier trump also accused firefighters of politically motivated efforts to prevent supporters from accessing his venue space and as in ohio colorado springs officials said the capacity had been agreed to by trump s event planners and city officials well before the event trump changed views on ukraine after hiring manafort by politico s michael crowley trump sounded like a supporter of ukraine s territorial integrity last september when he spoke by video feed to a gathering of political and business elites in kiev i don t think you re getting the support you need trump toldthe pro western group that view was in line with other statements trump has made calling for a firmer western response to putin s march 2014 annexation of crimea and support for a pro russian separatist movement in the country s east in recent days however trump has struck a far milder tone while the reason for his shift is not clear trump s more conciliatory words which contradict his own party s official platform follow his recent association with several people sympathetic to russian influence in ukraine they include his campaign manager paulmanafort who has worked for ukraine s deposed pro russian president his foreign policy adviser carter page and the former secretary of state and national security adviser henry kissinger babygate just kidding but worth a watch trump made headlines at a virginia rally yesterday for kicking outa baby seems like he s even violating this cardinal rule of politics of course his response to thecrying baby went viral i love babies i hear that baby cry i like it trump said initially at the rally what a baby what a beautiful baby don t worry don t worry the mom s running around like don t worry about it you know it s young and beautiful and healthy and that s what we want while it is decidedly rare to hear anyone proclaim that they like hearing a baby cry it was a human moment a move by trump to say to a mother in the audience don t worry about it we ll keep the speech moving peter stevenson writes and for a minute he did until the baby dared to interrupt his thoughts on china with a second outburst actually i was only kidding you can get the baby out of here trump said i think she really believed me that i love having a baby crying while i m speaking people don t understand but that s okay he added see video below trump was also gifted a purple heart at the rally a man came up to me and he handed me his purple heart trump told the crowd i said to him is that the real one or is that a copy he said that s my real purple heart i have such confidence in you he added
