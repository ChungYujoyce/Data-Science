clear lake iowa hillary rodham clinton was in political warrior mode as she addressed democratic activists here friday night delivering a fiery rip roaring speech designed to help quiet concerns about her weaknesses as a presidential front runner clinton took the burgeoning controversy over her private e mail server head on saying probes into her correspondence as secretary of state as well as her handling of the 2012 terrorist attacks in benghazi libya are nothing short of a political witch hunt by her republican opponents it s not about benghazi clinton said and you know what it s not about e mails or servers either it s about politics clinton vowed to fight back aggressively saying i won t get down in the mud with them i won t play politics with national security or dishonor the memory of those we lost i won t pretend this is anything other than what it is the same old partisan games we ve seen so many times before i don t care how many super pacs and republicans pile on i ve been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life and i m not going to stop now clinton s remarks came at the iowa democratic wing ding an event that drew four of the party s five presidential candidates former senator jim webb of virginia did not attend to the historic surf ballroom in clear lake sen bernie sanders i vt and former maryland governor martin o malley made impassioned populist appeals that were received enthusiastically by the capacity crowd of 2 100 people the response to former rhode island governor lincoln chafee was more muted though he hit a number of progressive touchstones clinton the evening s first speaker set the tone with a barnburner weaving sarcastic humor into her tough talk she went after her leading republican opponents repeatedly and by name businessman donald trump former florida governor jeb bush wisconsin gov scott walker and sen marco rubio fla clinton cast the entire gop field as out of touch and out of date saying their menu of policy proposals may work in a republican primary but it sure doesn t work in a 21st century america now i know most of the attention these days is on a certain flamboyant front runner clinton said referencing trump but don t let the circus distract you if you look at their policies most of the other candidates are just trump without the pizzazz or the hair bringing up women s health issues she said mr trump s words are appalling but so are the policies of other candidates senator rubio brags about wanting to deny victims of rape and incest access to abortion governor bush says 500 million is too much to spend on women s health and they all want to defund planned parenthood clinton touted her support for president obama s nuclear agreement with iran saying there is simply no viable alternative to prevent iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon but otherwise clinton kept her focus on domestic policies and a sharp contrast with the republicans she included a nod to the african american protest movement that is playing an important role in shaping the democratic primary race declaring yes black lives matter she opened her speech by making apparent light of the controversy surrounding her e mails noting that she recently began a snapchat account clinton quipped i love it those messages disappear all by themselves the audience responded with knowing laughter the three other speakers made subtle contrasts with clinton chafee a former mayor senator and governor said what i m most proud of in my decades of public service is i didn t have any scandals sanders meanwhile began his speech with an extended riff on big money in politics he said he was determined not to have a super pac supporting his campaign and that he wouldn t go out hustling money from the wealthiest people in the country he said his campaign has received contributions from 350 000 americans and the average contribution was 31 20 sanders laid out a liberal agenda from combating climate change to breaking up big banks to economic policies that lift up working families sanders drew some of his loudest applause when he touched on issues on which he differs with clinton when sanders said no keystone pipeline the crowd cheered clinton has not taken a position on extending the pipeline and when sanders noted that he voted against the war in iraq as a senator clinton voted for it though she has since disavowed her vote people in the crowd chanted bernie bernie o malley followed sanders on stage and touched many of the same progressive themes he tried to distinguish himself from the other candidates by noting that he is the only one with 15 years of executive experience having served as mayor of baltimore before being governor o malley ticked through some of the highlights of his record in maryland raising the minimum wage investing in public schools passing tough gun control laws expanding voting rights giving driver s licenses to undocumented immigrants actions not words o
