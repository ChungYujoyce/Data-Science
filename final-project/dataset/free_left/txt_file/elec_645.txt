 fixing personality negatives is a lot easier than fixing character negatives you can t change somebody s character but you can change the way a person presents himself paul manafort the above quote is from donald trump s new campaign manager along with rick wiley manafort was hired recently to professionalize trump s operation what he says here is both revealing and profoundly wrong how a person presents himself or more to the point how far a person is willing to go in order to project an image of himself says a lot about who he is if a man is willing as trump clearly is to say or do anything in the name of self promotion if he shape shifts and contradicts himself on a whim if he says things he knows to be untrue anddangerous because he thinks it will win him the news cycle does that not reveal his character trump is either a nihilist or a fraud in either case his personality and character are inextricably bound but manafort s grand new plan is to convince the republican establishment that this isn t who trump really is a fascinatingreport by the new york times offers a glimpse into trump s post new york strategy all that talk about the rigged system and the hopelessly corrupt establishment is gone turns out trump wasn t serious he was playing a role you might say his frenzied supporters might be surprised to learn this but this is what trump s new handlers want us to believe on thursday night in hollywood florida manafort met with members of the republican national committee to reassure them that trump is on board and prepared to work with the establishment he s so thoroughly denounced on the campaign trail addressing about 100 committee members at the spring meeting here many of them deeply skeptical about mr trump s candidacy jonathan martin and jeremy w peters write the campaign chief paul manafort bluntly suggested the candidate s incendiary style amounted to an act that s what s important for you to understand manafort told the committee members that he gets it and that the part emphasis mine he s been playing is evolving the negatives are going to come down the image is going to change but clinton is still going to be crooked hillary manafort also made it clear that trump s intention is to seamlessly fold his campaign into the party apparatus that he says or has said is broken and part of the problem he trump gave us the mandate to bring together a team of professionals that could finish the job for him manafort said but could also then begin to link in with the establishment institutions that part of our party what you represent what the state parties represent consider what manafort is conceding here if you ve suspected all along that trump s bullshit routine was in fact bullshit you now have confirmation manafort himself called trump s shtick an act which is to say it s a performance and thus not real the donald has spent the majority of his campaign lampooning establishment politicians those low energy losers who have driven the country into a ditch hell most trumpites when asked why they support him can offer only one reason he s not the establishment and yet manafort is saying albeit at a closed door meeting that trump is really aligned with the establishment it s just that he s been playing a part all this time in order to hoodwink his angry and confused base this is a stunning admission which ought to cause an uproar among those who mistook trump s bullshit for honest indignation don t hold your breath though the credulity of the average trump voter shouldn t be underestimated anyone who thinks the donald is sincere and should be president is already a mark if he wants to run an inside outside campaign as martin and peters put it bashing the establishment on the one hand and quietly coordinating with them on the other that s exactly what he ll do and his supporters will happily take the bait sean illing is a usaf veteran who previously taught philosophy and politics at loyola and lsu he is currently salon s politics writer follow him on facebook and twitter read his blog here email at silling salon com copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
