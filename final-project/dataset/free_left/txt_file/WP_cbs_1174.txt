the following is a transcript of the interview with former secretary of state john kerry that aired sunday september 22 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan we re back now with former secretary of state john kerry he s in town as part of a u n push to combat climate change mr secretary good to see you here great to have you here former secretary of state john kerry great to be here happy to be with you thank you margaret brennan we want to talk to you about this climate project but i want to start on iran kerry sure margaret brennan the united states is not required to defend saudi arabia in the wake of this attack but does the u s look weak if it doesn t militarily respond kerry not if we do other things that show strength and confidence in a genuine strategy and policy and that s what s really lacking here i think you ve got to you ve got to go back to the beginning here we had an agreement we have an agreement that the rest of the world supports margaret brennan the nuclear deal kerry the nuclear agreement and i heard secretary pompeo say well we want to get into a place where we know they can t have a nuclear weapon well we re there we were there and france germany britain china russia all still support a multilateral agreement that was a model of multilateral diplomacy we came together the world welcomed this the united nations security council ratified it embraced it and that still is there along comes president trump and he pulls out he broke the agreement margaret brennan you think pulling out kerry he is the one well what margaret brennan caused this escalation kerry the escalation is the absolutely foreseeable and it was foreseen that this is what would happen why do i say that because we were ridiculed for saying that the alternative to what we were trying to do in making the agreement was war was conflict i mean i i personally had leaders in the middle east telling me you ve got to bomb iran we had a prime minister of israel come to america and ask for a green light to bomb so we were averting war and when we signed the agreement in in vienna the initial agreement we all agreed that this was a way to avoid a war and open up a channel of communicating and diplomacy to be able to deal with legitimate other issues that are concerned with iran we re concerned about their support for hezbollah we re concerned about their missiles we re concerned about yemen we re concerned about interference in other countries but what is the best way to deal with that margaret that s the question margaret brennan but can the nuclear deal be salvaged now kerry and by breaking this margaret brennan given that iran is already starting kerry of course of course it could be salvaged margaret brennan to push the limits and cheat here kerry well they i think margaret brennan and there are sunset clauses kerry yes they are look i think and and you ve got to be really clear and honest about what s happening here i believe iran one way or the other was behind the attack that took place that to me is obvious and it s also obvious that it s got to be denied and it will be denied right now because they need the plausible deniability but the president i think is absolutely is actually correct to be evaluating sort of not being rushed into a corner to go to war that is what we shouldn t do but you ve also got to look at what happened afterwards after we pulled out we basically declared economic war margaret brennan right kerry on iran we have been pressuring them maximum pressure and it was entirely foreseeable that that would result in further conflict so we re seeing the unfolding of really a bankruptcy of approach margaret brennan okay kerry the international community can come together now i think there is a way to avert war margaret brennan and that s going to be one of the pushes this week kerry without showing weakness margaret brennan i want to take a quick break kerry sure margaret brennan and have a more extended conversation on the other side of it don t go anywhere kerry great margaret brennan secretary kerry all of you stay with us and a conversation about climate change ahead margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we continue our conversation with former secretary of state john kerry mr secretary at the bit of our conversation where we left off you said you do see a diplomatic off ramp here kerry absolutely margaret brennan away from conflict kerry our allies still support the agreement but our allies margaret brennan the nuclear deal kerry the nuclear agreement but they also support holding around accountable for other issues in the region i believe better diplomacy more diplomacy with our allies bringing people together there is a road to an agreement that could provide a full new security arrangement for the region and deal with the nuclear issue margaret brennan now you famously negotiate negotiated the paris climate change accord i remember you going to the signing with your granddaughter on your knee kerry yes yes right margaret brennan you felt really passionate about this but even you say that was not sufficient kerry correct margaret brennan every democrat running says they re going to rejoin this accord kerry yes not adequate margaret brennan it s not adequate kerry no margaret brennan what more needs to be done kerry an enormous amount we have to transition very rapidly to electric vehicles we have to get to a net zero carbon economy in our country by 2050 we have to by 2030 have moved significantly in the direction of major changes every scientist who has been involved in this for years is telling us we have a certain number of years in order to be able to respond and no nation in the world is responding adequately so we re going to create a movement here in america i believe that will and across the world actually a global movement called world war zero and you can go to worldwarzero com now and there s an introductory page in october we ll be filling out the full web site but we will be announcing this in full with big names a big concept that is going to help change the political dynamic in america it s going to create political accountability around the world for leaders who are not doing what is necessary margaret brennan well about 60 countries at the u n this week are expected to make some kind of pledge to reduce kerry some kind is a good word margaret brennan some kind of pollution if the united states the trump administration and china aren t leading this is it meaningless kerry well it s not meaningless margaret brennan they re the two biggest polluters kerry no it s not meaningless there are countries india china are going to make announcements and it s steps forward but the united states of america represents the second largest amount individually of emissions that contribute to this china is 25 percent we re 15 percent we have to be at the table we have to be involved and and this is a life and death issue as kids i mean 16 year old kids and a lot of children all around the world are saying save the future for us they can t vote in the congress they don t have a position in the boardroom right now so more and more companies are actually coming to the table we re working with a a group called we mean business a thousand companies twenty one trillion dollars of assets they re committed to moving and i believe we can change the dynamic and hold politicians accountable that s the key we did it in 1970 with earth day we created the epa we created the clean air act many other things we have to create political accountability and make this an issue that will motivate people margaret brennan so on that point is there a kerry standard when it comes to endorsing one of the candidates running for president are are is this an issue you want to see specific policies on before you endorse kerry i think this has to be margaret brennan any democrats kerry it has to be one of the top voting issues in our nation and in the world and it has to be one of the top organizational issues that s why it s called world war zero because the world has to be involved because the deniers and the the the distorters and the delayers have literally declared war on people we re they re dying today we have people dying in mudslides dying in fires dying in in in floods farmers are losing their livelihood amazing things are happening and the response is not adequate so we have to make this an issue which goes to the ballot box which americans and people all around the world are saying we have to change our direction it can be done in a way that creates millions of jobs this is not people are really irresponsibly scaring people lying to people telling them you re going to lose your job you re going to lose your way of life no you re actually going to have a healthier life they re going to be more jobs better paying jobs this is a revolution that i think young people are way ahead of the leaders on this and we have to make sure we are accountable to ourselves and to future generations margaret brennan you obviously served alongside joe biden in the obama administration the secretary of state seemed to be supporting on this program what rudy giuliani the president s personal attorney is doing in terms of calling for an investigation into joe biden kerry well first of all it is entirely margaret brennan what do you think of this kerry inappropriate for the president s personal attorney to be involved in another country trying to find dirt on a presidential candidate number one number two what president trump has done is an abuse if he has done it and the way to prove whether he s done or not is release the transcript of that conversation that s how you get to the bottom of this but there s just you know for the president of the united states to be leveraging american foreign policy hocking it extorting the leader of another country if that s what has happened is unprecedented and the last time a president did that richard nixon the republican party stood up and held him accountable for the abuse of power this republican party today is is running for cover and actually inadvertently supporting a cover up if if if what is alleged is true the only way to get at it is release the transcript let everybody see what the president said and if he leveraged american foreign policy and foreign aid to to get a president of another country to be the opposition research margaret brennan right kerry arm of his campaign that is a fundamental profound and deeply disturbing margaret brennan do you know what john kerry abuse of power margaret brennan do you know what secretary pompeo was talking about when he said election interference john kerry i i don t i have margaret brennan i mean were you surprised he talked about that john kerry no idea no i don t i don t know what that is margaret brennan is it an appropriate thing for the secretary of state to be talking about john kerry i have no idea what he was talking about so i m not going i m not going to make a judgment on that margaret brennan you before you were secretary of state you spent decades john kerry i mean maybe he s referring to the russian pieces i mean i don t know margaret brennan i asked him about ukraine so he seemed to be linking it when he said election interference and joe biden john kerry yes but can i say one other thing margaret brennan yes john kerry the the obama administration as a whole administration was working overtime to try to end corruption in ukraine you couldn t move forward to deal with ukraine if it didn t end corruption so that was the focus it was professionals in the state department and and an ambassador who requested that we be involved to try to get a prosecutor out of the way who was not able to move that was an administration policy it was the professional diplomats who requested that we try to do that so i think there s no equivalency here the president s just as you know throwing up a distraction the fact is that that transcript needs to be released in order to clarify whether or not this president has again colluded in a way with another country that is inappropriate margaret brennan can i ask you very quickly about the seat that you held in congress kerry well you can ask but i m not i m not margaret brennan the senate you don t want to pick someone in the primary race kerry no i m just margaret brennan for your old seat in the senate in massachusetts but are you surprised to see this does this demonstrate to you in any way the divide between you know joe kennedy grandson and and scion of that family as sort of the more progressive arm of the democratic party versus someone ed markey who you know well kerry margaret i am not going to comment on what s happening there and i m not going to comment on 2020 at this point in time there s a time when it may be appropriate and i ll i ll weigh in but not today margaret brennan hopefully it ll be with us here on face the nation when you do mr secretary always good to talk to you kerry thank you margaret brennan we ll be right
