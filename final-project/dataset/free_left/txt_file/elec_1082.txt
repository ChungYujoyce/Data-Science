she s taken the hits stayed on her feet and hit back harder again and again and again special correspondent hillary clinton fivethirtyeight tells us is the most dominant debate winner in recent presidential history they did all that ciphering they do over there and decided she won her three debates by 71 the highest score going back to 2000 she did it by being well prepared yes but she also did it and bigly by just standing there and taking his crap god bless the split screen as he spoke i kept my eyes fixed on her face to see if she flinched when he said she belonged in jail and the rest not once and she proved unflappable again and even more so thursday night at the al smith dinner he was so obnoxious he didn t just cross the line he crawled into a cannon and catapulted himself over it she hates catholics really at a catholic event there was hardly a joke to it at all the embedded joke such as it was had to do with emails among catholic aides but nothing clinton had ever said or done it was awful and there she sat smiling laughing cool as you please people ask why she s winning and the usual answer is that trump is such a catastrophe and he is obviously but i say she s winning mainly because she s one tough dame she s made of steel and not trumpian chinese steel and even though she s going to face a wall of total resistance from congress if she s president i say history tells us not to sell this woman short i ve seen it for years i ve covered her on and off for 17 years when she first went up to new york to run for senate all these alpha males were supposed to bury her first the tabloid new york media a metaphorical alpha male was supposed to eat her alive and it took some bites out of her no doubt about that especially murdoch s post and especially in those early months of the race in 1999 when she kissed suha arafat but in time she neutralized them the post never warmed to her during that campaign god knows but the daily news did it endorsed her and she learned how to anticipate the tabs rhythms and return their best serves then rudy giuliani was supposed to crush this carpetbagger he left the race in the spring of 2000 for reasons that didn t have anything to do with her it was about his prostate cancer diagnosis but by the time he dropped out she d been running a better campaign than he had he could hardly be bothered to go upstate and she was a couple points up in most polls you might think he d have beaten her in the end but i can tell you he didn t think so he might deny this now but he told me himself december 2000 that he didn t think he d have won mainly because al gore beat george w bush by 1 7 million votes in the state and rudy didn t believe he could have wooed enough ticket splitters to overcome that clinton 2 alpha males 0 rick lazio wasn t exactly an alpha male but after he got in the race clinton was in an important sense running against the whole vast right wing conspiracy she had so famously named on the today show two years before tons of national right wing money was thrown at stopping her heavyweights came in to campaign against her and the new york state republican party made robocalls linking clinton to the terrorists who d just bombed the uss cole in yemen yes they did don t ask they all thought they could bully her but in the end it was she who conquered them they went too far got hysterical imagine if she a woman had done that she stayed steady as a rock next up was trent lott mississippian consorter shall we say with white supremacist groups and at the time the senate majority leader after clinton won he the leader of the united states senate a body that fetishizes decorum far more so in those days said i tell you one thing when this hillary gets to the senate if she does maybe lightning will strike and she won t she will be one of 100 and we won t let her forget it and she in the face of the boss at her new workplace wishing that she d be struck by lightning she said nothing and got to work within two years most republican senators were working with her and marveling that she was a pretty decent human being after all sam brownback once publicly admitted he had hated her and asked for her apology to her face which she of course graciously accepted and into the bargain she was someone who could really hold her liquor three nil oh there were plenty others before and since back in her first lady days ken starr and bill safire of the times and fred thompson and al d amato and michael chertoff every one of them was going to bring her down they re now deceased safire disgraced starr retired from public service d amato and thompson or endorsing her chertoff she s the one who s standing and now she s two plus weeks away from becoming the first woman president of the united states imagine what she s been through some of it yes she brought on herself the email server the speeches some aspects of the foundation story but most of it has been a cabal of ideologues who ve been trying and failing for 25 years to put her in jail and in two months and 28 days unless something goes really kablooey she ll be standing up there becoming president all the predictions are grim for the post inaugural period she ll have no mandate and republican opposition will be implacable because they ll know that if they can bring her numbers down by 2018 they can romp in the midterms for the most part i share this view but i look back over the carcasses she s left behind of men who were supposed to dominate her and i think just maybe she ll figure something out donald trump who lies when he says and and the has said one true thing in these last 16 months she is tough tougher than he is and tougher than all the men who ve tried to thwart her and those about to attempt the job
