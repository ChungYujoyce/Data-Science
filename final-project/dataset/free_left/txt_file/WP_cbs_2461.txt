south carolina the south carolina democratic party joined the democratic congressional campaign committee in filing a lawsuit with the state s supreme court wednesday calling for provisions that the groups say would ensure the safety of millions of voters ahead of the state s primary in june cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchellsays the lawsuit asks in part that the court determines that voters who practice social distancing during this pandemic can qualify as physically disabled person s who are eligible to vote absentee the lawsuit also urges the state supreme court to recognize that covid 19 severely threatens the administration of elections and voters rights to free and open elections it is the height of recklessness to ask volunteers to risk their lives staffing polls and precincts when the republicans controlling our government have the ability to take action and protect lives by eliminating the qualifications for absentee voting and transition to a mail in voting program said scdp chair trav robertson in an emailed statement separately the american civil liberties union aclu of south carolina and naacp legal defense and educational fund filed a federal lawsuit

excuse requirement which doesn t provide an option for eligible voters to vote absentee during the covid 19 outbreak the state s requirement that a witness sign an absentee ballot will endanger vulnerable voters by forcing them to leave their homes and interact with others said naacp ldf senior counsel deuel ross in a statement election officials must act to prevent the spread of covid 19 by both broadly expanding absentee voting options and making in person voting as safe and accessible as possible the aclu of south carolina legal director susan dunn added in a statement without action

people reported other possible exposures as well jennifer miller a wisconsin department of health services dhs spokesperson told cbs news in a statement on wednesday since we only have data on positive cases without a comparison group of people who were not tested or tested negative there is no way to know with certainty if any exposures at the polls that are reported are in fact attributable to covid 19 illness wisconsin dhs deputy secretary julie willems van dijk told reporters during the briefing on wednesday afternoon that the state continues to monitor people who test positive for covid 19 to see if they participated in the election two weeks ago she said health officials should have a better idea of how many people may have been exposed on election day over the next week we would generally expect anyone who would have had an exposure on april 7 to have exhibited symptoms by april 21 which was yesterday willems van dijk said i would anticipate that over the next week we would be clearing out any reports of positive cases that also reported voting or working as a poll worker major general paul knapp wisconsin s adjutant general and commander of the
