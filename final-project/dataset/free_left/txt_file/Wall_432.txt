advertisement supported by democratic leaders cautioned the president privately that he must consult lawmakers before taking military action by julian e barnes washington president trump warned iran on wednesday against using its proxy forces to attack american troops vowing to retaliate by going up the food chain a hint that the american military was considering a more direct strike on iranian forces but senior democrats cautioned mr trump against attacking iran without consulting congress a step he chose to forgo before the january killing of a top iranian commander that pushed the countries to the brink of war in a letter on march 27 democratic leaders wrote that mr trump must discuss with lawmakers any potential military actions overseas and noted that recent attacks on american forces in iraq highlighted threats that could require a military response mr trump strongly hinted on wednesday that he was considering striking iran if its proxy forces again attacked american troops and said his administration had very good information that iran backed militias were planning more assaults noting that the united states had retaliated after a strike in march by kataib hezbollah an iraqi militia with ties to iran mr trump suggested that if proxy groups struck again the united states was considering directly attacking iranian forces if it happens again that would go up the food chain mr trump said this response will be bigger if they do something earlier on wednesday the president warned iran against a sneak attack on american forces and hinted at reprisal upon information and belief iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on u s troops and or assets in iraq mr trump wrote on twitter if this happens iran will pay a very heavy price indeed mr trump s comments were the latest indication that the white house was considering escalating action against iran or its proxy forces tensions with iran have deepened since the start of the year when mr trump ordered the killing of the top iranian military and intelligence commander maj gen qassim suleimani who was plotting operations around the middle east though both sides pulled back before a wider war broke out a deadly tit for tat has unfolded inside iraq in the weeks since but the lawmakers noted that the constitution and american law require the president to consult with congress before engaging in military action or actions likely to lead to war outside of narrow situations of self defense this administration has largely failed to fulfill this legal obligation the lawmakers continued mentioning the january drone strike that killed general suleimani the letter was signed by the democratic members of the so called gang of eight who are regularly briefed by intelligence agencies on sensitive national security developments speaker nancy pelosi representative adam b schiff of california the chairman of the house intelligence committee senator chuck schumer of new york the minority leader and senator mark warner of virginia the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee the letter cited media reports about the administration s consideration of direct action against iran in response to attacks on american forces in iraq by iranian sponsored militias it was sent on the same day that the new york times reported that the pentagon was planning for a potential escalation in operations against iranian militias secretary of state mike pompeo and other officials have privately pushed for more direct attacks on iranian forces as part of an effort to force tehran to the bargaining table mr trump had resisted mr pompeo s proposal for tougher action noting in the deliberations with his national security team that with iran reeling from the coronavirus a direct attack would appear inappropriate but mr pompeo and some other senior administration officials have become frustrated with the violence in iraq and near daily american intelligence reports that iran s proxy forces are plotting against the united states mr pompeo along with robert c o brien the national security adviser and richard grenell the acting director of national intelligence have argued that bolder action against iranian forces could break the current cycle of violence and give new life to efforts to restart negotiations with tehran administration officials have maintained for nearly a year that a harsh approach toward iran including a campaign of financial warfare would hurt iran s economy to the point of forcing its government to negotiate over its nuclear program and its military operations throughout the middle east instead iran has lashed out with attacks for months against american forces and allied countries mr trump held out hope on wednesday that his tougher stance on iran would restart negotiations he said that he believed tehran was dying to make a deal and that if iran gave up its ambitions for nuclear weapons it could get negotiations settled quickly defense secretary mark t esper said the iranian government had refused an american offer of medical supplies and had done too little to help its people fight the pandemic instead continuing to support its proxy forces i feel deep concern for the iranian people mr esper said the important thing is that the iranian government should focus on them and stop this malign behavior that they ve been conducting now for over 40 years senior military officers have been more skeptical of a stepped up campaign against iran or iranian backed militias in iraq in a memo lt gen robert p white the top american commander in iraq wrote that a new military campaign against the militias would require that thousands more american troops be sent to iraq and divert resources from the training mission at his news conference mr trump said he was watching the situation in iraq closely and had been in touch with the iraqi government about the threats against american forces he said his public comments were a message to tehran to reconsider its attacks it s not a heads up about an attack mr trump said i m giving them a warning there s a big difference i m saying if you do anything to hurt our troops they re going to pay a price advertisement
