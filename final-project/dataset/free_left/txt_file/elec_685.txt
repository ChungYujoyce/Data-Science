 congress president donald trump has nominated a new republican commissioner to the fec sparking democratic pushback at a tuesday hearing i reject the notion that we must rush to confirm just anybody to the post senate minority leader chuck schumer said tuesday about president donald trump s new fec appointee samuel corum getty images by zach montellaro 03 10 2020 06 15 pm edt link copied the federal election commission which is charged with policing federal campaign finance law has been sidelined for months leading up to the presidential election because it lost its quorum but a hearing tuesday to fill a seat on the fec with a new appointee from president donald trump sparked fierce pushback from democrats upset with trump s handling of the vacancies and the nominee s views on election law senate democrats not only disapprove of texas election lawyer trey trainor s public history of supporting lax campaign finance regulations they are furious with a break in tradition by the white house and senate republicans which typically sees a bipartisan pair of nominees advanced together instead of just one nominee the fight drew both senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and senate minority leader chuck schumer to the hearing room of the senate rules committee for an unusual battle of words off the senate floor advertisement i reject the notion that we must rush to confirm just anybody to the post schumer said at tuesday s hearing the record of the nominee we have before us mr trainor raises significant questions about his fitness to carry out the commission s anti corruption mandate but trainor s nomination seems on track even in the face of democratic opposition republicans who spoke on the panel as well as mcconnell seemed supportive of the nominee texas gop sen ted cruz who is self quarantining after coming in contact with a person infected with coronavirus had been slated to introduce trainor confirming mr trainor will restore a quorum and restore an even balance between the two parties appointees mcconnell said so i m optimistic we ll be able to move forward with this nominee trainor had previously served as counsel for trump s campaign and the rnc according to a biography from his former law firm archived by propublica a point of contention for democrats who argued he should recuse himself from cases involving the president the texan has also argued against the utility of publicly disclosing political donors details instead saying more attention should be focused on lobbying according to a review of his public remarks by the washington post trainor sought to clean up his previous comments in his opening statement t he u s supreme court has held that our current campaign finance regulations particularly the disclosure regime are an allowable exception to the first amendment for the purpose of deterring corruption the fec has six senate confirmed commissioners who serve six year staggered terms by law no more than three commissioners can belong to the same party they are allowed to serve past their terms until replacements are confirmed in practice this has led to attrition at the agency with commissioners routinely serving past their terms as of late with nominees rarely put up by successive white houses the commission needs at least four commissioners to have a quorum the agency lost that at the end of august when republican commissioner matthew peterson left for a job at a law firm peterson had also been nominated for a federal judgeship but withdrew after a botched confirmation hearing trainor was nominated to fill peterson s seat for a term ending in 2023 all three of the remaining commissioners one democrat one republican and an independent who usually votes with democratic commissioners are serving well past their original terms having all been confirmed during the second bush administration republicans maintained that it was crucial to move forward with trainor s nomination now because the agency lacked a quorum which has been the case for the last half year trainor and republican senators noted the well extended terms of the current commissioners with trainor saying deadlock at the commission are likely a function of the overextended stays mcconnell advocated for a full new slate of commissioners to be nominated at the hearing democrats and some good governance groups have opposed trainor s nomination and argued that he should be paired with a new democratic nominee it is unacceptable to only nominate the republican candidate to the fec when there is a fully vetted democratic candidate pending read a letter from a group of largely liberal leaning organizations including end citizens united action fund and the people for the american way there is no excuse to refuse consideration of the democratic nominee doing so is sheer partisan politics and undermines the integrity of a fair and balanced appointment process for this bipartisan agency the letter also argued that trainor s positions are antithetical to the purpose of the commission and our campaign finance laws the letter did not identify who democrats put forward to the white house as a potential nominee sen amy klobuchar d minn the ranking member of the committee said the democrats pick was a woman of color who had been vetted and cleared but not nominated but also did not name the pick klobuchar declined to name the potential nominee after the hearing but the center for public integrity previously identified the democrats pick as shana broussard an attorney and assistant to current fec commissioner steven walther other groups like issue one and campaign legal center both of which are nonpartisan and argue for more robust campaign finance regulation and enforcement did not sign on to the letter but have argued trainor is unqualified trainor did garner support from the institute of free speech which was founded by a former fec commissioner that pushes for lighter regulations
