house has officially released its annual budget proposal which includes spending cuts to safety net programs like medicaid and the children s health insurance program to reiterate the president s budget often bears little resemblance to the final package approved by congress but the proposal is read for signs of the administration s priorities in the case of this year s budget a number of commentators noted trump pledged not to cut social security or medicare two days before releasing a proposal that called for just that we will not be touching your social security or medicare in fiscal 2021 budget only the democrats will destroy them by destroying our country s greatest ever economy the washington post has more details on the budget the budget would cut medicaid and the children s health insurance program and also wring savings from medicare despite trump s repeated promises to safeguard medicare and social security it takes aim at domestic spending with cuts that are sure to be rejected by congress including slashing the environmental protection agency budget by 26 5 percent over the next year and cutting the budget of the health and human services department by 9 percent it would target the education department is for a nearly 8 percent cut the interior department would be cut 13 4 percent and the housing and urban development department would be cut 15 2 percent the state department and u s agency for international development would be cut by 22 percent the proposed cuts stand in contrast to proposals by major democratic candidates to expand environmental education and health care spending setting up a clash between trump and his 2020 rivals over their major campaign priorities 5 36pm gmt 17 36 two other interesting numbers from the latest new hampshire poll only half of likely democratic primary voters say they are definitely decided on who they will support and although amy klobuchar s 7 showing in the poll put her in fifth place the minnesota senator saw a noticeable uptick in support after her impressive debate performance indicating she could still pull off a surprise tomorrow night it seems to me that every fully

klobuchar 7 https t co zvasfrtqg1 joe biden is a distant third at 11 putting him in a virtual tie with elizabeth warren at 10 and despite her strong debate performance amy klobuchar registers at only 7 biden has already been trying to downplay expectations in new hampshire predicting that he will take a hit there as he did in iowa the former vice president has instead tried to redirect attention to the next two voting states of nevada and south carolina where he is expected to perform better but there s no question that sanders will be in a strong position leaving new hampshire if he can win there after fighting buttigieg to a near draw in iowa it would likely solidify sanders position as the frontrunner in the race 5 03pm gmt 17 03 hosting a business session with a group of governors at

voters ahead of the 2020 election to prevent eligible voters from being wrongfully removed from the voter rolls the texting push from the group all voting is local comes amid growing alarm in the united states over the way election officials can remove someone from the rolls while giving them limited notice several states remove people from the rolls if they don t vote over a period of years and miss mailings from election officials asking them to confirm their address federal law requires states to regularly clean their voter rolls but critics say using mailers and voting inactivity is not a reliable way to identify voters who move they say it disenfranchises people who don t vote and discard a government mailing that looks like junk they also say it s a process that favors republicans because young people and minorities who tend to favor democrats are more likely to move georgia and ohio removed around 250 000 combined voters using the process in 2019 the texting effort will focus on four key 2020 states wisconsin ohio florida and arizona and could expand to others the group is regularly reviewing voting rolls in those states and texting anyone who drops off said kelly brewington a spokeswoman for all voting is local which is part of the leadership conference education fund in this modern era the idea that you re going to send a mailer to people and that s going to be a basis for removing them that s not right said hannah fried the national campaign director for all voting is local you need to be reaching people where they are by text by phone by email the group also plans to test different messaging in the text messages and tracking whether there are particular times of the day that are most effective for contacting people fried said this is a more effective way of doing it it s a cheaper way of doing it and we absolutely think election officials should be taking this on all voting is local says the effort will build on previously successful efforts to get people to update their voter registration in 2018 the group said it sent text messages to more than 380 000 voters in ohio and 62 000 of them eventually updated their voter registration the group was also among several that scoured a public list of ohio voters set to be purged last year the groups ultimately identified around 40 000 errors on the list updated at 4 18pm gmt 3 49pm gmt

democratic party updated at 8 19pm gmt 3 16pm gmt 15 16 with just one day to go until the new hampshire primary the new york times is out with a new report on why and how the iowa caucuses became such a debacle as the smartphone app for reporting the results of the iowa democratic caucuses began failing last monday night party officials instructed precinct leaders to move to plan b calling the results into caucus headquarters where dozens of volunteers would enter the figures into a secure system but when many of those volunteers tried to log on to their computers they made an unsettling discovery they needed smartphones to retrieve a code but they had been told not to bring their phones into the boiler room in des moines as a torrent of results were phoned in from school gymnasiums union halls and the myriad other gathering places that made the iowa caucuses a world famous model of democracy it soon became clear that the whole process was melting down volunteers resorted to passing around a spare ipad to log into the system melissa watson the state party s chief financial officer who was in charge of the boiler room did not know how to operate a google spreadsheet application used to input data democratic officials later acknowledged the iowa democratic party said in a statement yesterday nearly a week after the caucuses were held that it appears pete buttigieg edged out bernie sanders by 0 1 but the narrow margin between them combined with the concerns raised about the accuracy of the results has led some to doubt that final assessment all of this has highlighted the importance of tomorrow s primary in new hampshire giving candidates a clean slate and an opportunity to claim an undisputed victory
