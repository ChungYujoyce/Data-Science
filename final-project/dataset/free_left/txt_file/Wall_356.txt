advertisement supported by meat eating is part of the american identity a tradition that underlies efforts to keep slaughterhouses open despite coronavirus outbreaks by jane ziegelman ms ziegelman is a food historian in the hierarchy of essential things in america it appears cheeseburgers rank near the top the president s recent declaration that meatpacking plants are critical infrastructure and meat is essential under the defense production act speaks volumes about this country s attachment to an abundant supply of beef and pork even amid a pandemic that president trump rushed to issue an executive order that aims to keep meat processors on the job while hesitating to take similar action to ramp up the manufacturing of protective gear for medical workers no doubt reflects the influence of lobbyists for the meat industry but there s something else to consider the perceived essentialness of cheeseburgers and other meat products is also a function of certain distinctly american food habits and beliefs both have deep roots though strongly influenced by britain 19th century american cuisine differed from the motherland in at least two important respects in her 1832 travel book domestic manners of the americans the english writer frances trollope describes the breathtaking quantities of food on american dinner tables even tea she reports is a massive meal a lavish spread of many cakes and breads and ham turkey hung beef apple sauce and pickled oysters equally impressive to this foreign observer were the carnivorous tendencies of her american hosts they consume an extraordinary amount of bacon she writes while ham and beefsteaks appear morning noon and night americans were indiscriminate in their love for animal protein beef pork lamb and mutton were all consumed with relish however as pointed out by the food historian harvey levenstein it was beef the form of protein preferred by the upper class that reigned supreme in status with the opening of the western frontier in the mid 19th century increased grazing land for cattle lowered beef prices making it affordable for the working class dietary surveys conducted at the turn of the 20th century by wilbur atwater father of american nutrition revealed that even laborers were able to have beefsteak for breakfast as atwater was quick to point out a high protein diet set american workers apart from their european counterparts on average americans ate a phenomenal 147 pounds of meat a year italians by contrast consumed 24 doubtless atwater wrote we live and work more intensely than people do in europe the vigor ambition and hopes for higher things that distinguished the american worker he argued was fed by repeated helpings of t bone and sirloin steak during world war i the idea that american vitality was tied to a meat heavy diet dictated how the troops were fed to give them a fighting edge tremendous quantities of beef and pork were shipped overseas enough to provide soldiers with 20 ounces of beef a day or 12 ounces of bacon the cost was staggering but the army refused to trim meat rations as one newspaper reported there will be no meatless days in the army the huns are going to find themselves up against beef eaters and pork fed fighters full of that savage strength that come from fried steak and boiled ham and crisped bacon it s no coincidence that the archetypal american hero the cowboy is a cattle herder or that we claim hamburgers as the quintessential american food or that when mr trump welcomed the 2019 football college champions to the white house he offered them big macs and quarter pounders much of what has defined us as americans is expressed through our meat consumption when the coronavirus began sweeping through meat plants in colorado south dakota and pennsylvania mr trump acted quickly the specter of meat shortages and higher prices along with some friendly persuasion from groups like the national cattlemen s beef association prompted him to open the way to in effect forcing slaughterhouse employees to show up for work in a patently unsafe environment mr trump s move places inexpensive meat over the health and safety of the workers who produce it ever since the publication of upton sinclair s the jungle in 1906 we have known about those perils and too often left them unchecked our way of keeping meat prices down and profits up in more ways than one our access to cheap meat has worked to our disadvantage with a large piece of protein in the center of the plate most often cooked in a frying pan americans never had to test their powers of culinary creativity we never developed preparations so common in other cuisines that turn humble plant based ingredients into high culinary art a meat rich diet also meant that americans were disproportionately plagued by what people used to call dyspepsia what we know today as indigestion for the benefit of all concerned both workers and consumers we should take this as our cue to rethink old eating habits and look at alternative traditions we don t have to look far for inspiration in fact it s all around us in the many immigrant cuisines that rely chiefly on vegetables starches and legumes and use meat strategically as a kind of condiment think for example of chinese american stir fries in which a few ounces of beef a one person serving for some of us is cut into bite size morsels flash cooked with snow peas and used to feed a family of four or consider the magic that italian american home cooks produce with a handful of beans and some macaroni we have options that don t require making workers risk their health is a well stocked meat freezer really more essential than a human life unfortunately mr trump s decision suggests that for americans it is jane
