watch cbsn live by bo erickson may 19 2020 3 10 pm cbs news presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden s search for a running mate is likely well underway based on cbs news reporting several women have been discussed within the biden campaign as likely to be vetted or have been recommended to the campaign by other prominent democrats the vetting process may look a little different this year because of the constraints caused by the coronavirus pandemic biden recently said he expects the vetting process to take at least five to eight weeks previously he said hopes to announce his decision by july while he has also said that at least a dozen women are under consideration sources have told cbs news biden is seriouslyconsideringfive to eight of these potential picks beyond contact with the vetting committee top biden staff like campaign manager jen o malley dillon and other senior advisers are in frequent contact sometimes every day with aides to these women several high profile democrats told cbs news they are urging biden to pick awoman of color long before he became the presumptive nominee in april biden outlined what he would look for in a running mate he said his vice president should have the experience necessary to be president at a moment s notice have strengths where he has weaknesses and share a certain simpatico quality with him kamala harris california senator senator kamala harris of california has long been rumored to be a frontrunner for the position as the former california attorney general harris could bring law enforcement and recent legislative experience to the ticket harris was also the only black woman to launch a presidential bid during this primary cycle however many have not forgotten harris confrontation of biden during the first democratic debate over busing and his remarks about segregationist senators questions surrounding harris time as a prosecutor and california attorney general have also raised concerns among some of the more progressive wings of the party although lately she has been working with progressive legislators on bills in the house and senate harris has become an increasingly visible biden campaigner she has said that she has a great deal of affection for biden and said at a fundraiser for biden back in april he sees people he understands their pain he understands their dreams biden at the same event caused a storm of speculation that harris might be a leading running mate contender when he said i m so lucky to have you as part of this this partnership going forward and added so i m coming for you kid harris was asked during a recent interview with msnbc if she was currently being vetted for the position and she declined to answer if a biden harris ticket were to win in 2020 the democratic governor of the state gavin newsom would appoint a new california senator to replace harris so it would likely not affect the balance of the senate reported by 2020 campaign reporter tim perry amy klobuchar minnesota senator biden recently said he wouldn t be the nominee without the help of minnesota senator amy klobuchar the three term senator ended her own presidential campaign just before super tuesday in march and endorsed biden later that evening in an energetic texas campaign rally the next day with her support biden won her home state of minnesota over senator bernie sanders who won the state s primary in 2016 during her own presidential campaign the senator 59 regularly touted the hundreds of bills she has passed in the senate a statistic the former vice president seems to appreciate klobuchar s formidable debate skills impressed biden during the primary race when she mentioned the democratic debates as she endorsed him he interjected all which you won he has also complimented klobuchar s commitment to bipartisan legislation her whole campaign somewhat mirrored biden s own message about winning back the midwest and the rust belt areas where donald trump flipped in the last election klobuchar has also proven to be an adept fundraiser for biden bringing in 1 5 million for him at a virtual fundraiser in may and as is the case for harris if klobuchar were on a winning ticket with biden minnesota governor tim walz a democrat would choose a replacement likely leaving the senate balance unchanged reported by 2020 campaign reporter bo erickson elizabeth warren massachusetts senator elizabeth warren was for a time one of the main barriers standing between biden and the democratic nomination releasing a succession of plans over the past year i ve got a plan for that became a catch phrase the massachusetts senator often led the policy discussion in the democratic primary she popularized ideas like eliminating student loan debt for most americans recently biden embraced a more fulsome effort to help americans address student debt beyond endorsing biden and unequivocally telling msnbc s rachel maddow she would accept an offer to be his running mate warren has largely stayed away from public lobbying for the job she has focused on oversight and protections in government covid 19 relief packages becoming a leading voice in the senate calling for increased rights for essential workers debt relief for consumers and a national contact tracing program among other measures warren who led the oversight commission for the 2008 financial crisis bailout has also been a critic of the trump administration s coronavirus response warren led democrats choices on who should be biden s running mate and who should be considered in an early maycbs news poll but while she might be acceptable to the democratic base her progressive policies could be a concern for moderate republicans on the fence independents or for the more moderate biden biden has said he would pick someone with whom he is simpatico and his political differences with warren could prove too great the two differ both on prime issues like health care and on messaging as candidates while biden called for a return to order from the campaign trail warren demanded big structural change and while warren swore off high dollar fundraising events at the start of her campaign he frequently made stops on the trail to boost his war chest the two famously clashed over bankruptcy reform a decade and a half ago before warren ever ran for office but in march biden backed warren s latest bankruptcy plan demonstrating a willingness to bend to some of her more progressive views in a video released sunday the two teamed up on what had been a staple of warren s campaign calling and thanking small dollar donors i was kidding with the senator a moment ago i said you know i used to call my contributors but i never had as many until she endorsed me he said and so i m counting on her a great deal not just for endorsement but for her ideas and her leadership reported by 2020 campaign reporter zak hudak catherine cortez masto nevada senatorfor many reasons catherine cortez masto is an appealing choice to be biden s running mate she was the first female senator elected from nevada and the first latina ever to serve in the upper chamber prior to her senatorial election in 2016 when she replaced harry reid cortez masto served as attorney general for eight years during that tenure she worked closely with then california attorney general kamala harris and the late beau biden who was then delaware attorney general biden campaigned for cortez masto in 2016 and spoke about his son s relationship with her on the trail cortez masto evoked that friendship last week when she officially endorsed the former vp calling the late biden a good friend nonetheless there are questions about whether she d accept the offer if it were made the governor of nevada is also a democrat steve sisolak and he would be expected to select a democrat to replace cortez masto in the event of a vacancy reported by 2020 campaign reporter cara korte gretchen whitmer michigan governor governor gretchen whitmer has garnered national attention for leading the state s response to the coronavirus pandemic drawing criticisms from president donald trump and driving speculation that she is considered to be biden s running mate biden who won the michigan primary on march 10 said in early april that whitmer is on his list of potential running mates in an interview with politico on april 27 whitmer said she has not turned over any documents to the biden campaign for vetting and explained that she is not lobbying for the job i just know that you know you don t run for that whitmer said that is a selection of the top of the ticket and everyone else should be just busy doing their jobs in multiple interviews throughout the month of april whitmer one of the national campaign co chairs for biden s campaign has not been as forceful as some other vice presidential contenders when asked if she is willing to serve as biden s running mate she said it was an honor to be mentioned with a phenomenal caliber of women leaders but she has repeatedly stated she has devoted her energy entirely to handling the coronavirus pandemic in michigan in an interview with cnn whitmer said she campaigned for two years to become michigan s governor adding that the job that i want is the one that i have while it has been challenging and there have been some tough days there is no place i would rather be than right here in my home state making decisions that are saving people s lives whitmer noted in the cnn interview i think it is the honor of my lifetime to be here democrats are hoping to win michigan after president trump won the state by nearly 11 000 votes in 2018 whitmer who notoriously ran on the message to fix the damn roads was elected governor in 2018 and defeated the republican candidate bill schuette by nearly 10 points michigan was one of seven states in the 2018 midterm election where the governor s mansion flipped from republican to democratic reported by 2020

been on the speculative lists of potential democratic running mates since before the party had a nominee even in losing her run for georgia governor in 2018 the former georgia state house minority leader has been a rising star in the party for years though abrams passed on running for the senate and white house in 2020 she has been forthright in expressing her wish to be joe biden s running mate i would be an excellent running mate she told elle magazine while some critics have questioned abrams outspokenness others have simply said that she is unqualified according to the new york post one biden insider said picking stacey would be like picking sarah palin he doesn t need to throw a hail mary he wants a good governing partner nevertheless abrams has been a stalwart biden supporter and defender in the lead up to the vetting process she was the first potential running mate to comment on tara reade s assault allegations telling huffpo in april that she stood behind biden reported by 2020 campaign reporter cara korte tammy baldwin wisconsin senator senator tammy baldwin could offer a rare mix of progressivism and swing state support to biden s ticket she has spent her time in washington farther left than biden on several issues including healthcare she was an early supporter of medicare for all but she has twice won by a wide margin in the swing state of wisconsin which president trump carried in 2016 a lesbian baldwin would also be the first lgbtq candidate on the presidential ticket for any major party despite some of her progressive positions baldwin has recently shown a willingness to work with the other side in late april she teamed up with missouri republican senator josh hawley to request that the federal trade commission launch an anti trust investigation in the meatpacking industry as companies shut down pork plants after covid 19 infections in workers baldwin has been less blunt than some other contenders about her interest in a vice president job but has indicated that she sees her wisconsin success as an asset to the biden campaign and that she is there to help i am in regular contact with the biden campaign she told cbsn last week i want to make sure that that vice president biden becomes the next president of the united states if baldwin s seat were to become vacant it would likely remain vacant until a special election in 2021 reported

backlash from republicans after the benghazi attack on american government facilities in 2012 the criticism of rice stemmed from her remark the benghazi attack was a spontaneous protest against the
