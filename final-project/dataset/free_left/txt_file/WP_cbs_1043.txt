the following is a transcript of an interview with republican congressman will hurd of texas that aired sunday september 29 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan we go now to texas republican congressman will hurd he joins us this morning from burbank california congressman thanks for getting up early to talk to us you heard senator graham say all of this is hearsay we know the acting director of national intelligence has said he has no reason to doubt the motives of the whistleblower where do you fall on this representative will hurd well first and foremost i think we should be protecting the whistleblower having laws in place to ensure that folks throughout the government are able to get to the right committees information where they think may be wrongdoing is important there are troubling issues within the whistleblowers report but they are allegations and i think that s why we should explore these allegations through hearings where we had a hearing last week we re going to be having some depositions this week as well in order to get to the bottom of this and i will say this you know i i was never in a terrorist organization but i collected a lot of intelligence on terrorist organizations when i was an undercover officer in the cia and so being able to get information second hand is not necessarily a bad thing but i can t i can t speak to the veracity of this whistleblower s margaret brennan right rep hurd information but that s why we bring people and we and try to collect collect facts understand what was said and be methodical about this we shouldn t rush it but we should we should explore many of those issues highlighted by the whistleblower margaret brennan so do you support the impeachment inquiry rep hurd well an impeachment inquiry i i i think this is wordplay being used by by speaker pelosi in order to placate some of the extreme wings of her party the last three times in history that there was an impeachment inquiry of a president it was a vote on the house floor and it was done in a bipartisan way there are many of my friends on the other side of the aisle that have been trying to impeach this impeach this president since january of 2017 but these are investigations we should bring witnesses forward i want to hear from the folks in the state department i want to hear from mayor giuliani i want to hear from hunter biden i think he should he should show up and testify as well too so there s a lot of questions to to be had and anybody who thinks that we have enough information to make a statement on impeachment that s that s incredibly premature margaret brennan the president was captured on camera this week saying that whoever told the whistleblower any of this is a spy and that he should be dealt with in the old way many perceive that to be a threat how did you hear it and what are your concerns rep hurd well again whistleblowers are important i m concerned about the identity of this current whistleblower we should hear from the whistleblower and and talk to this individual about motives margaret brennan will you rep hurd who are they talking to i i hope i know the whistleblower has told both the house and the senate committees that he or she is interested and willing to testify that will be important i hope we can protect this individual s name i find it highly unlikely in this incredibly partisan environment it s unfortunate i believe that that chairman schiff is handling this like this is a tribal council on the survivor and we re voting somebody off the island this is this is serious business we should be proceeding on the house side margaret brennan yea rep hurd the way the senate is and do this stuff in a thoughtful manner and transparency is important after we ve done our work let the american people know what s happening but trying to do this in the public eye is having impact on our foreign policy the fact that i m sure many leaders of other countries are concerned about speaking to the u s president because they re afraid their words are going to get out into the u s press so these are this this type of thing is having an impact on our foreign policy especially at a time when you have the threats like iran margaret brennan right rep hurd especially at a time when you re dealing with the economic shenanigans of china this is where we should be our allies should feel comfortable having conversations with us margaret brennan but to be clear it was the white house who released that call transcript rep hurd that s correct that s correct margaret brennan yeah all right congressman hurd we have to leave it there thank you so much for your insights and we will be watching the developments over the coming weeks we ll be back in a moment watch cbs news anytime
