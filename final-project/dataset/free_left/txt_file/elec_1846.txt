this story has been updated the official hillary clinton campaign launch or re launch was not as big as you might think it was that s meant literally packed into the southern tip of roosevelt island itself maybe 50 yards wide the area allotted for the audience was orchestrated to ensure that it appeared to be packed it was a beautiful day and there was a stream of people arriving even well after the event started so you can call the strategy successful the crowd seems a bit quiet but that very much may be because it is hot pic twitter com s2gh5rdr5c ask attendees why they were there and the first answer was always the same hillary hillary because they supported her in 2008 hillary because the first female president hillary because democrats the only pair that had an unexpected answer were the two people in stop hillary shirts they were from the republican national committee up from d c in case new york city republicans seemed a bit off brand the rnc has arrived pic twitter com 6suwuk9xjs the campaign asked the rnc attendees to turn their shirts inside out before and after pic twitter com wlpikgzap0 josefine cortez a senior citizen who d come in from manhattan backed clinton in 2008 i can t wait to vote for her again she said with glee she marveled at the idea of the clintons now with grandchild back in the white house i have saved money a little money to give to her nancy gautier came with three little girls all under 7 anecdotal but i stand by it a lot more young girls here than boys it s a momentous event to have a woman presenting herself on policy and not just running because she s a woman she said mary blasy from long island brought two friends from san diego to the event jennifer mendoza and 12 year old valentina imes on the way to the event blasy and mendoza explained as objectively as possible they said the difference between democrats and republicans to imes imes seemed to have sided with the majority at roosevelt island after the discussion telling me that she was excited for a different experience with a female president blasy also mentioned a word that came up from other people viable ali ameri and nellie afshar came to support clinton because in ameri s word she is the most viable person he d voted for obama in 2008 and articulated why he d preferred the eventual president then he opposed the war he had a better record he seemed like he was running to make a difference not to continue his career ameri and afshar back clinton but it s clear that at least one isn t super energized about it as the time of hillary s speech neared people were less interested in talking meredith burger breezed in with two snappily dressed friends eager to get in why d they come hillary plus the campaign and burger share a birthday she s 27 years older the music katy perry taylor swift faded and the crowd cheered the moment had arrived and everyone had a good view everyone who made it in anyway the view of those unable to get in pic twitter com 12obweenzz afterward the crowd began to file out for the long wait to get back into manhattan but they clearly felt the trip was worth it i ran into blasy and imes again they were sitting in the overflow area they d ducked out about halfway through i asked imes what she thought good she said inspiring in the way of 12 year olds all over the words conveyed more energy than her appearance did other young people seemed more into it i think she s brilliant jenny kutnow told me i think she s a strong powerful leader and i m really confident in her abilities to be our next president kutnow appreciated clinton tying what are usually considered women s issues into the realm of family issues as we spoke a group of young women passed by that was the greatest thing we ve ever done one said su ya a student at columbia university who is a citizen of china was holding a miniature american flag when we spoke it s my first time to take part in this kind of event she said asked how she felt about democracy she seemed impressed for our leader they don t have to fight against each other for the position she added i can feel the freedom bob kahn enjoyed the speech but still hasn t committed to a candidate for him it s between clinton and bernie sanders the former may have made it easier for him today she laid out an agenda that i essentially agree with kahn said and i think bernie sanders would agree with what she had to say today he said he looked forward to hearing sanders speak and seeing if clinton would agree with that judy wenning who has volunteered for clinton since she ran for the senate thought the speech was fantastic if she can energize people in the country to have hope and to trust that we can do this if we all work together we can change the country though she added it might take a while given republican opposition monte brown an african american man from new york said he supported clinton in part because he believes her more than he believes the republicans he was clearly energized she gives you the feeling that we re going to make history and more importantly that we re going in the right direction this event reiterated that even more so than obama this was obama on steroids he added within an hour the last people had made it to the island s sole subway station howard cash was selling hillary buttons in the roosevelt island subway station three dollars a piece or two for five how are sales i asked not that great he said she s not that inspirational but then he didn t hear the speech how are sales not that great she s not that
